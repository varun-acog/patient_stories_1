    "transcript": "[Music] today on behind the mystery friedrichs ataxia a progressive and debilitating neurological disorder patients can often experience at a young age difficulty walking clumsiness and impaired speech we&amp;#39;re going to sit down with neurologist dr susan perlman to learn more but first let&amp;#39;s meet patient frankie perezola i began to notice symptoms when i was in my freshman year of college i was struggling going up the stairs i could just feel how much harder it was to put in effort into walking that was previously so easy that&amp;#39;s when it first started to hit me like something was going on it was getting more and more difficult to bring the groceries up or even just going down in my car walking across the stage at graduation i was terrified i was more worried about falling at my graduation than i was about actually graduating the balancing act met with neurologist dr susan perlman of ucla medical center who treats patients with friedrichs ataxia freedrax ataxia is a neurodegenerative genetic disorder with mutations in both copies of the fxn gene that makes frataxin protein frataxin protein is necessary for the production of energy in highly energy dependent parts of the body which includes the brain the nervous system the heart so brain cells especially those that control coordination and balance are weakened and the heart muscle which requires a constant supply of energy is also weakened upon graduating college frankie began to investigate her symptoms further it was her godmother and godmother&amp;#39;s husband both in the medical field that spurred her diagnostic journey it was definitely noticeable that my gait was off they gave me the reflex test and i had zero reflexes and the way they looked at each other when that happened i just got the feeling something was wrong that&amp;#39;s how i got introduced to a cardiologist and neurologist the early symptoms are so generic mild clumsiness not running as fast as the other kids in pe class unexplained stumbles and falls but when the symptoms have been present for you know several months usually the family the school recognizes that there&amp;#39;s something wrong being the most common cause of genetic ataxia in that age group the concern about a neurologic problem is thought about either by the pediatrician or by a pediatric neurologist who may be called in to diagnose or if somebody presents with an atypical form they&amp;#39;re a little older than the average or they present initially with scoliosis or rarely they present with heart failure before the ataxia is recognized i went to the neurologist first he&amp;#39;s the one that initially brought up the word ataxia he referred me to getting an mri and ct scan looking back on what i know now i don&amp;#39;t think my neurologist understood what i was describing as how he would understand i was saying i was dizzy but really it was my gait and my vision that was being affected and that was causing me to feel the way i was feeling so overall i was maybe in a guessing period of three to four years the clinical presentation with these key features gate and limb ataxia slowed or slurred speech absence of lower limb reflexes distal weakness in the hands and feet dizziness scoliosis or other skeletal abnormalities if they meet even half the criteria for classic friedrichs adult and pediatric neurologists will feel comfortable ordering the feed rights ataxia gaa expansion test which looks for enlargement of that segment of the gene that then blocks the production of the frataxin protein with neurologic problems that are expected to be progressive early diagnosis especially an early genetic diagnosis you can begin to set out a health maintenance plan for frankie it took four years of getting multiple opinions and meetings with various neurologists to finally have a genetic test to confirm her diagnosis on my diagnosis day i finally met with my neurologist and i had my mom next to me they slid over a piece of paper with my test results and the first line said francesca perrizola has inherited friedrichs ataxia [Music] it i&amp;#39;d been going through years and years of questioning myself and my body overall i felt grateful that i finally received an answer as friedrich&amp;#39;s atexia progresses there&amp;#39;s an increased risk of scoliosis heart failure and arrhythmias diabetes difficulty swallowing slurred speech muscle atrophy and more because of these serious consequences patients should be diagnosed as early as possible to help optimally manage symptoms the team is is key regular visits with the neurologist a general internist or an endocrinologist cardiologist the heart is the primary determinant of mortality our foundation of management does revolve around rehabilitation medicine physical therapy when appropriate occupational therapy speech and swallowing therapy we know that a regular exercise program proper diet um and judicious use of whatever supplements the family would like to try can absolutely improve the unp the young person&amp;#39;s quality of life after i received my diagnosis my mom and i drove home it was a very emotional drive i had to relearn the approach i was going to take in life [Music] four months after my diagnosis i met dr perlman she not only was able to address every single question i had about my body and the way fa was going to affect me but she also had every resource that i needed one being farah or the friedrichs ataxia research alliance i became an ambassador they would send me out to different doctorate programs genetic counseling programs to speak to them and kind of put a face behind fa as well as raising a little bit of awareness [Music] when a patient has been diagnosed with a rare disease like friedreich&amp;#39;s ataxia that relationship between the patient the family and the physician is key they need to have an open dialogue being able to engage with frankie and people like frankie to keep them looking forward you know i was so impressed with her willingness to learn and to really face this problem head-on i&amp;#39;ve just learned that i need to listen to my body and that things are going to be really hard and things are going to be really challenging but i got it i can figure it out [Music] for more information on many of the infographics you have seen here

    "transcript": "[Music] yeah so it is it is classically a rare disease in that sense and that patients um have a pretty you know protracted diagnostic journey um and they&amp;#39;re often misdiagnosed with with various other you know conditions before you know being formally diagnosed you know with fa um this typically happens in childhood and this is associated with you know the gait abnormalities and there&amp;#39;s a early on a bit of clumsiness and you know they&amp;#39;re um you know physicians don&amp;#39;t you know readily recognize that this is uh the disease you know fa that&amp;#39;s progressing so it&amp;#39;s a very classic rare disease in that in that sense um the you mentioned the two types actually the neurologic and cardiac disease typically occurs within the same patient so it&amp;#39;s a function of where it&amp;#39;s a function of progression um and the reason that you know the neurologic and cardiac symptoms are you know the most prominent are basically it&amp;#39;s the the type of disease it&amp;#39;s a mitochondrial disease it impacts energy production in the mitochondria and the heart and the brain are the two organs that require the most energy and so those are the two that are most impacted by you know by the disease um so early on you&amp;#39;ll see you know the the neurologic disease progressing and this is you know both central nervous system and peripheral nervous system as well then typically at adulthood in the same patient you&amp;#39;ll you&amp;#39;ll begin to see the cardiac disease so it&amp;#39;s just a time course at the point in time and this may be different by patient so there&amp;#39;s a different speed of progression and severity but typically it&amp;#39;s neurologic disease followed by the cardiac disease [Music]",

    "transcript": "The tissues of our bodies are made up of trillions of cells each with their own structure and function And if you take a closer look you&amp;#39;ll see \nthat some cells are happier and more energetic than others. Why?  Because these energetic cells have \nactive mitochondria that produce enough energy   or ATP needed to keep the cell functioning \nnormally.  Think of this as the fuel needed to  power the engine that drives the cell.  There are times though when genetic mutations prevent the mitochondria from producing enough ATP to keep the \ncell functioning.  Over time this ATP deficiency can lead to the onset of symptoms like those seen \nin Friedreich&amp;#39;s ataxia.  In healthy mitochondria   a protein called frataxin plays an essential role in producing ATP and maintaining iron homeostasis. For patients with Friedreich&amp;#39;s ataxia the \namount of frataxin protein is too low. Frataxin deficiency not only lowers the amount of ATP produced but it can also cause a buildup of excess iron in the cell.   Too much iron can trigger reactive oxygen species also known as ROS that eventually cause oxidative \nstress resulting in damage to DNA  and essential proteins which can ultimately \ncause cells to stop functioning altogether. Because Friedreich&amp;#39;s ataxia is a multi-system \ndisease many tissue types can be affected, for example frataxin deficiency in cardiac \nand nervous tissue can cause symptoms of   cardiomyopathy and loss of muscle coordination.  But there is hope in gene therapy.  Gene therapy  is the process of adding genetic material directly \ninto cells through a non-infectious viral vector   to compensate for genes that are not working. For \nFriedreich&amp;#39;s ataxia patients gene therapy may be   used to deliver a functioning frataxin gene \ninto the nucleus of the target cells.  The new  frataxin gene without the mutation will generate frataxin protein for the mitochondria.  Gene therapy for Friedreich&amp;#39;s ataxia will likely not be a cure but rather a part of a patient&amp;#39;s treatment plan. Several gene therapy approaches may be needed to target the different affected cell types. And the degree of therapeutic impact will \npresumably depend on the stage of disease when gene therapy is administered. It is also important to note that there are outcome uncertainties with gene therapies, so clinical trials are needed \nto understand variability in treatment effects. Many researchers are actively working to \ndevelop gene therapy for Friedreich&amp;#39;s ataxia   they are collaborating with a larger community of other rare disease scientists, regulatory agencies   like the FDA, industry partners, patients, \nand the Friedrichs Ataxia Research Alliance   to share information and optimize gene therapy  approaches for Friedreich&amp;#39;s ataxia.  Please continue your education on gene therapy by viewing other modules in this series on the FARA website.",

    "transcript": "foreign I will introduce our presenter Dr David Lynch from Children&amp;#39;s Hospital of Philadelphia thank you Aaron today we&amp;#39;re going to be talking about new directions and pre-rex attacks our goal for today understanding free record taxia as well as the new things that are appearing in it not only the genetic basis but also some of the new treatments we&amp;#39;d like to be able to identify as a disease manifestation and understand the role of multiple disciplinary care in optimizing treatment management we also like to incorporate some reach advances in clinical studies into patient care and provide some guidance for those uh of you who will be new to uh the field and finally we&amp;#39;ll talk about some additional resources and tools that you can use to Aid in your care of people with prerequotaxia we&amp;#39;re starting with an overview and then I&amp;#39;m going to talk a little bit about the genetic etiology of Friedrich Ataxia and the mutations which give rise to it then we&amp;#39;ll talk a little bit about the clinical features of free record Taxi as well as the genetic testing which is now the mechanism we use to diagnose fa we&amp;#39;ll talk a little bit more about free Architects and clinical management and those things you can do for the multi-disciplinary uh care and the multiple systemic features of fa we&amp;#39;ll talk a little bit about omobolog slope the newly approved treatment for free record Ataxia which is reaching the market as we speak part of that will be the so-called Moxie studies the clinical trials which gave rise to the uh evidence in favor agreement with overlock so and finally we&amp;#39;ll talk a little bit more about the other research which is ongoing and freed architaxia as well as some of the other clinical trials as well as how to get access to these for your patients and access to more other knowledge for your patients okay crack ataxia is an awesome recessive Progressive hereditary disorder it could be classed as a progressive uh neurodegenerative movement disorder the results in gait and limb ataxia it&amp;#39;s caused by mutations in the fxn gene which colloquial goes by the name of the for taxing Gene which logically codes for the uh for tax approaching free record taxi is a rare disease affecting roughly one in fifty thousand people in the United States it&amp;#39;s more prevalent individuals of European ancestry and relatively uncommon in individuals of African or Asian descent it affects males and females equally we estimate they&amp;#39;re about 5 000 people in the United States although the actual number may be a few more than that or somewhat less than that typical fruit like your taxi will first present to a physician between the ages of 5 and 15. this counts for about 75 percent of all individuals other individuals are present between ages uh 15 and 20 and then we have a separate category called late on set free record taxi which has some subtle clinical uh features uh differences in clinical phenotype which developed after age 25. the age of onset is crucial in understanding how severe things will be the earlier your age of onset the more severe your disease will be typically people are wheelchair abound roughly 10 to 20 years after their initial symptoms life expectancy is shortened to fa reflecting the underlying cardiomyopathy that occurs in some individuals foreign from biolic expanded GAA nucleotide repeats in the non-coding intron one of the fratoxin gene this leads to decreased expression of the protein for toxin in this disease the RNA is uh is not the abnormal feature it&amp;#39;s the silencing of the gene by that GA repeat so all the businesses most likely occurs at the protein level protected as a mitochondrial protein which is implicated in a variety of mitochondrial functions regulation of the mitochondrial electron transport chain iron homeostasis and storage iron sulfur cluster uh formation you will recall from biochemistry that iron sulfur clusters are critical prosthetic Scoops and the enzymes of the credit cycle in the electron transport chain and for toxin also mediates some components of oxidative stress or better than its deficiency mediate some components of oxidative stress and 96 percent of patients Frederick Ataxia patients have two expanded triple repeats one on each for tax and allele uh in four percent of in the individuals patients are compound heterozygous for a ga expansion on one allele and either a point mutation or a deletion on the other those point mutations or insertions or deletions are associated with loss of function so those point mutations also basically knock down the fratoxin protein expression so for Friedrich attacks can be looked at as a for attacks and knock down not a complete absence but a for tax and knockdown in normal for tax and alleles there are five exons uh and the expansion has fewer than 30 repeats most people have only seven repeats in their uh day expansion between X on one and X on code longer expansions here typically beginning about 30 but clinically the shortest ones tend to be about 60 and going up to 1500 repeats they uh decrease the expression of the protein and the longer the repeat the increased severity of the disease it&amp;#39;s important to realize that it expands and decreased facts and expression but not completely eliminated and people with point mutations diagrams here is those for example with l106x a nonsense mutation or submissive mutations you make for toxin but it&amp;#39;s either unstable and doesn&amp;#39;t fold correctly or uh or it is non-functional in the case of several others what happens in fried OK taxi neurologically you see degeneration of a variety of neurological systems but they&amp;#39;re primarily three that we talk about most importantly the large fibrous Sensory neurons particularly proprioception and Vibe reception vibratory sensation cerebellar coordination is affected with the generation of the cerebellum in particular and the corticospinal motor system is affected leading to eventual weakness as well as spasticity this of course gives rise to a series of neurological abnormalities Progressive gait and limit taxi mainly reflecting degeneration of the cerebellum and it&amp;#39;s uh efferent pathways the binsky signs which are found early representing the cortical spinal Tech degeneration loss of balance and Associated loss of vibration impaired proprioception which we believe to occur very early usually before we ever meet people and be relatively static over the course of the disease so it&amp;#39;s not really a component which is leading to progression it&amp;#39;s degenerationism and finally just Demetria difficulty coordination of the hands and using your hands there&amp;#39;s some other abnormalities uh in the neurological features hearing loss which is a unique type of hearing loss where people are still able to hear but they cannot discriminate where sounds are coming from in a crowded room thus that will hear primary tones abnormally but their functional hearing will be quite impaired loss of deep tendon reflexes again usually present when we first meet people refracting loss of proprioception dysarthria but not Aphasia so miss our articulation of speech but no difficulties in language itself oculomotor abnormalities as you might see with cerebellar disease but they are in quite subtle MFA you see very little nystagmus it&amp;#39;s usually limited to psychotic macro oscillations and square wave jerks uh with fixation instability much more subtle things than you see in autosomal dominating taxis vision loss use your refracting Progressive optic neuropathy this is one of the most feared complications of fa and can happen in 10 to 20 percent of people particularly Those Who present at a young age less than 10. and finally dysphagia difficulty swollen I would say overall surprisingly dysphagia is not as big a clinical complaint as it uh one would expect it to be these all reflect the neuroanatomic abnormalities seen in fa uh as diagram there moving on to the next Slide the non-neurologic features which are in some ways uh more concerning particularly for mortality cardiac dysfunction the primary cardiac dysfunction is uh a cardiomyopathy which leads to thickening of the heart early but later fibrosis of the heart with loss of systolic function and load injection fraction this is the most common cause of death in people in FA and when people have cardiomyopathy about 50 percent of individuals they die in their 20s or 30s in most cases the second aspect of the cardiomyopathy beyond the heart failure from systolic dysfunction is arrhythmias usually the eurythmias of Freedom attacks here are atrial in origin until late they are a nuisance but they can be controlled by ablation or rape control beta blockers and others associated methods atrial fibrillation is probably the most common arrhythmia and fa they&amp;#39;re also Orthopedic issues scoliosis which occurs in roughly 60 percent of patients but requires surgical correction in a lesser amount perhaps 20 percent those 20 are typically the people who present early in the first decade of life there&amp;#39;s also a loss of bone mineral density in FA and people with fa do really have thin bones this may be a part of their overall small stature but this can precede the difficulties in ambulation so it is important to know about and to potentially treat other aspects of fa outside the nervous system include diabetes with roughly 10 to 20 percent of people having Frank diabetes at a much larger number having impaired insulin resistance diabetes and FAA can be both type 1 from insulin lack from failure beta cells to develop or type 2 from increased insulin resistance you see increased urinary frequency and urgency rarely incontinence usually the urinary urgency is relatively well controlled with medications you also see a slight change in height in BMI in people with fa rarely is it so severe that uh children are diagnosed with failures to thrive or demand independent workups and finally perhaps under appreciated is the presence of sleep disorders in FA particularly sleep apnea which can be up to 20 of people with fa and can be a quite serious uh disorder in FA and have a major effect on uh uh day-to-day life how do you identify a free decade taxi clinically it&amp;#39;s apparent by people presenting at the right time between agent 5 and 15 with decreased reflexes Ataxia usually an MRI scan which is normal however that&amp;#39;s not how we diagnose it with certainty in the modern era genetic testing is the way we confirm fa in uh the real world and it is required for really having the diagnosis the test to send available in a variety of labs around the United States is GAA repeat expansion testing not DNA sequence for sequencing for mutations and for taxing GA repeat expansion looks for that expanded allele which is found in 96 percent of patients with fa I should say which is 96 percent of abnormal alleles and virtually everyone everyone except the single person of the world has at least one expanded gear would feed if you find only one expanded Jr repeat then you can look to find the second one using DNA sequencing it will find the four percent of abnormal alleles so do not do sequencing first or you have negative results and 96 percent of people I will note uh sequencing will pick up essentially all of those uh remaining four percent genetic testing is available many Laboratories not all of them provide the exact repeat link age of onset is the best predictor of phenotype but knowing the ga repeat length exactly is sometimes helpful in differentiating some of the features of fa from uh coexistent coincidental diseases so I would say G repeat sizing is helpful if you can get it but uh that&amp;#39;s not always available for the modern world but remember and this is important because I&amp;#39;ve seen people who have gotten the sequencing first get the expansion testing first we have a patient with fa in your office what can you do well until March 1st of this year the therapeutic options were limited Rehabilitation was the Mainstay Physical Therapy occupational therapy as well as speech therapy later in the disease also an important aspect is the multidisciplinary care exchange specials cardiologists to manage the symptoms as they come along though there is nothing to necessarily prevent the progression of cardiac disease neurologists to monitor symptoms and monitor for neuropathic pain and spasticity orthopedic surgeons particularly during the era time up to age 16 or 18 when children are still growing and they may need intervention on their scoliosis to some degree uh neuro-ophthalmology or Ophthalmology so that one corrects all the visual issues that are correctable outside of uh the Epic neuropathy of fa occasionally a urologist if a person&amp;#39;s urinary frequency is particularly intractable to standard anticholinergic medicines and finally sleep physicians in those cases where people have bad Sleep Disorders which reinforce the fatigue of the disease so you&amp;#39;re monitoring their neurological features the muscle skeletal features they&amp;#39;re cardiac features with testing for EKGs and Echoes every year MRI if it&amp;#39;s available endocrine monitoring for diabetes looking at hemoglobin a1cs testing people&amp;#39;s Vision be sure that no other causes are coming up and finally auditory assessments to assess the issues which might be appearing in hearing so now on March 1st everything changed we now have an FDA approved approved treatment called omovolox alone for free drug Ataxia and individuals 16 and older this was based on two separate studies that we&amp;#39;ll go through in more detail first the part the study overall was called Moxie this was part two part one was a dose finding study which took two years to find the optimum dose and was a critical part of things but in part two it was a double blind multi-site placebo-controlled trial which demonstrated benefit the second part which the FDA was uh appropriately quite insisted on was an analysis of the extension data when everyone continued on Homo velox Alone after that to be sure that individuals the benefit remained as well as comparison to Natural History data to show that this might be useful in a more general population the approval is for individuals 16 and older that mainly reflects because those are the individuals who are involved in the original study and there&amp;#39;s officially no safety data for individuals under age 16. I think it&amp;#39;s logical to predict that some some of those things will be some some studies of that age group will appear in the future work it&amp;#39;s a little unclear it has multiple actions its main activity though is it&amp;#39;s a small molecule that activates the transcription factor in rf2 the Nrf2 is a transcription factor that protects all our cells from oxidative stress damage by regulating the expression of so-called antioxidant element containing genes those enzymes which we turn on to keep ourselves from being damaged by free radicals in Friedrich Ataxia for some reason which we do not understand signaling is paradoxically depressed and mitochondrial functions are down regulated and we don&amp;#39;t make enough of those antioxidant response element genes that they ought to be making in FA this is all Downstream from the deficiency for tax and protein which is governing the disease but I will note Nrf2 itself does not increase protection levels it is acting Downstream from the initial loss of protection so the objective of the study particularly uh the uh part two study which assess the safety and efficacy of omovaloxone and Friedrich ataxi patients 16 to 40 in a rigorous manner the design it was double blind placebo-controlled randomized total number of individuals of 103 in sites in the United States Australia and Europe participants were between 60 and 40 years of age they had to have genetically confirmed feedback and taxi and in this study they did allow individuals who carried a point mutation so that four percent with slightly atypical disease the key things people had to be is their infrar score the score which is a Quantified neurological exam which grades the severity of the ataxi phenotype had to be between 20 and 80 20 as a person very near presentation 80 is a person very late stage and I will mention that no one was higher than about 57 with the study they also had to be able to complete maximal exercise testing that is be able to ride a recumbent bike against no resistance for three minutes at a Cadence of about 50 revolutions per minute that was used because exercise testing trying to look at the skeletal muscle effects for toxic deficiency was a secondary outcome water solution criteria you couldn&amp;#39;t have significant heart disease so as we talk about this you can&amp;#39;t make any conclusion about the effect of omovaloxylone on the heart from a basic science point of view omav ought to be helpful for the heart but there is no data to uh reinforce that or negate that the primary endpoint with the change in that infrar scale a Quantified neurologic exam scale compared with Placebo at 48 weeks basically one year along with safety say a substance including Vital Signs electrocardiograms and Adverse Events along with physical exams uh as you see on this slide looking here in Gray the placebo arm this is the active drug arm gown is Improvement on the Empire so it&amp;#39;s a net lower score over time what you see in the placebo arm is for the first three months you see a mild fever response and then you see people working over time interestingly slope of this line here is almost identical to that scene in Natural History studies a group of people response response and then progression at the expected rate in contrast with omav homophobic you see the response in three months and then it persists and it actually will persist longer than these 48 weeks of human Republican side so the end of this time the total difference between the two uh groups it&amp;#39;s about 2.5 Empire units so you say well what&amp;#39;s 2.5 M5 units the most important thing to know is that a person in this cohort would have been expected to change around 1.5 Empires units per year and I think you can see that as you look at what the natural history of progression these three quarters every year is about one is 0.96 units somewhere between 1.3 to 1.5 units per year is the expected progression so the difference at the end of this the equivalent to 1.5 to 2 years of progression that&amp;#39;s something that patients would tell you is clinically meaningful also think not so much about the two-point difference here but about the area of difference between the curve which really tells you how much benefit patients uh have it&amp;#39;s time dependent and I will note through all the different composed of its Empire&amp;#39;s neurological exam all groups all subsections benefited and I would all note also all subgroups within the study showed benefit so whether you presented earlier or later every subgroup showed benefit diverse event rates were basically pretty low there were no minimally different between the omav and Placebo groups it&amp;#39;s basically well tolerated very mild uh Adverse Events a few people with headache nausea asymptomatology from fatigue and occasional abdominal pain they do have that does lead to an increase in transaminases without any liver injury this is thought to be a reactivation of the liver not a Toxic Event if people if you follow these through people go up to in typically 1.5 to 2 times normal and then they return to normal it&amp;#39;s time dependent occurs several months after the onset and abates on its own if if one stops the drug it abates faster and some individuals went off and then were re-challenged without any future issues then there&amp;#39;s a second part of the analysis the so-called delayed start analysis of the extension studies so hear what you&amp;#39;re doing you&amp;#39;ve shown in that first single year that individuals who go on Moxie on omap better about one and a half to two years better the question is is that maintained and what you&amp;#39;re looking for in a delayed start is you&amp;#39;re looking to see if people who start in the extension study start active drug do they ever catch up to the people who started right at the beginning if they do catch up that argues that it&amp;#39;s a symptomatic benefit it doesn&amp;#39;t change the fact it&amp;#39;s a benefit but it argues it&amp;#39;s a symptomatic benefit the primary endpoint being judged about a year and a half down the road it took on non-inferiority are the two the difference between people from the original placebo group and the omap group maintained at 72 weeks and is the change in the omav and placebo group similar over time once you start the extension analysis this is the wonderfully complex diagram of a delayed start study which is one of the more detailed uh mechanisms of analysis and one of the more confusing ones this here at the beginning is all the primary part of part two people go off amoxic eventually and then you want to see if this different ear is maintained over time as you look out here and you look at this difference here as you follow them along you find that out here it is maintained it actually even grows a little bit though that&amp;#39;s not statistically significance so the delayed start analysis is positive because you&amp;#39;re different here is maintained here if you started on Placebo you never catch up once you go onto omap so that is consistent with a uh endurance of the beneficial effect what sometimes is called uh disease modifying effect although I hate that terminology some noise in the middle here I will note this point here uh had a relatively lower number of uh people participating because that was right at the beginning of covad covid showing how covid did influence some of the clinical trials we were doing so this is a second component showing the benefit of moxie you can do one more thing my good friends with the free architecture research of wives have sponsored a natural history study in free direct tax year which I&amp;#39;m actually the pi of it began in 2002 so we now have accrued data of 20 years on individuals you can take those individuals and pull out a matched set and compare them to people in the clinical trial now this so-called propensity matching which can calculate a goodness of fit and how well you have fit the data based on Aid agent onset sex based on an exam score you can show that you can create an excellent match and when you do that going through three years of follow-up beyond the double-blind study so you&amp;#39;re all the way out to four years on omap it still slowed the disease in years one through four by 55 compared to Natural History data so this is another way to analyze uh extension data which again shows the benefit of homo veloxville based on all these things three things together that&amp;#39;s what brought the FBA to approve uh the drug for people with fa 16 and older now this isn&amp;#39;t the only thing which is being examined in free bracket taxi and that&amp;#39;s why identification is still important and we still have work to do Alma volox alone is a good drug probably a very good drug but it is not a cure as this is the so-called Frederick treatment pipeline uh used as uh given to us with uh by the freedom Factor research allowance for use here spy Claris is the brand name of homo volaxon but I&amp;#39;ll tend to obviously use the generic there are lots of different things that we&amp;#39;re looking at regular taxi to try and find more treatment to add on top of omf improving mitochondrial function modulation of Downstream events stabilizing the protection which is there increasing the expression of taxes by creating the gene with turned off back on and finally putting in new protecting gene therapy or editing the gene to cut out the ga repeat see as you go right here that diagram to where things are in clinical trials you see Sky clearance having crossed the fence line but you see other drugs were known in these three studies that will be read read out soon some drug uh in phase two studies and then others going through phase one and all the way back to still in development thus there are lots of things still going on so if you know people with free direct taxi who like to participate in studies please let us know and we&amp;#39;d be happy to try and bring them to the sites so if you&amp;#39;ve met some new people with free like a taxi and I suspect now that we have a treatment you will people will come out of the woodwork people who were lost to follow up because they didn&amp;#39;t know they noted that there was no clinical trial you may need to find some new some resources there are a variety of around uh just published uh online and uh in print through orphanet is the clinical management guidelines of free direct detective a collaborative effort across many of the expert in disease where simple situations and management of non-fa problems as well as fa problems are diagrammed out selected drugs uh when to panic when not to panic that&amp;#39;s always a useful thing to know uh in addition YouTube I will refer you uh for research centers of the creek Ataxia Network Alliance soon we&amp;#39;ll call it something else we&amp;#39;ll call it the global chemical Consortium because we&amp;#39;re merging with the uh European group this is sponsored by the Freedom Tax and research Alliance where we run our natural history study but the patients get the privilege of seeing experts in disease who have seen more than just a few patients with fa and finally a lot of your patients uh will be interested in getting access to omav there&amp;#39;s an online site called The Reach uh start form that you can go to get the start form which actually is a prescription to help them start getting their own up I will note if anyone has questions about prescribing owner of their welcome to email me at any time so it&amp;#39;s truly a new era in FA at this point and I think we have a lot of excitement and it&amp;#39;s hopefully we&amp;#39;ll carry this excitement through to find some more treatments in the upcoming years and with that I&amp;#39;d like to thank you all for your

John do say is dean of science and technology at Nicholls State University and a professor of human and environmental genetics he says that Gracie&amp;#39;s condition is due to a mutation of one of 20 to 25,000 genes in her body a gene is a sequence of instruction in a person&amp;#39;s DNA that determines inherited traits every person has two copies of each gene one inherited from each parent when some of that DNA is mutated of course genetics focuses on the mutation to try to identify it to try to ameliorate or ameliorate it and to try to help improve the health of individuals that might have that mutation making that task somewhat easier is the fact that Friedreich&amp;#39;s ataxia or FA is more prevalent among Cajuns Cajuns are an example of what geneticists call a founder population individuals separated from a larger group now sharing a smaller gene pool generations of intermarriage among Akkadian descendants has caused FA and other genetic conditions to be more prevalent within their community for researchers trying to trace gene changes this is significant now we know that all these individuals are related so they must or chances are they have the same mutation and we can identify it with that power we can also identify where on each long piece of DNA called a chromosome that mutation exists in the 1990s mutations and the fruit taxon gene were identified as the underlying cause of FA which opened the door to developing treatments just last year clinical trials of a new drug demonstrated significant improvement in neurological function in fa patients it&amp;#39;s called oh ma the locks alone its limits the progression of FA the drug is going through the FDA approval process and Gracie hopes it will be distributed soon currently a senior at South Lafourche High School Gracie continues to be proactive in her health care and planning for her future I stay positive through exercise exercise is known to slow the progression down it gives me hope that whenever treatment does come I&amp;#39;m still gonna have some mobility and speech today she&amp;#39;s uh planning on going to college that&amp;#39;s gonna be her next challenge in life going off to on her own and seeing how college life is and to become independent",

receive an overview of friderex ataxia and learn about fa&amp;#39;s clinical research landscape now i would like to introduce our speaker dr subramony directs the adult muscular dystrophy clinics at ataxia clinic at the university of florida health in gainesville florida and with that i would like to turn over the webinar to dr super money so i want to thank you very much and in particular i want to thank the families and patients who are on the webinar uh listening to me for a while like always you know i i like to start with a little bit of history uh and uh this is uh uh obviously still an evolving field and the field is still making history but remember that you have this disease was originally identified and figured out as a distinct disease by nicolas friedrich a german physician between the years 1860 and 1876 he was the first one to point out that ataxias in these young children and young adults could have a genetic basis so we we started talking about nicolas friedrich and his description of fredrik&amp;#39;s attacks in the 1860s and over the next 100 years we struggle with this disease how to distinguish it from many other types of ataxia because it turns out there are large different large numbers of inherited ataxias and in the 1970s and 1980s two um stalwart figures got into the act and you see a picture of professor andre barber from montreal and then professor anita harding from london and both of these people worked on large families of free drugs from canada and from london england and were able to refine the clinical diagnosis of friedreich&amp;#39;s taxi and this was quite important because that allowed to sample very clear definite diagnosis of free drugs patients and we needed that uh to combine that with the dna technology which was emerging at that time and finally able to identify the causative mutation in free director text years so now we all know and many of many of you already know that this mutation was published in 1996 and it is a unusual type of mutation we call a repeat expansion and it is a ga repeat expansion in in free frederick&amp;#39;s atexia and so on the right side here if you can see my cursor i give you a little cartoon of a gene uh if for example a gene is made up of the the string of nucleotide molecules are actually four molecules that make up the gene in terms of its core it&amp;#39;s got a promoter sequence and it&amp;#39;s got these blue segments which are called exons these are responsible for making proteins whereas the introns are not they kind of are kind of in between filler dna if you will it&amp;#39;s converted into an rna and in the case of friedreich&amp;#39;s atexia there&amp;#39;s this repetitive series of nucleotides g-a-a-g-a on and on so if you have a normal number of these repetitions you don&amp;#39;t have any problem but when it expands and becomes longer you get the disease so can i have the next slide please so everybody is familiar with what this disease does it causes increasing balance problems speech problems coordinator coordination problems uh beginning usually in teenage years sometimes later um and then it causes some skeletal muscle deformities i mean sorry skeletal deformities like scoliosis uh it affects the heart um it affects the cerebellum up here as you can see it also affects these nerves the peripheral nerves so they have a neuropathy and all of this causes the atexia because they can get a cardiomyopathy it often affects the pancreas can i have the next slide please so we know that this is a recessive disease so what do we mean by that uh every gene that you have comes in two copies you have a paternal copy and a metallocopy and in the case of a recessive disease you really need both copies to be mutated the parents are carriers and they won&amp;#39;t get the disease and in the case of friedreich&amp;#39;s ataxia again here i show you this first intron of the free drugs gene you have a repeat called gaa these are repetitive nucleotides that are strung together like beads uh and up to about 44 repeats will be quite normal so normal individuals will have fewer than 44 repeats in both ldls but when you get both alleles beyond 44 repeats usually 66 or more you get the disease for example here you have 500 repeats in this intron that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s what causes the disease and this number is unstable so if you count this number in different patients with three drugs of taxi it&amp;#39;s going to be a little bit different so as it gets transmitted the number does change and we know now that what this does is to reduce the copying of this dna into rna so it causes problems with what we call transcription which is done by an enzyme called rna polymerase so if not enough of the messenger rna is made and the result is there is not enough of fratexian so you see here on the left side normal amount of retexan in friedreich&amp;#39;s patients there is reduced amount of retexan and we know that this is what causes the disease this is the ultimate cause of the disease next slide please so there are a number of questions that we need to answer and we have been addressing for the last 25 30 years first of all how does the gaa expansion cost uh the reduced amount of retexan what is it about that long gi repeat that does not allow for enough production of the rna in enough production of the protection protein and the second question is how does the reduced amount of retection cost pathology and clinical symptoms and finally the most important question is what can we do to correct protection deficiency and its consequences so can i have the next slide please so um like everything in medicine and with corbin news all the time on tv people realize that things are quite complex in human biology also in any kind of biology things are quite complex so you never say that your knowledge is complete but this is what we understand so far and i&amp;#39;m sure that knowledge is going to continue to evolve one of the things people realize very early on that when the ga repeat becomes longer than normal the dna in which it is sitting starts behaving in funny ways uh instead of doing a double helix it often makes what we call triplexes and sticky dna so that just like a long thread of a long string of thread which can get tangled upon itself so that&amp;#39;s what happens at the dna level we think that this may have consequences because it may stall that polymerase enzyme not allow enough rna to be produced in addition to that there is a considerable amount of evidence that it causes what we call epigenetics now what is that what does that word mean it means this that you know all our genes are tightly regulated they can come on and off so if you go to this figure on the bottom right corner genes can have a green signal where the genes are working and making their protein they can be regulated and go to the red side where you can have gene silencing so this happens all the time in response to all the stimuli we get and there are a number of ways the genes are regulated even in normal normal people and one of the regulatory mechanisms involves a protein which is shown in a cartoon here called histones there are lots of histones that cluster around genes and if a gene is working normally the histones are open so they&amp;#39;re kind of surrounding the promoter area of the gene but but the configuration of these histones is quite open and this openness is often related to these little orange things that we call acetyl molecules that are attached to the histone these are called acetyl tails so an acetylation of these proteins allows for an open configuration of the gene and the gene is active but from time to time these histones can lose these tails and become clustered from what we call heterochromatin this is a close configuration of not available a formation of histone that&amp;#39;s not permissive for gene activation gene gets silenced there are many other mechanisms as well including additional methyl molecules to the histones and methylation of the the dna itself and all these are still being explored but the the the acetyl citration of histone story is the best explored in terms of why this gene gets silenced i can have the next slide please so so we we have some idea uh why we don&amp;#39;t we don&amp;#39;t make enough ritexan when when you have the mutation the gaa expansion and you also have a fair amount of idea what happens to the cells if you don&amp;#39;t have enough retexan so here on the left side you have a complex picture of a fratexin molecule so these proteins are configured in different ways there&amp;#39;s a helical formation that are what we call beta sheets and this all kind of the this configuration of the protein is very important for its function we know that the gene for free rights protection sits in the nucleus of the cells and then the protein is made in what we call the cytoplasm but we also know that this protein protection is targeted to these little thingies looking like little regular tracks these are called mitochondria so fratexin the major function of the fatexin is in the mitochondria and what are mitochondria so here is a blow up of what a mitochondria might look like and what i&amp;#39;m going to show you here is i call this the furnace of the cell because we need a lot of energy to do everything we do in our in our body every day moving speaking thinking even resting requires energy even sleeping requires energy and that energy is made from the glucose that you eat from the fat fats and fatty acids that you put in your system they eventually end up within the mitochondria and there is this complex biochemical cycle that&amp;#39;s called a tca cycle which burns up the glucose you see the carbon dioxide being produced oxygen is used here and this tca cycle is important in producing the energy as also the oxidation of fatty acids which we call beta oxidation so there are a couple of these metabolic cycles that are going within the mitochondria and this feeds into a complex series of proteins that are stuck inside the mitochondrial membrane these are called the electron transport chains so this is a very complicated process of oxidizing fatty acids oxidizing carbohydrates generating hydrogen and other kinds of ions combining it with oxygen and the final product is this important energy molecule called atp so this is what happens in mitochondria now what happens with freight rise we mentioned that protection is targeted mitochondria and the most important function that we have identified for fratexion is shown here and fratexin is important in handling iron the ion that we all know about the metal ion and it it handles the ion within the mitochondria to make a series of complex molecules called iron sulfur clusters iscs and what are these clusters these clusters are proteins that need to be inserted into many enzymes that are in the in the cycle for example that also also proteins that are inserted into this electron transport chain so the result of a lack of protection number one is there is reduction in the isc clusters which will translate into a reduction of the tca cycle so the furnace is not working well it also causes problems in the electron transport chain again the atp production there is energy failure in these cells which causes the cell death at the same time because iron is not being utilized you get iron overload overloading the mitochondria so the iron is not used and finally if these pathways are are not working well the oxygen that is being supplied here will often form what we call reactive oxygen species or oxidative stress which is a word which is familiar to many people and when you have a problem with the electron transport chain you generate a lot more oxidative stress and reactive oxygen species than normally so there is increased oxidative stress there is energy failure and curiously enough we also find that the cells normally pull out a defense mechanism against oxidative stress but in frederick&amp;#39;s atexia this oxidative stress uh defense mechanisms are impaired can i have the next slide please so this is kind of a summary so you have the gaa expansion leads to silencing the fratexin gene not enough protection is produced when that happens not enough iron sulfur clusters are synthesized the enzymes that use these ion sulfur clusters are deficient these enzymes are important for electron transport they&amp;#39;re important for burning up carbohydrates and lipids this results in energy failure and this energy failure of course is not good for your neurons and cells which are affected in free draxotaxia and the impaired electron transport generates oxidative stress and the excess iron also generates oxidative stress at the same time there seems to be an abnormality of oxidative defense mechanism and we&amp;#39;ll come back to that in just a few minutes can i have the next slide please so having understood all that we can conceptualize that way we can try and treat freedox atexia and i i kind of classify the approaches into two types one is what i call targeting the downstream pathways the oxidative stress and similar mechanisms we can reduce the oxidative stress we can improve the oxidative defense mechanisms try to get rid of the excess iron which may be responsible for some of the oxidative stress so these are some of the downstream strategies that have already been tried in frederick&amp;#39;s atexia still being tried but we can also go to the very source of the problem we can replace the gene that would clearly be very effective if we can do it well now everybody has heard of the capability of gene editing enzymes like crispr cache can be used potentially this is still being developed we know much about the epigenetics and other ways that the genes and maybe we have a way to reactivate the genes by influencing these mechanisms we can replace the protein and so on and so forth i do believe that going to the source and finding an effective therapy in this area is going to be more effective than targeting a downstream pathway can i go to the next slide please but i will talk a little about what has happened in the downstream pathways because uh many of these trials came up quite early in frederick&amp;#39;s attacks here simply because the molecules that can target these oxidative stress for example are uh we already knew about many of these molecules many of them are nutri nutrient supplements uh they are drugs that are already available in the market so many trials were done for example if you look at this picture here here&amp;#39;s the mitochondria these pink dots are the excessive ion because this ion is not being used here is the electron transport chain uh problems giving rise to ros and energy failure drugs like coins and q10 idibin on are able to kind of help this energy process here and maybe reduce the oxidative stress you can chelate the iron for example using deferred prone there are these molecules that have been tried that are called ros scavengers which are able to kind of mop up uh these toxic oxygen molecules and try to help the oxidative stress and finally the oxidative defense mechanisms it turns out that in freedox atexia we have identified two pathways that protect the cells against oxidative stress and these pathways basically what they do for example is one is called the pgc one alpha ppa or gamma pathway so when the cell is exposed to oxidative stress these pathways get activated because the cells have fantastic mechanisms for protecting themselves so this pathway for example when it is activated it increases mitochondrial biogenesis it makes more mitochondria the nrf2 pathway on the other hand when uh in response to oxidative stress will activate certain genes and these genes will make antioxidant proteins like glutathione within the cells so these are all mechanisms that have been uh worked out in three blocks athexia can have the next slide please so the earlier trials infringe atexia beginning in the 1990s primarily involved in early 2000 involved antioxidant strategies for example coq10 was tried in a fairly small number of studies did not have a neurological effect now coq10 is not absorbed very well it does not enter the brain very well so a lot of problems with this drug but it was tried because it was so easily available most people believe that this does not cause a whole lot of side effects uh as many of you know ibn was [Music] given to large numbers of patients about 500 patients in different studies the largest experience of antioxidant was with ibn it is a kokitan analog but it is smaller in size it&amp;#39;s absorbed better it probably has a better function within the mitochondria than coq10 does but the results of these large-scale studies uh were conflicting uh many of these studies or all trials usually identify a primary outcome measure this is what we&amp;#39;re going to do with the trial and in all of these trials we noticed that the primary outcome measure was not met it was not satisfied and none of the regulatory agencies are proved i depend on for free drugs atexia a couple of other drugs this is a small study where again the primary outcome measure was not met and there has been an open label study of vitamin b1 thymine which seems to help this energetic process within the mitochondria the sarah score is a measure of neurological function it is a neurological examination score many of you who participate in research often get these measurements done by a neurologist either status core or m fars or farce examination uh can i have the next slide please as you can see there are a couple of these ros scavengers uh and as you notice these are kind of uh nutritional sort of products uh egb761 is derived from gingko biloba and this seems to be a product of got microbes again a very little benefit was derived from these from these small studies um can i have the next slide please so um one of the things that we know is that when you have oxygen toxicity so-called reactive oxygen species and oxidative stress this can damage many things in cells it can damage proteins it can damage nucleic acids it can damage lipids and one of the strategies that is now being done in a trial is to protect a lipid peroxidation can we at least protect the lipids so lipids which are which you get from your fat in your diet and synthesized in the cells of course are very important for maintaining the cell wall and all kinds of other functions and it turns out that if you take a fatty acid like linoleic acid and replace the hydrogen with an isotope called deuterium so deuterium is basically hydrogen with a different number of electrons if i remember right so so if you change it into deuterium it is it seems to protect against lipid peroxidation so that&amp;#39;s the basis of this trial uh it&amp;#39;s called rt001 uh done by a pharmaceutical company called retrostrobe and this trial is ongoing as you see we anticipate recruiting 60 subjects the recruitment is almost finished you have a two arms one is a placebo arm the other is a treated arm and these patients are going to be followed for almost a year and the primary outcome that we are looking at is cardiopulmonary exercise test which is a bike test where we measure oxygen and workload and carbon dioxide and so on and so forth but we&amp;#39;ll be looking at neurological function and all the other things that we often look at you know activities are daily living scores so this trial is still ongoing uh but many of the other antioxidant strategies have been tried and kind of had somewhat very mixed results not enough to provide approval can i have the next slide please i want to come back come to uh most exciting news and that is so as i mentioned before these are downstream pathways and to some extent i&amp;#39;m not very surprised that when you target downstream pathways the effect is not very much neurological diseases are quite difficult you know their lungs they&amp;#39;re very chronic they damage the nervous system so it needs to be these are difficult diseases to treat but um the strategy that people are now thinking about is to enhance the defense against oxidative stress and we mentioned two pathways that the cell uses one is called the ppa or gamma pathway which increases mitochondrial biogenesis it increases the amount of mitochondria that you that you get so you know this is the ppa or gamma pathway so when something happens in the cell this the reactive oxygen species build up and this pathway goes in and starts making more mitochondria and one of the trials that is going on is uh using a drug called larry gletason also called min102 this is an early phase trial i don&amp;#39;t have too much details uh the the the safety of this compound is being established in the trial in europe uh and i hear good things about it so we&amp;#39;ll see what happens with this trial with larry glitters on but still driving at a downstream pathway on this side of the ocean we&amp;#39;ve had strategies to activate the nrf2 pathway and resveratrol is one compound which is in a small study uh but i want to talk about the study with a drug called alexander rta408 can i go to the next slide please so um rta408 is a activator an rf2 and so since there is a problem with the nrf2 activation and free blocks atexia a number of pre-clinical studies were done looking at what this compound does uh to free direct circum models and cell systems and i just gave you an example of one of these studies done in london and what this shows are these are two different mouse models of friedreich&amp;#39;s atexia these are patient cells and this nadh pool that you see here this is this is a measure of the atp energy production here and what you see in these mouse models is a reduction in the energy production in the nadh pool and when you treat it with umau it gets back to near normal as you can see this is another model a different model and you see the same thing and these are patient cells normal cells again a pheromone of nadh pool this is reduced by more than fifty percent in patient cells it gets even worse if you expose it to hydrogen peroxide but when you give it all off it tends to get better now one of the things that is not shown in this slide when you do these bench work experiments when you give homo increasing doses you get a better and better effect but after a certain dose if you increase those further it actually goes back it it kind of the effect goes away and you you actually do not get the positive effect if you go beyond a certain dose so that is this funny looking dose response curve with a mouth because of the results of the omaha in preclinical studies it&amp;#39;s we started with a an initial trial which was a dose-ranging trial uh uh basically trying to figure out the dose of a mouth and there were a total of 48 patients so it&amp;#39;s a very pretty small trial they were divided into placebo group as well as treated group the treated group as you can see had ascending doses 5 40 80 160 300 milligrams per day of their mouth and what this picture here shows if you can see my cursor is a measurement of a liver enzyme called ggt in serum and it turns out that this if you activate the nrf2 pathway it turns on the gene for ggt in the liver and the ggt level goes up and you see what happens with increasing doses of amount you get an increasing level of ggt in the blood and then when you get it at 300 just like in the bench works experiments the level falls off and in parallel with this what you see here is uh what we call the m4 score this is a neurological score of severity of disease the trial lasts at 12 weeks and you see multiple doses and what you find is that the 160 milligram dose had the best effect uh as you can see it produced a significant difference from the placebo group it is interesting to note actually to go back the m4 score increases with increasing severity of neurological illness but it decreases with the improvement in neurological illness and interestingly as you see there is a placebo effect even the patients who are not treated with the omaha had some improvement over 12 weeks but the improvement was much more than the 160 milligram age group and less so in the 80 milligram age group and this is another plot which also shows that when you get it at 300 milligrams the effect goes away so this is the best improvement at 160 milligrams per day in a short trial in a small number of subjects can i have the next slide please so based on that experience uh it was decided to do a large-scale double-blind placebo-controlled study of course this was organized by riata the pharmaceutical company patients were divided into two groups the placebo arm the omaf the dose picked was 150 milligram based on the part one study and the patients were followed for a longer period of time after 48 weeks and this these results have been just published can i go to the next slide please uh so what i&amp;#39;m showing you is the important result the primary outcome measure for this study was actually the m4 score and that&amp;#39;s what you see right here and again to remind you if the m4 scores gets lower the patient is doing better from a neurological perspective if it gets higher it is worsening so so this is the baseline and what you see here is both the groups placebo as well as drug group declined for about 12 weeks this clearly again is a placebo response as we saw with the first study but then they start differing from each other as you can see you can see the placebo arm starts worsening and at the end of the study they were about 1.55 points worse than the baseline uh and you can see uh the the treated arm was much better so for a total difference of about 2.4 points that&amp;#39;s a statistically significant so there was a statistically significant um improvement in the m force code of the treated arm compared to the placebo arm and they show some more details of this oops these are all the subjects uh if you if you see uh what you see here is that we have learned from the first phase of the trial that uh patients who have foot deformity often do not do as well as patients who do not have a food deformity as you can see here these are patients who did not have a foot deformity like a high arch foot and this these are the ones of the foot deformity children or 20 of these children they study did a whole lot better than the entire group if you will so children seem to have better effects so this shows the result just in children this is seven children who got the placebo and these are 13 children who got the drug and you see that there&amp;#39;s even bigger difference than in the whole group and so this is the first positive result if you will in a double blind trial with friedreich&amp;#39;s atexia can i have the next slide please and some more details i don&amp;#39;t want to go into the details of it but you can see that many other things include as well the clinical impression of the patient the clinician&amp;#39;s impression of the patient during the trial the timed walk test improved the frequency of falls improved and we also did activities of daily living so we score items like speech and bathing and dressing personal hygiene and and so forth and you can see that in all of these there is a decline in score and of course this means improvement so it is not just the total mfr scores several items that we were measuring were better on the rta 408 or maf can i have the next slide please um i will not belabor this slide too much so we are very excited about the rta408 i hear that uh riata is uh uh looking at these results probably talking to fda and we&amp;#39;ll not wait and see uh if we hear any more news on this um so we&amp;#39;ll we&amp;#39;ll see what happens now um people have thought about handling iron and chelating iron out and this has not really worked the the way the cells handle an iron in friedreich&amp;#39;s effect is quite complex this again showing your cell this is mitochondria you got this iron excess sitting here because it&amp;#39;s not being used to make the iron sulfur cluster proteins and interestingly enough the mitochondria tell the cell hey we don&amp;#39;t uh we&amp;#39;re not making the iron sulfur cluster and the cell thinks that it needs more ions so it&amp;#39;s not pulling in more iron so it&amp;#39;s kind of a vicious cycle and in fact there&amp;#39;s excess iron coming in from the from the blood into the cell even though there&amp;#39;s more iron sitting in the mitochondria because the mitochondria feel that we don&amp;#39;t have enough iron because it&amp;#39;s not making the iron sulfur cluster so there&amp;#39;s a complex series of changes and the compound that has been tried uh most is a chelating agent called deferring prone chelating agents have been around an ion chelation is a commonly used treatment for patients with sickle cell disease who get a lot of a lot of blood transfusion get an iron overload so what you see we a number of open label studies were done with very variable results and there was a large multiple dose study and unfortunately the larger doses actually the neurological function got worse so obviously these compounds have multiple effects of the brain and the system so it was not a good experience it also has concerns for blood blood toxicity with these drugs like death report the new drug in terms of iron handling is called ap743 it&amp;#39;s now called ptc743 it inhibits an enzyme called lipo oxygenase and this enzyme triggers the cell death that occurs with the increased iron this called ferroptosis that this term is used to indicate cell that the cell death that is caused by iron small studies have shown some encouraging results and i&amp;#39;m hearing from ptc that there is a double-blind flexible control study on the way for a ptc 743 can i have the next slide please we talked about the epigenetics we talked about how the histones kind of cluster around the promoter close off the gene the promoter so that the gene cannot be activated we talked about the fact that the lack of acetyl molecules uh is is a is a problem here and if you can improve the acetylation of these histones you can open up this chromatin or heterochromatin the histones and this will allow for the production of more mrna and more protein and you can do this with a number of molecules called h-tac inhibitors h-tag stands for histone d-acetylase so these are uh enzymes that take off the acetal molecule and if you can inhibit those enzymes you will be able to perhaps open up the chromatin and open up the gene um interestingly there are large number of htag inhibitors some of them are known medications like lithium for example it&amp;#39;s an hdi kinematic as is depict which is used in epilepsy it&amp;#39;s an edge like inhibitor but there are also many many histones and many many ways of uh adding or subtracting acetyl molecules from these histones so you have to screen a large number of these molecules to try and find the best one for free drugs ataxia and this has been done primarily by the laboratory of dr gottisfeld in san diego and finally they identified a compiler from 109 they called it compound 109 and this was seemed to be the most promising and it got a very small trial that was published in 2014 and i show you a couple of pictures as you can see this was just four patients uh they were exposed to the drug only for about four or five days 148 hours and then there were placebo arm and treated on and what this here shows you is a measurement i believe in the peripheral blood cells of fratex and mrna and you can see with the drug the abortion it does go up as it does not in in the placebo you can see it in each of these patients uh the protein measurements fratexin protein was also measured was not as impressive as the mrna measurements so this was encouraging result proof of concept that if you inhibit hdac you might be able to improve protection production compound 109 unfortunately was can i have the next slide was not taken into future additional trials it has some toxicity it does not get in the cells very well what i&amp;#39;m showing here is the attempt that uh drug companies are still i think biomariners still involved in optimizing these hdac inhibitors and we anticipate that the strategy of improving the epigenetics and making more fratexim is still going to be in trial sometime in the near future can i have the next slide please so a number of other strategies and i know people have talked about this and people have been quiet about these many of these molecules that are shown here erythropoietin gamma interferon etravarian have been found by what we call high throughput screening basically laboratories take a large number of drugs that are already known to medicine and and kind of squirt it on cells with fried rice affects your cells to see if any one of them increases protection production and the gamma interferon trial was not particularly successful did not lead us into to any results erythropoietin similarly has not had a uh enough of an effect to to can get to approval and on the right side i show you a number of papers that have been published recently that look at some very exciting strategies this is a paper describing for example gene editing uh with something like crispr cass um there are the the sticky dna that we talked about that gums up the promoter area can potentially be uh reversed by a group of compounds called oligonucleotides these are called antisense oligonucleotides or asos and there is increasing clinical experience with asos and many other genetic disorders so this is a strategy that&amp;#39;s still being developed to see if an aso can reverse that that&amp;#39;s the dna configuration uh allowing better fratex in production uh synthetic things that can overcome the the problem with the ga repeat are also being developed and finally this interesting thing called a fusion protein so in general it is difficult to put a protein directly into any organism including human beings you cannot inject proteins or you cannot put it into your diet i mean you can but the the the way the the particular protein like fertilizer will get destroyed into its component amino acids so it&amp;#39;s not going to be preserved as the protein you want but an interesting group of compounds that come up these are called self-penetrating peptides these are short protein molecules that have the ability to kind of preserve itself in circulation and then be able to enter the cells through the cell membrane and so dr payne&amp;#39;s laboratory for example had the clever idea of fusing a self-penetrating peptide called the tat protein with fratexing so these two are fused together in a genetically engineered way and now he is able to inject this into intact organisms and be able to let it get into cells it can actually get into the mitochondria and then the fratexin comes out and makes the mature protection is able to work in a protection deficient model so this is an exciting avenue and there is an early trial with a fusion protein ct 1601 that began dosing last december but has been kind of held back because of covet pandemic and we expect some early safety tolerability results from this study hopefully in the next year so this is really exciting if you&amp;#39;re able to get enough retexan into your system you should be able to much you know much better than targeting some of the down downstream pathway but uh the problems with these strategies are you know can we get the protein into where it needs to go and and how much amount and so on and so forth so this study is just begun can i have the next slide please and i want to talk a little bit about a direct chain replacement of course that&amp;#39;ll be the most exciting way if it&amp;#39;s possible if it can do it in the right way to get the gene into the system and then you be able to make enough of the protection to rescue the cells that are affected by fructoxidexia the problem is gene genes is again the same as proteins you cannot inject the naked gene dna into human beings or any organism it will get destroyed by enzymes so you have to put the gene in what we call a vector so you need a vector to carry the gene into the system and then a number of different vectors that have been thought about and been worked on and the i had the fortune of working with uh dr barry byrne and dr mano corti who uh organized the powell gene therapy center here at uf so whatever i speak of and my knowledge comes from talking to these experts in gene therapy earlier on 20-25 years ago they used the virus called the adenovirus which is a cold virus to put the genes back but it had toxicity so the the field was held back till we recognized the possibility that we can use a virus called adeno associated virus aav so this is just a cartoon of an aab and what you see it&amp;#39;s spiky things on that on the outside and again people have become virologists since the covale epidemic has started these this is the protein capsid that encloses the viral dna the nice thing about aav is that it is not toxic in moderate doses it doesn&amp;#39;t produce disease in human beings so you can give this to human beings without causing any direct disease and what the clever people in the gene therapy center do is of course to gut the dna to get the viral uh genes out of the system and then put the gene of interest that we call a transgene in the case of free direct syntax here the fritoxin gene is put into the virus these uh these are called inverted terminal repeats these are the two ends of the vital genome right here this gives you a little bit more detail here is the gene of interest that you put in the in the viral genome and is encased in the capsid which is the protein part of the virus uh you can inject it into the blood uh or wherever you want to inject it it gets picked up by the cell by this little output ring and this kind of breaks off and forms this little what we call endosome the virus is still in there the cell has an ability to open it up and the virus is released of course the virus contains the gene that you&amp;#39;re interested in putting back into the into the human being and then eventually uh it actually goes through a nuclear nuclear pore complex this is the new place so this is the cytoplasm this is the nucleus as you all know it is in the within the nucleus where all the genetic action is and then when it gets into the nucleus the virus gets uncoated the protein capsule goes away and here you have the gene of interest now another good thing about aab is it is what we call a non-integrating virus so this virus does not get attached to the human genome it kind of stays away in the form of what we call a like a a a separate entity and this gene now within the viral context but the human gene can sit in the nucleus and start protein putting out the protein so it will make a copy of the the gene mrna it&amp;#39;ll come out and make the protein in a non-dividing cell like a nerve cell so nerve cells don&amp;#39;t divide on unlike for example blood cells so in the case of blood cells if you put this in of course once the blood cells are divided and then destroyed the vital dna will go away but now in a non-dividing cell this transgene that you put in there can stay for a long period of time and we still don&amp;#39;t know how long it will last but theoretically after one injection it could last for the entire life of the individual in a non-dividing cell can in the next slide please so this is the construct that the paul gene therapy center here at uf uh have developed what you see here is the the inverted terminal repeats of the virus the human fratexin gene is put in the context after cutting out the viral genes uh it has got a promoter uh this promoter is picked to make sure that this can activate the gene in multiple tissues because in the case of frederick&amp;#39;s atexia we want to get the gene in and make it active in in the brain in different parts of the brain in different parts of the spinal cord in the different parts of the system such as the pancreas and the heart so this is called a chick chicken beta actin promoter uh it has some regulatory elements and one of the problems is uh certainly even though it&amp;#39;s non-toxic the higher the dose the more likely that you have some toxicities so how do we limit the dose in hardin so we need to still figure out what the dose of these viral delivery would be the strategy that we are developing is to do a combined systemic delivery and uh put in some of the genes uh the aav virus into the spinal fluid at the same time so a intravenous shot as well as an intrathecal shot into the spinal fluid to get to various parts of the brain and the spinal cord and primarily the heart and other tissues that may be affected in friedreich&amp;#39;s atexia i can have the next slide please the current studies in the laboratory include we have models for example we have something called a mouse knockout model where the gene has been knocked out in the heart and these mice get the cardiomyopathy that you can get with frederick&amp;#39;s atexia and you can see that the survival of these animals is improved if you if you inject them with the aav9 protection after you knock out the fetexin gene in in the heart there are rat studies that are going on that primarily to look at the biodistribution whereas where does it end up does it go to the heart does it go to the brain and and and things like that and also we are uh we have completed a large number of non-human primate studies and monkeys to see first of all is it toxic and is it getting in the different parts of the brain when we do this combined injection of peripheral injection as well as intrathecal injection can have the next slide please um can i have the next slide please yeah and this is just another quick example the mice that are knocked out lose weight but if you can rescue the weight loss in these animals by providing the protection in a aav9 vector the gene so gene therapy rescues the weight loss in these animals so we&amp;#39;re developing these early pre-clinical results with gene therapy can i have the next slide please um yeah so in the last few slides there are a number of difficulties of course these are not easy things to do and and one of the problems we face with any of these viruses and other kinds of novel therapies is toxicity and related to immune response and again this is the topic that&amp;#39;s discussed a lot in the core with 19 atmosphere how much you know immune response you get but the problem in gene therapy is when you get an immune response against the av it can cause toxicity so there is an intense immune response to a large dose you can get inflammation you can do liver problems or platelet problems and things like that so we had to work that out a little bit more in addition to that if you if you have an immune response it may not allow the gene to be expressed so you may lose the effectiveness of the gene that you&amp;#39;re putting putting back with the therapeutic protein replacement you might have a similar problem is there going to be an immune response or not and one of the problems with gene therapy right now is it&amp;#39;s not easy to do a more than one dose so we we have to take the best shot and try to get the gene everywhere we can because once you give it you are going to get an immune response and the repeat dosing may not be easy and strategies are being developed to figure out if you can do repeat dosing we still don&amp;#39;t know how much dose to be employed you know we need to use a safe dose but we need to use an effective dose we still need to be sure of where we want to get the protection in what part of the spinal cord in what part of the cerebellum does the cerebral cortex needs to be transduced as we call it do we need to put the fret x in every part of the brain we cannot assume that if you put it in the spinal fluid that it&amp;#39;s going to get everywhere so that is those are things that that are that need to be still being worked out the right time and the general concept in neurology is the the earlier you treat patients the better it will be but still we don&amp;#39;t know um you know when does the problem become more difficult to to reverse we worry about over expression if you put too much fructics in can it be toxic and one of the funny things about gene therapy is what we call therapeutic commitment unlike other interventions like drugs you can stop the drug if you feel that there&amp;#39;s a side effect but with the gene therapy it is going to be in the cell and you cannot get it out so this is a problem it&amp;#39;s called therapeutic commitment and then of course the enormous costs involved and the manufacturing process are all barriers can i have the next slide please and i want to finish up with a few slides on clinical research and clinical trials and i think many of you participate in such trials and know probably a lot more about this than i do and you you look at it from your point of view and many physicians like me may not completely understand the thought processes that go into this clearly it&amp;#39;s a voluntary process you need to provide informed consent and you don&amp;#39;t have to participate in research but it&amp;#39;s a voluntary process and we do thank all the patients and families that participate in research as you probably have already learned there are observational studies and interventional studies interventional studies of things like drug trials maybe a physical therapy intervention or some kind of intervention but there are also observational studies which plot the natural history of the disease and this is very important because these observational studies give us the kind of data that we need to design clinical trials because in clinical trials we want to do the studies most efficiently and in order to do that we need this observational data because there is research data and clinical data in our center we try to do the research visits separate from clinical visits but then there might not be some in every place but research data you know confidentiality operation to data is very important and we try to preserve it but as you know there is always concern about that in a drug trial open label studies where everybody gets a particular intervention the regulatory agencies do not like this you saw the placebo effect with some other trials so generally you need to do a placebo control study and this can be quite difficult with the disease like frederick&amp;#39;s atexia in addition to their inclusion exclusion criteria so every trial has a certain rule so just having fa does not qualify you for a fa study because there are certain other rules you may have to be able to walk or you may not have to have heart disease and so on and so forth obviously when you decide to participate you need to look at the length of the trial the number of visits travel issues missing work missing school etc etc and even though most trials are funded by grants uh i&amp;#39;m sure you know you have some cost involved for example missing work etc or picking up a dinner somewhere along the way you got to consider the side effects and in many trials if there is a significant side effect that requires hospital care or physician care we often say insurance companies have to take care of it so you need to kind of look at those things when you decide to participate in trials can i have the next slide please there are some barriers from the clinical side that we are still facing we need to have what we call clinical outcome assessments or clinical outcome measures uh we heard about these neurological scores these are not very very sensitive change is too slow it&amp;#39;s very variable so we have problems with these uh we are developing something called patient reported outcome measured so how do we question patients and get their input on what the disease is doing to them and this can be used as a measure of disease modification by a drug for example and we&amp;#39;re working on biomarkers which are quantitative measures these are things that you can actually put a number on very precisely like mri scans or imaging so for example right now as you may have heard the six centers three in the u.s one germany one in australia and one in south america in brazil collaborating on a large study called track fa which is going to look at the mri and the spinal cord and the brain as well as a number of other measures of disease progression and freedox detects here and there are fluid measurements we like to have very good method to measure for texting and so on and so forth and i put the question mark patient recruitment because uh we you know we are seeing so many studies and so many drug studies and we need to be able to recruit sufficient number of patients so with patients can get exhausted by listening about direct trials and then there are useful websites uh that you can consult and again many that you already know about next slide please and maybe the last one um so my conclusions are we have come a long way from gene discovery to possible meaningful therapies i think neuropathic therapies will uh will be very effective will have a significant impact when we learn how to do it right these are novel strategies including gene therapy but these because they&amp;#39;re novel they also have uncertain types of side effects and certain types of problems which you need to recognize and all of them may not be clearly visible with pre-clinical studies alone so we had to we had to be very careful with these studies so there are barriers still to be overcome but i believe that the friedrich community has shown that there is tremendous teamwork between families patient organizations researchers regulatory agencies and clinicians and i&amp;#39;m absolutely certain that these barriers will be overcome i want to stop there and i apologize for some of the technical glitches and i&amp;#39;m more than happy to answer questions now or i&amp;#39;m sure michelle may be able to share some questions with me later on and i&amp;#39;m happy to answer them at a later time as well thank you dr super money for your presentation uh if anybody has any questions go ahead and ask them in the chat box i know we did have a few technical difficulties so if you have the time dr subramony we&amp;#39;d love to get a few questions asked and answered absolutely one question has come in uh does gene therapy impact someone&amp;#39;s ability to take part in future clinical trials i don&amp;#39;t know the answer i don&amp;#39;t know um generally as you know um most clinical trials will say if you&amp;#39;re uh if you&amp;#39;re if you have received another experimental intervention within a certain period of time we don&amp;#39;t want you in that trial uh and so that&amp;#39;s a fascinating question i didn&amp;#39;t even think of it before because gene therapy obviously is a trial once you do it you&amp;#39;re in the trial all through your life presumably because it could it it theoretically will have an effect for a long period of time we don&amp;#39;t know that if it&amp;#39;s real or not so i don&amp;#39;t know how that shape up um i i think the research clinical investigators and pharmaceutical companies will probably design ways and and we do you know in other fields we have done combined trials you know in other words use an existing drug that already is effective and then add on another drug to see if it&amp;#39;s got a more effect so i i would think that that&amp;#39;s likely that you&amp;#39;ll be able to participate in more trials but you have to wait and see thank you another question has come in how has covid19 impacted fa research yeah um certainly it held back a number of the observational studies uh in in terms of centers uh you know the around the world this has been different we just had a conference call on the track fa study last a couple of days ago and it was clear that in the u.s we are a bit more open inside of our current situation in terms of i mean research studies for example at the university of florida we have allowed subjects to come and the uf authorities have opened up our research facility so we are able to get patients in we are careful but other places like australia and europe for example their lockdown rules are much stricter so they may not be able to put subjects as quickly as we&amp;#39;re doing and of course the situation can change um i don&amp;#39;t know what else i mean i might i&amp;#39;m not the most expert in pharmaceutical industry i suspect that the financial issues have probably have had some impact but i don&amp;#39;t know that that for sure and you know the financial impact that recovered on various things including pharmaceutical industry and patient organizations is something we need to think about great another question is there any specific diets vitamins or supplements that fa patient should take or be on frankly i have not done that with my patients but as i you know i mean some of our patients do they continue to take advantage on and if you&amp;#39;re going to take something i&amp;#39;d have been on and thymine because those are easily available uh potentially not particularly toxic the other antioxidants are more difficult iodine is difficult to get as well in the u.s uh one of the problems with these antioxidants is the dose the in the later studies and they&amp;#39;ve been on they use doses like 1300 milligrams a day which is pretty large dose not supported by insurance so it becomes expensive if you get it from other countries like canada or europe vitamin b1 what is what you could try it okay i don&amp;#39;t see any more questions coming in feel free to ask any more questions while we finish up this presentation i would like to thank our presenter today dr subramony we sincerely appreciate your time and expertise and everything you do for the fa community during this presentation dr super money mentioned clinical trials and research if you have any questions about clinical trials or would like to learn more about clinical trials and research mda has recently created a clinical trial series

    "transcript": "well this platform is so useful and relevant to us in many ways first of all more generally it will deeply enrich and enhance our natural history data as it currently exists secondly in doing so it will give us far more understanding and a more precise understanding of a natural progression of our disorder thereby helping us design better clinical trials to come up with far better end points for those clinical trials and largely because the the the natural history data we will obtain from our industry partners is data from their clinical trials from either to the baseline data or the placebo arm data which looks identical to natural history data and the beauty of it is it&amp;#39;s taken far more frequently our normal natural history data is taken only once a year when the patient comes to our clinical sites for examination whereas the clinical trial data is taken monthly or every three months and so forth so the same patients getting far more data greatly enriched in our natural history so we designed better clinical trials that put the therapy on trial rather than trial design on trial a rare disease advocacy group should participate with this platform for the biggest reason I know this is the biggest draw for your whole disease group biggest draw for our industry partners it has absolutely changed the landscape of our therapy development in Friedreich&amp;#39;s ataxia because this is the the key thing that an industry partner needs along with our patient registry which is a demographic demographic registry we use for recruitment in our clinical Network which all are collated with our natural history database these are the biggest draws for industry partners we started with zero industry partners zero clinical trials in our 20 years of experience because we have the world&amp;#39;s by far the world&amp;#39;s largest natural history database in Friedreich&amp;#39;s ataxia we have changed that landscape to now more than three dozen industry partners and we with them operated more than two dozen clinical trials so that&amp;#39;s the basic reason a patient advocacy group should participate in this platform it will greatly enrich their natural history so they draw more and more industry partners to conduct more and more clinical trials to get their treatments and cures so to tell you a little bit about what natural history really is to put it in a nutshell it is the data that we compiled on each patient showing what the natural progression of this disease is it helps us understand the disease and its natural progression without treatment this is what would happen to the patient over time if they don&amp;#39;t get a treatment so it shows you the progression of that disease without intervention over time to basically understand what the disease is what it affects how are these kids progressing and therefore which target should we select to change that trajectory which targets would be most important to that patient and their ability to perform their activities of daily living and the impact their quality of life so it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s really the history of that patient without treatment and demonstrates how important it is to get that treatment for those patients or this will happen the other importance of Natural History to our disease group in all disease groups is that it&amp;#39;s the fundamental data set that drug companies use to design their clinical trials they come to us in advance of designing their clinical trials sometimes in advance of their even selecting a target and in selecting a drug to approach that target they want to know what is the natural history what how are your patients doing what symptoms are most important to them what are code what symptoms are causing the most difficulty in their daily lives that we should target and then they sit down with our key opinion leaders and RF error management and determine ok from among your the the patients that are in your natural history data what what&amp;#39;s the profile of a patient that will be well suited for our clinical trial for our therapeutic can you tell us what age group would be involved can you tell us what their characteristics would be can you tell us about any confounding medications they might be on do they have a serious heart condition do they have a suit do they have diabetes and so forth that might include or exclude them from our clinical trial basically can you help us using your natural history data design our clinical trial then we will share with you our protocol summary for that clinical trial and get your comments have we gotten it right so all that&amp;#39;s about accessing our analysis of our natural history and that&amp;#39;s why it&amp;#39;s so important that our patients are coming to us on a regular basis to develop at Natural History and so important that this platform is allowing us to take into that natural history the clinical trial data from placebo arm and enrollment you know the screening process the baseline data because our industry partners we can&amp;#39;t expect them to share with us their clinical trial drug arm data I mean that&amp;#39;s all proprietary that&amp;#39;s what that&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s going to help them get to a treatment and get onto the market but they are quite willing and we&amp;#39;ve built such a wonderful culture in our community that has them being fully collaborative they&amp;#39;re quite willing to share with us their baseline data and their placebo arm data which is identical to natural history and they know how that will enrich our natural history database so they can come to us later and enjoy the benefits of a better design clinical trial because it&amp;#39;s a richer deeper fuller understanding of our natural history so Farrah&amp;#39;s experience in this field regarding this this wonderful platform is very encouraging indeed encouraging for us at Farah encouraging for our colleagues and other disease groups because we have because of the culture we have built we&amp;#39;re having companies come to us having just completed a clinical trial with the willingness to share their data from baseline and placebo arm we already have four large data sets from these industry partners the next three are already being processed and there will be more and more with each clinical trial that&amp;#39;s completed we have every confidence that these companies will continue to share their baseline and placebo arm data so as to fully enrich into any extent possible our natural history database to plan their future clinical trials and that process is already changing our universe we because of that collaborative spirit and the availability of what we like to call our triad of the or the three-cornered stool of our patient registry which is demographic and primarily for recruitment a recruitment tool and our clinical network and our natural history database they&amp;#39;ve been successful in combination in drawing now more than three dozen industry partners eager to design their clinical trials with us they&amp;#39;re even eager to choose Friedreich&amp;#39;s ataxia as a target because they&amp;#39;d like to say you are a you have so well characterized your disease you are our turnkey operation just add good drug",

    "transcript": "hi my name is sydney and this is my story with bridger&amp;#39;s fantasia retort [Music] most of you probably know me from tick tock where i have over a million followers now so you probably saw my last fa video and now i&amp;#39;m just gonna kind of remake that video now it&amp;#39;s been almost a year and kind of give you guys an update on what&amp;#39;s going on with me and i want to remake it because now i&amp;#39;m a lot more comfortable on camera back then i think i had like made a hundred thousand followers on tick tock and i was very new to like filming and creating videos and speaking so i was very awkward and it wasn&amp;#39;t a good video so now i&amp;#39;m redoing it so my name is sydney dubray i am 21 years old now and i have a disability called registered hexia or fa for short because that&amp;#39;s so hard to say but anyway so fa is a very rare inherited neuromuscular disease which means that it affects all the nerves and all the muscles in your body it is also progressive so it gets worse over time which you might have already seen some progression from my last video to this video because it has been almost a year and i have regrets since then if you didn&amp;#39;t know i am in a wheelchair you can&amp;#39;t really see right now but if you know me from tick tock you&amp;#39;ll know that i&amp;#39;m in a luxury even though fa affects all your nerves and all your muscles it does not affect your cognitive ability um is purely a physical disease and not a mental one so everything is still good up here i&amp;#39;m gonna quickly go through my life story with the bae if you want a more in-depth longer description go to my last cfa video but i&amp;#39;m going to retell it right now sorry to first show some since the ffa whenever i was around 7 or eight years old when i was in like elementary school i had a lot of trouble walking and trouble going up and down the stairs i had bad handwriting i played a lot of sports so i had trouble running and things like that when i was playing sports and i actually have an older brother who also has fa and he was diagnosed whenever i was five years old so whenever i was like seven or eight years old and i started to show these symptoms my parents were kind of in denial about it and they didn&amp;#39;t really want to believe that i also had it as well as my brother so for like a year or two they just thought that oh i&amp;#39;m walking funny because i&amp;#39;m copying my brother and watching how he walked so i&amp;#39;m learning to walk that way um but after the sentence continue for a while and they got slowly worse my parents realized okay she probably actually does have fa so i went to the doctor and i got diagnosed with beve at two years old and when embarrassed being diagnosed with that bae they have to do a lot of tests a lot of blood tests and uh gene testing and all that kind of stuff and they actually found in my blood test that i had another disease called grace disease um and grace disease is thermal problem and i actually almost died from that but luckily we caught it because i was being diagnosed with that bae so if any and being diagnosed with that baby was kind of a blessing in this guys so i went to elementary school i was very positive i had a lot of friends i was very outgoing and i didn&amp;#39;t really show any of my sentence yet and then i got to middle school like 6 7 8th grade and i started to show a lot more symptoms and i started walking here and people could obviously tell that something was off with me and all my friends slowly started to distance themselves from me then i went to high school and i went through my freshman year of high school started progressing a lot worse walking making very difficult and i&amp;#39;ve been started to slowly lose all my friends at that point and then the summer before my sophomore year of high school i had to have surgery on my spine because i had severe scoliosis which is also a symptom of methane and i have scoliosis so i had surgery on my spine whenever that happened no one came to visit me like none of my friends came to visit [Music] um no one like asked how i was doing and then uh that was over the summer and then i went back to school the next year and i started using water full-time i was using one like when i walked a lot or traveled but then i started using them full-time so it was very weird because i showed up to my first day of school in 10th grade i showed up in a wheelchair and no one had ever seen me in the wheelchair before and it was very weird and awkward and long so short no one talked to me after i started using washer i lost all my friends and that was that so i pretty much spent all of high school alone and didn&amp;#39;t really have friends or anything didn&amp;#39;t go out and then i went to college after i graduated high school and i met all these new people and made all new friends and even my boyfriend there and reported when i was in college and now we&amp;#39;ve been together for almost two years we have an apartment together and we have a dog together i only went to college for two semesters and then i dropped out moved home and i was over being at home all the time so i started posting on tick tock and i suddenly gained a following on there and now less than a year later i&amp;#39;m at a million dollars which is really crazy to me now i&amp;#39;m posting everything on facebook but not only that i am getting back to youtube i know i said that like last time and then stuff happened i moved and in my apartment and then a hurricane happened and then another hurricane happened and then a snowstorm happened and there was a lot going on but i&amp;#39;m back now and i want to start posting regularly and just like anyone tick tock and i also post on instagram and i stream on twitch now [Music] um [Music] now i&amp;#39;m gonna do a little q and a nfa q a faq faq a was it good faq fa q i asked you guys asking questions on tick tock about fa and how i deal with that va so i&amp;#39;m gonna answer some questions now how independent are you on a day-to-day basis so i&amp;#39;m pretty independent i live with my boyfriend but he works uh in the morning so i&amp;#39;m alone all morning i get up myself out of bed i do everything like uh get ready myself i get dressed myself i do my own makeup um i take care of my dog i feed my dog all that i can do my own right now it is slow and clumsy but i can still do it so that&amp;#39;s good do you still feeling in your legs and are you in your chair all day i do still feeling my legs but it is slowly going away so my toes i can&amp;#39;t really feel at all and it&amp;#39;s slowly spreading upwards but i do still have some feeling and my legs but it&amp;#39;s very delayed like you&amp;#39;ll touch my leg and i&amp;#39;ll feel it so like a second later that kind of thing and i do spin i spin [Music] i spend most of the day in my chair and then i sleep in my bed at night but when i&amp;#39;m not in my bed at night i&amp;#39;m pretty much a mature all day does anyone else in your family have a babysitter to you yes my older brother has a faith and also i had a second cousin who had a faith but he passed away since um my brother was diagnosed in 2005 and he was actually the first person ever and my mom or my dad&amp;#39;s side of the family to ever be diagnosed with that bae and it was the first time anyone had ever heard of it so yeah can you have kids biologically i can have kids if i wanted to but i don&amp;#39;t want to um but if i heard a bible beforehand it would depend on who their father is but because i have birthday and it is an assassin because i have my hand with [Music] the [Music] if the father was not a carrier of the defective dream the child would not have faith but because i have ffa they would be a carrier of it there&amp;#39;s really no way to escape having the defective gene if i would have a biological kid because i have fa what would you say to young people with your disability or in a similar condition i would say so with the faith is progressive so do whatever you want to do while you can don&amp;#39;t wait because your condition will get worse so if you want to do something do it now don&amp;#39;t don&amp;#39;t put it off because you might not get through one day it doesn&amp;#39;t make it harder to talk sometimes yes fba does affect your speaking um it calls this very slow speech and it also causes you to be out of breath because that pain does cause a lot of heart and breathing problems so i know like for me the hardest part especially when i&amp;#39;m talking a lot like right now um i run out of breath very quickly so like i&amp;#39;ll start a sentence and then i&amp;#39;ll run out of breath so the mms sentence will be like very quiet or like you can&amp;#39;t really hear what i&amp;#39;m saying do kids in school treat you differently and it&amp;#39;s all the attention you get for being so pretty on your when unusual was in school i was pretty much just ignored i was never like bullied to my face but people would saw kind of behind my back and i was just ignoring and didn&amp;#39;t really have any friends or anything as far as being called pretty all the time it&amp;#39;s very weird and i&amp;#39;m a very awkward person after saving compliments and that also plus your compliments online and comments and stuff um i i don&amp;#39;t know it&amp;#39;s just weird he ever struck on the blood clothes on i do struggle to put clothes on but i can do it by myself it&amp;#39;s just it is a struggle and i normally if i have to like put on a lot of layers or something in the winter i&amp;#39;m like out of breath and like tired by the time i get dressed but i can still do it myself which i&amp;#39;m very grateful for this is my dog billie jean or billy she&amp;#39;s the french photo she wanted to be here for the outro that is all for this youtube video my fa story retold you tired let me know what you guys want to see from me in the future i want to start making more youtube videos and uploading regularly um um yeah thank you for watching and thank you for supporting me on six dogs in here i really appreciate it any love guys bye",

    "transcript": "and now we&amp;#39;ll be able to move on to our next session and I&amp;#39;ve got a great group of panelists to help us in this next session this is our first pipeline session where we&amp;#39;re going to talk about treatments that are in development for fa can we go on to the slides thanks all right so quickly I&amp;#39;m just going to introduce who our panelists are and what we&amp;#39;re going to do I&amp;#39;m going to give an overview of kind of how we think about developing treatments for fa and the pipeline in general and then I&amp;#39;m going to give an overview on each program kind of where things are at and then ask our panelists some questions to further clarify um what&amp;#39;s going on in their programs and how it relates to everyone in our community and then we&amp;#39;ll open it up to all of you so that you can ask your questions so we have Wendy Agnes from from Biogen Wendy is the head of the US medical rare disease team we have John Cherry from PTC Therapeutics John is the global Project Lead for vinone we have Shaina McCormick who you just met from the Children&amp;#39;s Hospital of Philadelphia and we have Jean Kelly from stealth Biotherapeutics he&amp;#39;s the executive director of medical Affairs so thank you all so much um for being here today with us so Dr Lynch went over this briefly when we think about therapies we try and Target therapies from multiple different perspective so when we think about what&amp;#39;s causing fa we&amp;#39;re trying to Target therapies that address all these different issues whether we&amp;#39;re targeting the Gene and later pipeline session two is going to talk about ways that we might think about um targeting F toxin protein deficiency as well as the underlying genetic cause of fa this panel session we&amp;#39;re going to focus more on the downstream consequences of f toxin deficiency so that impaired mitochondrial function and what&amp;#39;s going on in the mitochondria and the cell that we can ways in which we can kind of reverse or stop the downstream consequences of for taxin deficiency and then evaluates how that impacts the symptoms that people with fa experience and so this is just another way to think about that for me I always think of fa as a Cascade right of things that happen and there are two ways to think about it one starting at the gene but you can also think about it from starting with the symptoms what bothers you the most and how do we help treat fa when we think about the symptoms and that was also part of what you heard in the last session even though we might not have the Cure yet there are are ways to treat the symptoms of fa we can treat diabetes in FA um and we want to then also treat what&amp;#39;s happening in the cell and what&amp;#39;s happening at the genetic level I hope all of you are familiar with this image um and if you&amp;#39;re new and you&amp;#39;re not this is um our drug development Pipeline and so this is not all the research that&amp;#39;s going on in FA these are programs that that are in clinical development in clinical trials if we put everything up here that was currently in earlier stages of of treatment um we&amp;#39;d have to have you here for the whole week and to go through all of them and this would be a much bigger more complicated picture which is exciting um but you know we really want to focus on the things where um the the programs have progressed to the point of Clinic we have um a first approv treatment in omaveloxolone um and you see that at the top and the goal here is to advance therapies from the left to the right um in terms of stage of development and go from those early preclinic stages through clinical trials to approv treatments and the different colors as you go down the slide are different target areas for those therapies so up at the top in this session we&amp;#39;re going to focus on improving mitochondrial function and some of the downstream consequences of for toxin deficiency and then some of the other therapies that we&amp;#39;re going to cover in the afternoon are on the latter portion of the slide targeting the protein and genetic therapies the website that I mentioned earlier has a much more detailed version of the treatment pipeline um I see Barbara is here arates our scientific officer she keeps that pipeline up to date every time there&amp;#39;s a development on any of these programs we put it on the website in the section for each of these programs and so try and you know have that in your kind of tabs of frequently visited sites to just go back to and see what&amp;#39;s new in terms of development for all these programs it&amp;#39;ll be there so I&amp;#39;m going to start with omalo um so I think I hope all of you know that omaveloxolone is a first approved treatment for FAA in individuals 16 and older but what is omab if you&amp;#39;re new to the community what is this how is it working omav is a small molecule that increases antioxidant activity improves mitochondrial function by activating a pathway called Nrf2 and so in the cont context of fa what we&amp;#39;ve learned through some of the basic science studies a long time ago is that when F toxin&amp;#39;s deficient and there&amp;#39;s mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress Nrf2 is a pathway that your cells should be activating to help compensate for that and paradoxically it&amp;#39;s not and so with omav we can activate that Nrf2 Pathway to reverse some of those Downstream consequences of the ferin deficiency and so omav helps to restore Nrf2 activity and we saw that in cells and animal models and now tested that in clinical trials and the clinical trials that were first done were in individuals with fa 16 and older those trials demonstrated safety and efficacy um that got the drug approved Biogen has helped provide us an update for today these updates were provided for Farah to be able to present and discuss with you um and so we have some disclaimers and but again you know the this is an exciting time right we have approved treatments I have to give disclaimers but one of the first questions we get is what about if I&amp;#39;m not 16 and older and so we&amp;#39;ve been working on putting together um plans for Pediatric clinical trial and that&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s going to be required to expand access of omf to younger populations and so earlier this year in July uh we announced the opening of a phase one pharmacokinetic or PK clinical trial and the goal that study is to identify the appropriate dose of omav in children with fa um they project to enroll 20 individuals ages 2 to 15 it&amp;#39;s a single sight study at the Children&amp;#39;s Hospital of Philadelphia and the first cohort of individuals aged 12 to 15 were enrolled and have completed the study a few weeks ago we announced en open enrollment for two more cohorts of um individuals 6 to 11 and another 12 to 15 age group so Wendy my first question for you or you know maybe you can help us why why do we need a PK study if the drug is already approved you know can you explain to us why we need this study and what Biogen needs to learn from it absolutely thank you Jen and it&amp;#39;s wonderful to be here again um with you all so thank you for your part participation in in this meeting so with any investigational drug you&amp;#39;re going to work it through different stages and you just use the word Cascade I love that it&amp;#39;s a Cascade of different research that needs to happen before you can get to that regulatory filing so when you think about a pharmacokinetic study what does that mean what are we looking to achieve with this phase one program so pharmacokinetic when you think about that what we&amp;#39;re really looking to understand is if you give a drug an investigational drug this case because we&amp;#39;re studying it in a population that&amp;#39;s we don&amp;#39;t have current approval for we&amp;#39;re really trying to understand how the body is affecting the drug so when you think about drug development often we think about the flip side of that what is the drug doing to the body here we&amp;#39;re really trying to characterize when you give a certain dose to a certain patient population in this case a pediatric patient population what are those different pharmokinetic things mean and what we&amp;#39;re describing there is you give a drug how is it absorbed throughout your body then how is it distributed to the different tissues in your body is it getting to where it needs to be how is your drug that how&amp;#39;s your body reacting how are you metabolizing and breaking down that drug and then how do you excrete that I think the vitamin D conversation we talked about some of the the ways that you can excrete different metabolites through your system so that&amp;#39;s really the focus of a on do type of key case study and it&amp;#39;s that characterization all those data points together that we can pull to really understand are we getting the right dose for this very specific patient population in this case Pediatrics so it&amp;#39;s a one dose that&amp;#39;s why if you participate in these studies you often get a lot of labs drawn it&amp;#39;s because all this data needs to be collected and then that gives us the confidence that we can move forward into a bigger study often called a phase three program to study it more broadly so Jen alluded to the different cohorts that we currently have so we look at different groupings of Ages so we have the 12 to 15year Old which is where we started um that first cohort or or grouping of patients in the phase one study is complete those analyses are ongoing and now the second two cohorts we&amp;#39;re going it A2 and B those are active at David Lynch&amp;#39;s site so thank you to everyone participating and helping move that study at chop and then the last cohort um would then be our youngest patient so that would be the two to five-year-olds in the patient and that would be the next step that will be informed by these earlier cohorts in the phase one program Wendy is there any chance that there might need to be additional cohorts in those 6 to 11 or 12 to 15 after like the this next round of testing so right now we&amp;#39;re aiming for the 20 patients as you alluded to and that very thoughtful approach of breaking out the different age groups to really understand there might be differences in the potential doses that you see in those we don&amp;#39;t have that that data yet so that&amp;#39;s where you do one cohort and it forms what you need to do in the next so we announced Farah announced the two cohorts that are active now and that fourth cohort would then be that final cohort in the PK study and then we&amp;#39;re hopeful that will give us the information we need to really select that dose to carry forward into the larger pediatric program thank you and so we need to figure out how the drugs metabolized in children if it&amp;#39;s different than adults and know what the right dose is going to be in children um because we still need to do um what&amp;#39;s called an efficacy study so like a phase three study where the drugs given to children for a longer period of time to further establish safety but then also to know how the drug is helping um those individuals do we see the same response that we saw in previous clinical trials that correct yep so it it&amp;#39;s a very good point to distinguish the phase one from the potential phase three um the phase one again very focused on what we want to learn around the pharmacokinetics and we&amp;#39;ll get some early signals on the safety there as well it&amp;#39;s important to note that those patients will receive the one dose of drug whatever dose that&amp;#39;s identified for and then monitored over the 15-day period for the different formico kinetic measures those patients will have the option to enroll an open label extension but even with that open label extension that won&amp;#39;t give us the robust robustness and the data that we need to feel confident that we&amp;#39;ve established that safety efficacy profile or the risk benefit profile that we would need to bring forward to regulatory authorities so that&amp;#39;s where the follow-up phase three program would come which would be dependent on the learnings from the phase one and I also think it&amp;#39;s important to say that a program like that Biogen or or industry in general would never do that in a silo so that&amp;#39;s where we&amp;#39;re really working in having continued conversations with the community with the experts in the in the space like Dr Lynch um different regulatory authorities to make sure that as we Bing a broader program forward that it will meet all the requirements because again our goal here is to bring access to the broader patient population thanks Wendy another question we&amp;#39;ve frequently get um from the community and and the global Community is you know how and when will omav be available globally and I know now that there&amp;#39;s been an approval uh earlier this year in the European Union um and the drug is now available in 12 markets outside the US I believe all of those I believe all of those are Europe is that correct so it&amp;#39;s um it&amp;#39;s a process for sure the teams are working um with urgency to bring this forward more in global markets that&amp;#39;s really the goal again to help as many patient as we can so us was the first approval um earlier this year in February we did have the authorization from the EU Union the European Union that is the umbrella deciding organization over 27 European countries so it&amp;#39;s important to note that that was a huge milestone when we think about access at the global level but that doesn&amp;#39;t mean immediate access in every region so the EU Authority took the recommendations if you hear other words like EMA or champ those are the parts of the EU organization that review all the data and make that recommendation then the EU Union took that and approved it or gave the authorization for Access so now Biogen continues to work at the regional level globally um to really work through those reimbursement and access issues that can really vary in the different countes so that&amp;#39;s an ongoing process that we continue to support at a global level at the regional level um with that that&amp;#39;s the EU approval um we&amp;#39;ve also recently submitted filings in Australia Brazil and Argentina as well so the team is very active in continuing those conversations more broadly again to make sure that we can help as many patients as possible great thank you I know it&amp;#39;s important to to continue to understand how omav works over a longer period of time and often what we call in the real world and so um Biogen is planning um additional studies of omav even in individuals 16 and older and so one of those studies is what we call a post approval safety study um the acronym for this study is pass um but um the idea here is when folks are coming into the clinic for natural history study visits um if you are newly taking or going to soon take um omav alo alone we&amp;#39;ll be able to prospectively collect data um when people start taking omav for a long period of time for five years to collect that ongoing long-term safety data um Wendy can you tell us a little bit more about you know kind of the importance of these studies and any any additional information you want to share absolutely so um in the opening session you spoke to the unify and the importance of that Global opportunity now within the clinical Consortium so this will be an opportunity to work with those sites to again collect data in an observational way when patients choose with their physician to start pyus omoone therapy and the importance there is again real world data it&amp;#39;s so rich and important to understand and make sure that what we saw in the clinical trials is translating in real world and that&amp;#39;s where the post marketing commitments like a past study the post approval safety study will be very important so the goal here is going to collect longitudinal data over the course of five years in all of the 300 patients that would be enrolled in this study and the key piece here too is that we&amp;#39;ll collect data points along the way so if patients see within the past study the protocol their physician at we at the beginning at B Baseline and then months 1 2 3 6 12 and then annually after that that gives us a really robust data collection to be able to analyze along the way and share back with the community what those learnings are from a safety perspective and this is a fiveyear study you said do we wait the full five plus years to know what happened or is there the opportunity to kind of learn along the way what this shows us because five years is a long we&amp;#39;ll take approach on that one yeah we&amp;#39;ll definitely learn along the way and then share those key um points back not just with the community but with regulatory authorities with the medical community I think there&amp;#39;ll be um Rich learnings within that that that we&amp;#39;d be um eager to share great thank you um one final yeah oh okay yep okay all right you guys all heard that right all right good so Wendy my last question question for you is you know um if if someone is thinking about taking omav or they&amp;#39;re taking omav and they&amp;#39;re now coming up on their renewals like if they&amp;#39;re having challenges um either accessing omav or um you know need more information about it are there services available through Biogen or you know where where do people go for help H happy to answer that one so and hopefully you can hear me online if I&amp;#39;m in a little bit more and we&amp;#39;re not getting an echo in the room um so what we have is the reach program so this is our Biogen Access program resource that supports all patients on Sky Claris so this is something key to point out the beginning pieces to that is if the decision is made between the health care provider and a patient or their caregiver to start treatment The Physician then sends a start form which includes a prescription to to the Reach team that&amp;#39;s step one we also need the signature from the patient to make sure that you want to be part of this reach program those two steps activate our team within the Reach team to then support you in the entire Journey from the beginning of starting treatment throughout your journey on Sky Claris so they&amp;#39;re there as a point of contact to goto for you um there&amp;#39;s lead case managers and then we have family access managers we have them here today so I encourage you to reach out um if you have further questions than what we&amp;#39;re touching on here but they&amp;#39;re really there to help you remove any barriers or questions that you have regarded to access insurance insurance verification so again Point person um but the important piece of that would be the first piece is have that discussion with your physician and it&amp;#39;s decided is an appropriate treatment for you that&amp;#39;s when the start form goes in the signature is started and then that activates our team to proactively reach out and be there to support great thank you Wendy all right I&amp;#39;m going to move on now I&amp;#39;m going to talk a little bit about vinone um and ask John some questions um but if you have questions again for any of the panelists we&amp;#39;re going to make sure we leave time so what is vinone um vinone um you may have heard of it previously as PTC 743 uh we&amp;#39;ve done previous clinical trials with vinone it is an inhibitor of 15 lipoxygenase um there won&amp;#39;t be a quiz on that later you don&amp;#39;t have to remember that but I think you&amp;#39;ll see an evolving theme Here F toxin deficiency right um causes mitochondrial dysfunction that leads to oxidative stress when there&amp;#39;s chronic oxidative stress which we have in case of a chronic condition like fa that oxidative stress tries to initially activate things like 15 lipoxygenase to come in and help dampen that oxidative stress but in chronic condition you kind of get these um Vicious Cycles that develop and so 15 lipoxygenase when it is overly activated starts to become harmful and so vinone inhibits that harmful like think of it like an accelerant right in a fire that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s the analogy that does that work John yep that works okay U think of 15 lipoxygenase acting as an accelerant and vinone kind of coming in as the fire extinguisher and dampening down this vicious cycle that is further damaging the mitochondria vinone has been studied like I said before in FA and and also other mitochondrial diseases um and has a lot of safety data and and really um long-term safety data more than 10 years of use so about a year ago we completed a clinical trial called move FAA this was a global study to be a registration quality study to and that means to hopefully eventually support um an approval of the drug in pediatric individuals and young adults with fa this was a place control trial so when people came into the study half got vinone half got Placebo went on for 18 months again enrolled individuals ages 7 to 21 and then there was an additional group of younger children under the age of seven um who were also enrolled in a in sort of a a parallel arm to the study at the end of 72 weeks individuals were given the choice to go into an open label extension where additional data would be collected over a longer period of time and that open label extension has been ongoing the results of that move fa pivotal trial um this is a complicated slide I know there&amp;#39;s a lot going on here but I think if you look at the left hand side of the slide what we&amp;#39;re trying to show you here and I&amp;#39;m sure in the back of the room it&amp;#39;s hard to see the primary end points that the key end points that were collected so the modified friederick sat taxia rating scale which is our standard assessment for neurologic function in the clinic that modified fried a taxia rating scale if you&amp;#39;ve done it you know it me measures lots of different things and I&amp;#39;ll talk about that in in a minute but one of which is upright stability and then we collect patient reported outcomes so your impression of how you&amp;#39;re performing on activities of daily living how fatigue is impacting your life and then also timed walk tests what you see here is that the treatment group all did better than the placebo group and on a few of these outcomes we reached statistical significance so more than chance that people improved on these outcomes um and that&amp;#39;s statistical significance is important especially when we start thinking about you know regulatory approvals right we have to show that this happened um because of a treatment effect not just by chance when you look at um that M fars okay the primary outcome measure in green here you see the treatment group and in Gray it&amp;#39;s the placebo group and what we&amp;#39;re showing here is that the people in the placebo group progressed on their MF fars more than people in the treatment group there&amp;#39;s another way to look at this and like I said mfar measures different things you&amp;#39;ve done it you&amp;#39;ve been had your speech assess what is the speech assessment of the marar what&amp;#39;s the sentence yes thank you the president lives in the White House and Well Done um you also get to do a lot of fun Upper Limb assessments right having to point to your nose and the doctor&amp;#39;s finger and then do things like this and things like this so we assess Upper Limb function lower limb function heal Shin slides and then standing and walking assessments what we&amp;#39;re showing here is that in the study population the speech assessments the Upper Limb assessments and the lower limb assessments didn&amp;#39;t change in the placebo group or the treatment group right in young kids these are not the things that are changing the most what changed in both the placebo group and the treatment group was upright stability so standing and walking and sitting and what you see is that the treatment group changed less or progressed less than the placebo group John you want to add it additional interpretation to that or kind of talk to the the clinical significance of what we&amp;#39;ve learned from this study sure um so I&amp;#39;m going to start off in saying that a lot of what we&amp;#39;ve been able to accomplish has been based on the natural history that you all have taken part of it provides so much Rich information that we could take a look at these sub skills and understand how they&amp;#39;re driving disease at different parts at different ages um and and what&amp;#39;s really assessing how the patients are changing um when we looked at this and as Jen I think I I don&amp;#39;t I&amp;#39;m gonna have you present everything because you do such a great job um what we saw was changing was really upright stability so the only thing we could impact we did impact and we&amp;#39;ve had we&amp;#39;ve been able to have a uh conversation with the FDA about this and I think again I&amp;#39;m going to call out Ron um does a fantastic job of getting in front of the people in the FDA and on the hill and make sure they understand how these scales are in measure what&amp;#39;s important to patients with fa they were ready for this conversation they understood the value of upright stability and when we brought this this to them they were they were very receptive we&amp;#39;ve been able to uh have a conversation with them and um Jen mentioned our long-term extension study they they looking at this upright stability benefit in move FAA in addition to the uh visual cuity study that was done um I think it&amp;#39;s 14 years ago at this point so I think 20 0 um and then um the additional data that we have in the extension that went beyond move FAA so the move fa extension study the FDA is looking at this data and and they&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re willing for us to bring that forward um as a unified package to show that we are impacting all aspects of disease um not just in in in in children which was the primary population here but also in adults and we can show that not when we are looking at different aspects of disease we do then drive change in things like Upper Limb and lower limb so uh our plan is to submit to the FDA by the end of the year and that is still the plan and hopefully you guys will see some good news soon yeah this is the first time we&amp;#39;ve seen in a clinical trial as well an improvement in fatigue um and that you know that was something that jumped out to me the first time I saw the data because we&amp;#39;ve been collecting fatigue from the community fatigue quality of life scales for a very long time I remember early in my days in the clinic with Dr Lynch you know he always asked that question if I could fix One symptom what would it be and the number of times people said fatigue um was initially when I first started really surprising um I know it&amp;#39;s not surprising to us now but because we recognize fatigue more as an aspect of the disease but this is the first time we&amp;#39;ve been able to see an improvement in fatigue um when we&amp;#39;ve done a clinical study um so I guess the the other aspects that are also important are around sort of the the overall safety right of vinone and so John can you just summarize and speak to that briefly yeah we have uh as you as you pointed out we&amp;#39;ve we&amp;#39;ve been studying vtic for a long time now and we have extensive evidence in patients um as under one out to 68 um we&amp;#39;ve treated them in multiple different diseases fa and different types of mitochondrial disease and we can see that um the that we see similar similar issues between both Placebo and and the vitico treated groups and and to this point it&amp;#39;s very well tolerated and um we don&amp;#39;t see any significant safety signals so um that in addition to what we&amp;#39;ve been able to put together for the ethicacy is is is part of what is really helping us move the program forward and maybe the the last set of questions around the open label extension that&amp;#39;s been ongoing for a while now um will we learn additional information kind of about um the data that was collected in the open label extension and you know will that be part of you know future understandings sure yeah the um so um when we and just kind of I&amp;#39;ll touch on two things here um one when we first talked to the FDA we asked them they needed to see in order to feel comfortable with this data set and and they asked us to ensure that we had about 12 months worth of data in the open label that essentially means that for the people who started on for the the patients that started on treatment um in move FAA they&amp;#39;d have three years of total treatment and for the patients that were on Placebo they&amp;#39;d have a year and a half which is equivalent to what was in our Placebo control trial um so um first off we we have finally completed collecting that data um we&amp;#39;re taking a look at it and and watch this space we&amp;#39;ll we&amp;#39;ll pretty soon be able to to tell you what we saw um the other aspect of that is um we were asked and have been asked in panels like this multiple times whether or not we would allow omab on top of patients within this trial and because we had this agreement with the FDA to make sure we had that that set of data with just monotherapy after 12 months any patients in in the extension study can can add omav on top of us and and stay within our study thanks John all right I&amp;#39;m going to move on next um to talk about um elati um and so Jean um I&amp;#39;ve got um a little bit of background about Stealth Biotherapeutics in case uh folks don&amp;#39;t know about Stealth um elti has been um is being developed for several different mitochondrial diseases does uh bar syndrome mitochondrial myopathy um ALS duen fa um and there&amp;#39;s been more trials more outcomes in some of those other mitochondrial diseases that we actually learned from and kind of helped Inspire thinking about maybe trying elti for fa and um just a little background about what does elti do so again back to the mitochondria when there&amp;#39;s oxy of stress and the mitochondria are not functioning well not producing enough energy um it&amp;#39;s actually the the wall of the mitochondria that starts to take on damage and the wall of the mitochondria is really important because that&amp;#39;s where a lot of the action actually is in terms of the mitochondria function and so um El amtide is helping support cardiol lipen which is like an essential part of that membrane and so when there&amp;#39;s oxidative stress cardiol lipen starts to get attacked the walls of the mitochondria start to get attack and El amtide is really helping stabilize that cardiol lipen and help stabilize that mitochondrial wall anything you want to add to that Gene no just the structure and function is so important and by being able to restore the structure you see the improvements in function so instead of seeing increases decreases in ATP and increases in reactive oxygen species you start to see physiologic levels of reactive oxygen species and increases in ATP back towards normal levels and so some of the other diseases where you&amp;#39;ve looked at elati I know one of them is a rare disease called B syndrome and in B syndrome there&amp;#39;s a some overlap with fa in terms of some of the the clinical features specifically cardom opathy as well as some muscle weakness um and in the early bar syndrome trials you saw improvements in the cardiomyopathy yes we saw improvements in cardiomyopathy improvements in fatigue were one of the things we saw but it&amp;#39;s difficult to measure uh but also things like Sway and balance and and skeletal muscle strength so you know we&amp;#39;ve been targeting areas where there&amp;#39;s a lot of energy consumption where there&amp;#39;s a real need for mitochondria so things like skeletal muscle the heart and with our pipeline compounds hoping to do more with the brain and neurology and So based on some of those results from uh some of the other studies that you were done Dr Lynch um went to stealth and asked if he could do what&amp;#39;s called an investigator initiated study um looking at eler tide and seeing if it can help some specific symptoms of fa and so this study was designed to look at folks who have significant cardiac disease and or vision loss and see if elti could help some of those specific symptoms and so this was a study that again Dr Lynch um developed 16 people were enrolled into the trial um he&amp;#39;s got a few other folks I believe also on compassionate use where he&amp;#39;s following them um to look and see if the drug is going to be helpful in treating some of those symptoms um the study has been completed as of late summer and I know the team is actively analyzing those results and so we hope to be able to share those results back with the community soon um we just we don&amp;#39;t have them just yet but very soon where I know Dr Lynch and I email the statistician pretty regularly Christian if you&amp;#39;re listening go back to work so um the last thing Gan I wanted to ask you about was sort of the status with um developing eler tide for some of these other therapies and and I know specifically the bar syndrome um you know stealth has submitted that new drug application right to request approval for eler TI and bar syndrome so yeah so B syndrome is an ultra orphan disease the estimated number is about 130 patients in this country that are known to the you know the B syndrome foundation so it&amp;#39;s a very difficult disease to study to get the kind of statistical power that the FDA would like to see we&amp;#39;ve had an ongoing dialogue with the FDA for close to 10 years uh to try to figure out a way to get this approved and it it doesn&amp;#39;t fit into the traditional Pathways and you know this week There&amp;#39;s an important Milestone meeting with the FDA um where they bring in independent experts to talk about you know should this this drug be approved what are the risks what are the potential benefits and this is an area where the the community the patient advocacy Community patients who have experienced with the drug Physicians investigators who have experienced with the drug have all weighed in and if there&amp;#39;s any chance of approval it&amp;#39;s going to because of advocacy uh so again it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s an important week for us and it&amp;#39;s something people can watch online if you have any interest uh they&amp;#39;ll be streaming it live yeah and these advisory committees have open sessions um and at those open sessions community members provide direct feedback to the committee and to the FDA about their experience with the condition or with the treatment um and so this really is the opportunity for the patient voice to really um be important in the drug review and approval process we wish you guys the best on the 10th we&amp;#39;re going to be watching and Farah did submit um a letter of support um for the B syndrome community Community um earlier this week we we submitted some written written statements and Testaments to that we&amp;#39;re glad for that opportunity so the last um treatment candidate on the pipeline that I want to provide an update on um and you heard a little bit about this in the earlier session is studying NAD and exercise and because of those frequently asked questions that Dr McCormack and Dr Lynn get about you know the benefits of some of the supplements and some of uh an exercise they designed a really amazing study um to look at both supplementation of NAD precursors um the one that they&amp;#39;re specifically using in this study is called um nicotinamide riboside the dietary supplement that is an NAD precursor um again trying to deliver more energy to the cell and comparing that to exercise because some of these Pathways that we&amp;#39;re activating with something like NAD precursors you might be able to activate with exercise do I get that right Sha um and so in this study um people are randomized to nicotinamide riboside or exercise or both supplement and oops sorry about that supplement and exercise or no interven at all and studied for 12 weeks and the study enrolled individuals who were 12 to 40 years of age um and able to do exercise on a recumbent trike um you can do that in your home on a trainer um the individuals who participated in the study um got an unusual study bonus of being able to keep that recumbent exercise bike which is really amazing and for people who were randomized to know exercise were also given the opportunity at the end of the study to receive the exercise protocol to continue to be monitored um and also have access to a recumbent trike which is a really pretty phenomenal this study um was funded by the National Institutes of Health right Shana um and so where are we currently Shaina you want to kind of give us the where we are now yeah thank you so um I really appreciate that introduction and one just minor update that we&amp;#39;re down to age 10 actually for this study yes um I know probably maybe some younger ones in the audience like wait a second I was in this um so yeah this is uh this is my opportunity when I spoke with Jen to really thank the community for your for so many different reasons but the first reason is for the idea to pursue this study we got so many great questions about exercise um I&amp;#39;ll quote Bryant who&amp;#39;s a collaborator and helped us design the exercise intervention he said sha don&amp;#39;t exercise has got to be good like are you are you really not going to find that exercise is good and and as a clinician and personally I have this intuition exercise must be good right but but the details of how to do it and how to do it safely and effectively and to individualize it that is not trivial that&amp;#39;s why we have so many great questions from the community so the community came up with the idea and then when we submitted the grant to the National Institutes of Health which is your taxpayer dollars which is another really important source of potential funding for freedrick research when we submitted that Grant myself along with Dr Lynn and Dr Lynch we had support from Farah and we had Natural History data and we had information about impaired Fitness from from the from the community and that is what helped this project get funded so we had all that and then we had advocacy from you all to um to participate which has been really really amazing we&amp;#39;ve had so many active and engaged families and participants so our team we were required to submit um to the NIH uh several times a year and and I&amp;#39;ll recognize they&amp;#39;re sitting over there um um Anna Dido and um Karen mcweeny who are our lead coordinators on this project who are amazing and is required to submit to NIH our progress on recruitment um and so on the x axis here you see uh time and on the Y AIS how many people we&amp;#39;ve recruited we call this client the mountain of recruitment right like each and I remember the first we we were supposed to begin during the pandemic so we had a brief delay before we got started so um as of now as for a goal of um 72 folks enrolled with 64 with complete data so our statistician is satisfied um we&amp;#39;ve enrolled uh 61 randomized 61 and so we&amp;#39;re we&amp;#39;re really almost there we&amp;#39;ve um identified um all of our all of our um participants so so that enrollment is closed and we envision by the end of this calendar Year everyone will have been enrolled so that by early part of next year we&amp;#39;ll be finished and be able to be um analyzing the data so really so so many thanks to you all I think we&amp;#39;re going to be able to learn a lot that we thought we would learn about this study about exercise and about NAD precursors and then we&amp;#39;ve had so many more opportunities to learn um that we didn&amp;#39;t expect um over the course of the study including for example you know we&amp;#39;re enrolling people who on omav like how does omav work with exercise training like I&amp;#39;m really excited to be able to um to examine that question for example so really really grateful to everyone for for this thanks sha and we&amp;#39;re excited for those results um maybe just one additional question for you um you know as we&amp;#39;re waiting for this data Farah was also funding a study with a collaborator of yours Joe Bower at University of Pennsylvania and he took a look at NAD precursor supplementation in the fa house model and those results were recently published can you just for the for the audience kind of give us a high level what were the take-home findings from that pre-clinical animal study yeah for sure so one um privilege and I I&amp;#39;ll represent Joe Joe Bower and um Caroline Perry from Penn that I them thanking Farah um and the community for support for preclinical research is as a clinical researcher being able to partner with our basic science colleagues and learning from the animal models and figuring out um in an iterative way how can we apply those insights it&amp;#39;s been really really valuable so one of the reasons that we undertook this NAD precursor exercise study was that we found in animal models of Fredrick&amp;#39;s exercis is helpful and in one animal model um the Hershey group at Duke um an NAD precursor rescued meaning like made better the heart problems in one animal model so that&amp;#39;s always really intriguing when you have this outcome and then you go back and you say well why did that happen like that&amp;#39;s really an interesting problem to have so we thought perhaps rightly that there might be deficiency meaning not enough NAD in people with frieder taxia NAD is important for making ATP so it&amp;#39;s plausible that there&amp;#39;s not enough it&amp;#39;s also used up in a lot of really important reactions including antioxidant defenses so it really could make sense that there might not be enough NAD but the animal Studies have been discrepant like some studies say maybe there&amp;#39;s deficiencies of NAD um but other studies say no um in people it&amp;#39;s really difficult to assess accurately so so the study with Joe&amp;#39;s group um did a different animal model study again showed that an NAD precursor was able to help with survival and help with um cardiac benefits didn&amp;#39;t seem to show though that increase ining the level of NAD was the main reason that happened instead it seemed that the NAD precursor was able to help restore levels of glutathione which is essential for the body&amp;#39;s antioxidant response system so NAD subserves the ability to kind of restore one of the body&amp;#39;s natural and antioxidant systems so it seemed from um Caroline and Joe&amp;#39;s data that that may be one way in which the NAD precursor is working to help rescue the animal so then it gives us some ideas of other testing we can do in our human samples to see if that same biology could be operating in people thank you um I&amp;#39;ll open it up to our audience do you have questions for our panelists there&amp;#39;s one in the back oh Shandra yes have you guys considered different types of exercises and how it affects the Mito condal I guess energy CU it it seemed like there was the trike was the primary one in that example yeah I&amp;#39;m really appreciative of your question um so the question um have we considered different types of exercise because there&amp;#39;s lots of different ones so the trike is the focus there&amp;#39;s three sessions a week of an individualized cardio protocol so you have people do an exercise assessment in the lab so we can give them a Target intensity heart rate wise to to to complete those sessions we also having folks complete two strength sessions a week um really because as clinicians our intuition was probably that a combined form of exercise would be most appropriate and our Public Health guidelines say that we should be using both um but to the to the questioner Point like it may be that strength should be our Focus especially if we&amp;#39;re thinking about you know for example preventing Falls and and promoting bone health um so this is my plea to the group our team is sitting there I&amp;#39;ll be here we we are NIH has asked us about what we want to do next and one um question I have is about strength training because a lot of our participants seem to really enjoy that and a lot of members of the community seem to like that so we we chose a combined approach because we thought that was probably the best one but unpacking different types is absolutely a great question for future Shandra um so my question is for each of the panelists um um are there any preclinical studies on the effect of the combination of omav and your product or supplement and if there are can you briefly describe them like what they show so um we&amp;#39;re really kind of focused on clinical now uh I think the first evidence we will see would be from the combination that we&amp;#39;re seeing the open label studies um I think we we do look in some preclinical data to see how these two compounds can interact they do work through similar Pathways although not identical the the 15 and loo and how that um impacts lipid peroxides and can reduce uh depletion of glutathione I think is on one side and then you know the the ability for Nrf2 Inhibitors to upregulate glutathione and and overall drive forward um improve um oxid oxidative stress responses I think I think they are there are parallels there we haven&amp;#39;t we don&amp;#39;t quite have de evidence we can share right now our data we can share at this point but but it is something we are looking at so thank you I&amp;#39;m I&amp;#39;m happy to add to that from the uspi or the approved label that we have for Sky Claris vck Salone we do know from the earlier research that there are drug drug interactions particularly through the SI 450 pathway so there&amp;#39;s specific drugs that we would know we&amp;#39;d want to avoid but when we consider not just the potential mechanism of action but how going back to the pharmacokinetic piece and how those drugs are metabolized in your system they might actually interact and change the levels of the different drugs in your system as well so that&amp;#39;s something that with any therapy when you&amp;#39;re starting or maintaining if you&amp;#39;re adding different supplements or vitamins or other potential investigational or proof therapy that&amp;#39;s a conversation to always bring forward to your health care provider to make sure that they can evaluate that for the potential drug drug interaction as well yeah and maybe I&amp;#39;ll just also add to this Farah has funded um I think three or four different research projects this year um looking at combination Therapies in both the cell models so the IPS derived neurons and cardiomyocytes as well as in the mouse models and they&amp;#39;re combinations of some of um the therapies that we just talked about in the panel but also others as well and so hopefully several months from now we&amp;#39;ll be able to start sharing some of those results but um lots of activity lots of investigators asking Shandra that exact question and you know we have the model systems I think in place to start doing some of that and that&amp;#39;s been a priority for us well I just want to thank all of you for participating today for all of the work that you do to continue to bring treatments forward for fa um it&amp;#39;s excited exciting to hear that we&amp;#39;re also going to have a second drug being submitted um to a regulatory Agency for approval before the end of the year um wow um so thank you all and if you still have questions for our panelists they&amp;#39;re going to be here their colleagues are here all day so please you know during the break take an opportunity to talk to them and ask them your questions",

    "transcript": "hi I&amp;#39;m Kate and welcome to my channel if you&amp;#39;ve never seen my face before I was diagnosed with The Branding disease called Frederick&amp;#39;s taxia in May of 2016 when I was 12. in the last video I posted I talked a little bit more about my story and journey with the rare disease and my diagnosis story most people have never heard of Frederick sarcia or Pepe because there is a rare so today I&amp;#39;m going to tell you more about it so fa is a rare and Progressive disease to break it down a little bit if they only affects 15 000 people in the world which is one in 50 000 people in the United States so there&amp;#39;s about 5 000 people in the US that have fa so FAS also Progressive meaning that the symptoms get worse over time so fa starts progressing from the moment of the onsite at bayfx almost every single part of my body accept my cognitive ability so my ability to think and reason is not affected at all ePay has a lot of different symptoms and it&amp;#39;s important to note that not every single symptom affects every single person that has an fa but there are a few that are more common so I&amp;#39;m going to read from those lists because I don&amp;#39;t want to forget any but it is loss of balance and coordination fatigue slurred speech hearing and vision loss scoliosis diabetes and serious heart condition so again like I said not everyone that has fa has every single one of these symptoms for example I don&amp;#39;t experience any sort of Edge and loss and I don&amp;#39;t have diabetes but many people do also it&amp;#39;s important to remember that these symptoms are progressive so they do get worse over time and also even if I don&amp;#39;t experience those symptoms now it can pop up later so at various actually genetic so both my parents carry the inactive Gene and because the gene is recessive I still only had a 25 chance of getting an active version of the gene even though fa is so rare and only 15 000 people have it one in 100 people carry their genes so just a little just coming here I&amp;#39;m not a scientist I am a 19 year old business major so I&amp;#39;m gonna do the best I can here to explain the F-18 DNA meditation causes the limited production of a protein called vertaxin so think of yourself as like a machine and so it reads your DNA in sets of three or 20glutotides so my machine is reading my DNA but it keeps getting stuck on a repeat of a tri-nucleotide called Gia so basically that GAA BP is what&amp;#39;s causing the machine to not be able to produce enough for an accident Fred Jackson is a protein in the mitochondria of the cells so you might remember from biology in high school that the mitochondria is the PowerHouse of the cells so it produces all the energy your cell needs protective&amp;#39;s job is to help form iron sulfur clusters in the mitochondria of yourself and apparently iron sulfur clusters are very important so because my body doesn&amp;#39;t form enough protection because it keeps getting stuck on that tranucleotide the iron sulfur clusters never form which causes the mitochondria of myself to not work properly which causes my cells to die currently there&amp;#39;s no FDA approved treatment or cure for the symptoms of fa scientists are working really hard every single day to buy more now and I really believe that they will find a treatment Arc here so if we want to see the progress of some clinical trials and research going on you can go look at the treatment Pipeline on the project Stacks their research Alliance website while I&amp;#39;m waiting for a cure or treatment I try to keep my body active in order to slow down some deprecaution so that&amp;#39;s it I hope that you learned something today and that wasn&amp;#39;t too confusing I know it&amp;#39;s really hard to follow to learn more about it they can go to carepay.org and also find out some ways you can help on the messenger find a treatment and or care you can also follow me on Instagram at makeitopen.com to keep up with my journey within this again guys so much for watching this video bye [Music] [Music] [Applause]",

General Medical information and does not replace the medical advice of your doctor or healthc care provider if you have questions pertaining to your medical condition ask your doctor or healthcare provider freed r a taxi introduction fredita taxia is a disease that damages your nervous system it affects your spinal cord and the nerves that control muscle movement in your arms and legs the main symptom is a taxia Axia means trouble controlling movements the symptoms of fa can be treated with medicines braces surgery and physical therapy this program explains freed rot taxia it covers symptoms and causes of the disease it also talks about diagnosis and treatment the nervous system together the brain and spinal cord are called the central nervous system the nerves in the rest of the body are called the peripheral nervous system the brain is the command center of the body it lets us think and feel it also receives information and sends orders to different parts of the body orders from the brain travel through the spinal cord from the spinal cord orders travel to the rest of the body through peripheral nerves healthy nerves send and receive messages about movement for example if you want to raise your hand your brain tells your arm in hand to do it healthy nerves also send and receive messages about sensation or feeling if you burn your hand while cooking the nerves in the skin send pain signals to your brain if nerves become damaged they cannot send and receive messages well this can cause problems with movement and sensation nerve damage can happen anywhere in the body important organs can also be affected by nerve problems freed taxia freed reita taxia is also called fa or FDA it is a rare inherited disease this means it has passed from parents to child it causes nervous system damage and movement problems fa usually begins in childhood it leads to impaired muscle coordination that gets worse over time in FA the spinal cord and peripheral nerves become thinner the cerebellum is also affected the cerebellum is the part of the brain that helps control balance and movement damage to the nerves and brain causes awkward unsteady movements it also causes problems with with Sensations in some cases fa causes problems in the heart and spine some people with the condition May develop diabetes fa does not affect thinking and reasoning abilities sponsored by the patient Education Institute www.patient.com over 5,000 videos and interactive tutorials symptoms symptoms of fa usually begin between the ages of 5 and 15 the main symptom is a taxia which means trouble controlling movements other symptoms of fa include difficulty walking involuntary eye movements muscle weakness scoliosis which is curving of the spine to one side speech problems fa can also affect the heart resulting in chest pain heart palpitations shortness of breath most individuals with fa get tired easily they may also find that they take a longer time to recover from common illnesses like colds and the flu people with fa usually need a wheelchair 10 to 20 years after symptoms first appear but many people with the disease can live normal lives in severe cases of fa people become incapacitated they can no longer care for themselves and must rely on others for daily living causes fa is inherited this means it is passed on from parent to child it is caused by a defective or abnormal Gene fa is not contagious you cannot catch it from another person genes tell the body to make certain substances every person has thousands of genes our genes make us look the way we do they also have a lot to do with our health fa is caused by a mutation or change in a gene labeled fxn the fxn gene controls the production of a protein called fraxin fraxin is found in the parts of the cell that make energy if the body does not have enough protexin it cannot make energy this can lead to oxidative stress oxidative stress is when there is a buildup of harm toxins and free radicals in the cells free radicals can destroy cells and can harm the body certain cells are affected by the lack of fraxin these include cells in the brain heart muscle peripheral nerve spinal cord damage to these cells results in the symptoms of fa fa only happens in someone who inherits two defective copies of the gene one from each parent a person who has only one abnormal copy of the gene is called a carrier a carrier will not develop fa but he or she can pass the gene mutation on to his or her children if both parents are carriers their children will have a one and four chance of having the disease their children will also have a one and two chance of inheriting one abnormal Gene and being carriers diagnosis a health care provider will first ask about your child&amp;#39;s medical history in symptoms he or she will also ask about family medical history a physical exam will be performed the healthc care provider will check for balance problems lack of reflexes loss of sensation in the joints signs of neurological problems a genetic blood test is used to diagnose fa it shows if your child has two defective fxn genes other tests may also be done to check for damage caused by fa these include CT scan echocardiogram electrocardiogram or ECG electromyogram or EMG MRI nerve conduction studies treatment there is no cure for fa treat treatment focuses on relieving symptoms of the disease treatment may include medicines braces surgery physical therapy speech therapy assistive devices medicines can be used to treat diabetes or heart problems caused by fa foot deformities and scoliosis can be corrected with braces or surgery physical therapy May prolong use of the arms and legs speech therapists can help retrain muscles in the face and neck this can improve speech and

    "transcript": "hello my name is dr diwan s raja today i will discuss about fabrics atexia what is the definition of fedex atexia fedex atexia is the most common neurodegenerative atexic disorder with loss of posterior column of the spinal cord dorsal root ganglion spinal cerebellar tract pure kinji cells and dented nucleus of the cerebellum the corticospinal tract and large sensory neurons fedex atexia begins in childhood maybe at the age of 4 to 15. it is a rare disease its prevalence is one in 30 000 among white population etiology what is the what are the causes of fedex attacks here this is an autosomal resistive disorder and is associated with expanded gaa trinucleotide repeats in normal individual this repeat is also present maybe from 6 to 27 but in a personal fetix attacks here it may be several hundred may be up to 1700 repeats it is caused by a defect mutation in a gene label fxn which carries the genetic code for the for a protein called fredexin fretaxin deficiency lead to impaired mitochondrial iron homeostasis so mitochondrial function is destruct throughout the body there will be disturbed atp production okay so here is the image here is dr nicholas frederick he was a german physician he first described this disease around 150 years back so we have problem in our dorsal column of the spinal cord cerebellum and the fibers related to that we have the mitochondrial dysfunction also found in the heart there will be maybe cardiomyopathy cardiac arrhythmia and in a significant percentage of pancreas may be affected may lead to diabetes mellitus insulin dependent diabetes mellitus and mitochondria will not work so that there will be disturbed or decreased atp production the powerhouse itself is not working this is an autosomal resistive disorder the unaffected carrier father unaffected carrier mother and these two defective gene go there then one in four children will have the chance to get the disease two are unaffected carrier one is unaffected totally unaffected okay so these are the features of autosomal resistive disease fatigue atexia is an autosomal resistive disorder okay so here we are now clinical feature depending on the site of pathology because it involved multiple traps multiple place of the central nervous system we have many symptoms related to that like that of spinal cord electroplation so we will get some cerebral or dysfunction like this bacteria progressive gate atexia and these arterial person cannot talk desired here because the muscles in the pharynx layings the also around the salt pellet and the face will be non-functional or disturbed function due to spinal cerebellar tract lesion and cerebellum will not coordinate properly they&amp;#39;ll be in coordination of movement because of involvement of the cerebellum corticospinal tract the descending tract that may also that also affect it and there will be weakness of the limb especially lower limb but upper limb may also be affected because of descending tract lesion and there will be babinski&amp;#39;s sign okay the foot will be in dorsiflex position thumb will up and the toes will be fend out posterior columnation loss of position sense vibration sense and absent stress reflexes physical finding of fedex atexia optic neuritis nystagmus that is involuntary oscillation of the eyeball optic neurotic inflammation optic nerve paresthesia tremor deafness vertigo spasticity leg pain arched pellet okay pellet will be arched kyphos scoliosis bending forward bending and side bending both together pescara&amp;#39;s arsed foot foot will be look like an arch hypertrophy cardiomyopathy and fatal cardiac arrhythmia these two are the cause of death in most cases insulin dependent diabetes in 10 to 20 percent of cases so how can you diagnose fedex atexia by electromyography and not conduction study ecg and echocardiogram because we have abnormal heart like hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in cardiac arrhythmia so ecg in echocardiogram is essential sural nerve biopsy so there may be demyelination in this real nerve that now supplies the leg and also part of the food genetic test for the expanded gaa triangulated repeat so it can be done in the blood mri of brain and spinal cord is very essential but brain may not show the obvious feature in mri spinal cord may be narrowed down specifically around the cervical region treatment mostly supported there is no cure no cure for fedex atexia supportive treatment consultation with neurologists cardiologists orthopedics and endocrinologist so concentration with a neurologist cardiologist orthopedics and endocrinologist it is that life is has been decreased and this patient needs support proper medical treatment so it will be supportive management not specific management and exact and there&amp;#39;s a specific management and it is incurable disease we also need physical therapy and occupational therapy and research is going on on possible gene therapy okay prognosis of fedex attacks here what is the problem of prognosis loss of emulation within 15 years of onset of the disease it may come early in certain individual 95 percent is wheelchair bound by 45 years life expectancy is significantly reduced with heart disease because this part this fetus atexia patient is also cardiomyopathy and diabetes mellitus fetus attacks atexia patient will have possibility to have diabetes mellitus around 10 to 20 percent cases so life expectancy is reduced due to heart disease and possible diabetes mellitus okay 95 percent is which are bound by the age of 45 loss of emulation within 15 years of onset of the disease and that&amp;#39;s all about the fedex attacks here if you have any question please feel free to ask me please share the information with

    "transcript": "hello my name is julie greenfield i&amp;#39;m the head of research at ataxia uk and today i&amp;#39;ll be giving a research update on friedrichs ataxia research so to start off with i will give an overview of the talk i&amp;#39;m going to start with telling you a little bit about what a taxi uk does to facilitate and promote research and lead to the progress of research going through various of the tax ck research activities i&amp;#39;ll then move on to talk about some of the developments and new treatments and new approaches that are being used in order to find treatments for free drugs ataxia and i&amp;#39;ll be focusing a little bit on pre-clinical research but mostly i&amp;#39;ll be focusing on research that&amp;#39;s actually progressed to human clinical trials and lastly i&amp;#39;ll tell you a little bit about some of the opportunities that there are to take part in research in the uk so a taxi uk promotes and facilitates research with the aim of finding treatments and making them available to people with ataxia we do this in a number of ways so we for example we fund research projects and mostly this is small research grants to get initial results so that then researchers can go to some of the larger funding bodies to get the larger grants and when we looked at our impact report for 2021 we actually found that for every pound attacks the uk spent on research projects it raised almost six pounds in further funding the taxi research and that is really encouraging news for us it shows that we&amp;#39;re selecting good projects that are being funded by elsewhere following our input and also that the researchers we we&amp;#39;re selecting are actually really engaged in a taxi research and continuing their career in ataxia and making progress another one of the activities that texan kay is largely involved in is organizing research conferences and meetings and these are really important opportunities for researchers from around the world to get together share ideas and help in the progress of research we&amp;#39;ve done this for a number of years with our partners around the world other taxi charities and the next one we&amp;#39;re planning for is in march 2022 the international congress for taxi research and for this we&amp;#39;re partnering with the american organizations fara and naf collaboration really is key to advancing research and this is very central to what a tax uk does so we form a link between researchers and the ataxia community so for example we always facilitate the recruitment of studies and this isn&amp;#39;t only clinical trials but also responding to surveys and collecting very useful information from people with ataxia we very much believe in patient engagement and research and we try and involve people with ataxia in everything that we do from our scientific advisory committee all the way to organizing workshops to get people&amp;#39;s input in designing the best clinical trials and things of that kind we work closely with pharma and biotech companies as well and although sometimes this information is confidential and we cannot necessarily share it we really are doing what we can to help progress encourage involvement in a taxi research in some of the newer companies and assist with the programmes of ones who already have ataxia established programs we help by collecting useful information and providing introductions to experts and and this kind of thing we&amp;#39;re really trying to be involved in engaged in all stages of research right from the beginning so we&amp;#39;ve got the preclinical work going down to the clinical trials leading to the drug approval process and we try and provide as much input as we can when dealing with the regulators and finally the last step being the treatment being available on the nhs so that really even after drug approval there&amp;#39;s quite a lot to be done in terms of trying to make sure that patients actually won&amp;#39;t get access to the drugs that have been approved and we try and be involved in every stage of this research moving on to the actual fa research itself so the aim of fa research what goes wrong in free drugs ataxia there&amp;#39;s a mistake in the frataxin gene and that leads to a reduction in the amount of frataxin protein which has an important function within the cells and once again this reduction in frataxin protein leads to a number of disrupted processes within the cells so you get oxidative stress which is very damaging to the cell you get an increase in iron within the mitochondria which are the energy producing compartments of the cells and where frataxin is found to perform its function you get cell damage you get a disruption and dysfunction of the mitochondria and a decrease in the energy produced so there&amp;#39;s a number of processes that happen downstream of the mistake in the frataxin gene and this means that having got all this knowledge and although there&amp;#39;s still a lot of research i&amp;#39;m going to find out the nitty gritty and the sort of detail of this process it means that we&amp;#39;ve got a number of places that could be targeted to try and develop treatments the first place is by using genetic approaches to actually correct or replace this frataxin gene that has a mistake in it the next point we can intervene is in increasing the amount of the frataxin protein itself and lastly there are many different approaches that can be dealt with trying to target these disrupted cellular processes and i&amp;#39;ll be going through all these different approaches in the next few slides so starting off with the developments in new treatments which involve genetic approaches so looking at the the sort of core uh problem in friedrich&amp;#39;s attacks are the mistake in the frataxin gene so a number of research groups around the world both in companies and in academia within universities are trying to develop gene therapies for free drugs ataxia and that would involve either replacing or editing the frataxin gene i&amp;#39;d like to highlight an example here of the company called novartis gene therapies who recently made an announcement which was positive announcement now this company has actually got an approved treatment which is a gene therapy treatment for another rare neurological condition called sma and that is actually available on in the nhs in this country so that is really encouraging and this company is using a virus as a vehicle to develop the gene this is a very common approach in gene therapy and they have some some promising uh results from their pre-clinical studies in in cell and animal studies and they are now due to submit they have announced that they&amp;#39;re due to submit an investigational new drug application by the end of 2021 and that is an application you need to submit before you&amp;#39;re allowed to actually do a trial in humans and they&amp;#39;re therefore hoping for a first in human trial in 2022 so that is really exciting that there might be a gene therapy trial starting in free drugs ataxia and then on the right here i&amp;#39;ve listed a number of different companies who all have programs developing gene therapies for freedom sysaxia and that is really encouraging to see such a long list a number of different groups looking at this approach and as i said there are also groups within universities who are working on this as well and a tax ck is in fact funding a group in spain looking at gene therapy in friedrichs ataxia as well the next approach as i mentioned was targeting this reduction in the fratexin protein and there are a number of different approaches being used to try and increase this frataxin protein which will hopefully lead to the improvements in the ataxia in in the development of a treatment so there&amp;#39;s been a couple of announcements recently from two companies one is called design therapeutics and they&amp;#39;ve developed a small molecule therapy called gene targeted chimeras and they&amp;#39;ve just announced some positive results from cell and animal studies using this therapy and they then aim to have phase one clinical trial in the first half of next year of 2022. so once again really exciting with this new trial plea planned and the company execu has developed some oligonucleotides which are sort of pieces of dna of rna genetic material that attach to a lipid nanoparticle which targets the mrna and indeed they also have found using mouse and studies and patient cells that they found an increase in the frataxin and an improvement in the mitochondrial function which is this compartment within the cell where frataxin is found to do its function and similarly they aim to do first in human studies in early next year so really exciting developments that have been announced recently for these approaches to try and increase the frataxin level within the cells which is then hope will lead to improvements in the ataxia another approach to increasing frataxin levels is one that&amp;#39;s been going on for quite some time and it was a a program that started a number of years ago by an academic group in in the us and has now been taken over by a company called larimar therapeutics and this is a frataxin replacement therapy so actually introducing frataxin to the cells and the this company have this product called ct11601 and it is a fusion protein with the frataxin and this uh sort of fused protein that delivers frataxin to the mitochondria and we now have some results of the first phase one trials in people with friedreich&amp;#39;s ataxia it was a small placebo control trial with 28 people and they had increasing doses of this this drug by subcutaneous injections and they found that there was an increase in frataxin in all the doses used and there was some good safety which supported continuation of the trial and further trials are now being planned now unfortunately in may this year the u.s regulator the fda announced that there needed to be a clinical hold because of some animal toxicity study data that the company had provided with them and they needed some more information and a report before further trials can start so hopefully this issue will be resolved and hopefully this can progress and be another approach that could be developed into a therapy for free drugs ataxia now another way of increasing frataxin levels which is an approach being used by various groups around the world is a drug repurposing approach so you can take drugs that are already in existence and are being used to um to treat patients with different conditions and repurpose them and see if they work in freedives ataxia and here is one example where this was this has happened and this is a study using calcitriol which is an active form of vitamin d and it&amp;#39;s a study attacks uk funded in spain and they did some cell studies and animal cell model studies and they found that this chelsea trial reached an improvement in mitochondrial function increased cell survival and increase for taxing and they just started a trial last month in spain in 20 people for one year and they&amp;#39;re looking at safety and looking at the effect on quality of life so it&amp;#39;s a small trial but it&amp;#39;s really quite satisfying that the investment we put into this initial study has led to a trial in people and we shall see what happens with that as well and then i wanted to very briefly uh mention helex which is a company who has an artificial intelligence approach but ck is collaborating with them and they&amp;#39;re doing a an fa program where they&amp;#39;re using their ai approach to predict what kind of drugs could potentially be useful in fa based on the disease mechanisms and knowledge that&amp;#39;s already out there and then when they find these predictions they will then test them in uh in cell studies and there&amp;#39;s a talk by helix at the annual conference this year on sunday so i would encourage you to listen to that because it&amp;#39;s very interesting approach more drug repurposing studies that are ongoing a drug called traverine which is an antiviral used to treat hiv and this was shown at some time ago to increase frataxin in cells derived from patients and it&amp;#39;s being currently tested in a phase ii clinical trial in italy to study its safety and efficacy in fa and attack ck are actually funding a project in this group to test drugs that may have a similar structure of function to a travering to see if there&amp;#39;s other drugs that could also be useful in friedrich&amp;#39;s ataxia now moving on to looking at the third approach so we&amp;#39;ve looked at the gene looking at targeting the gene we&amp;#39;ve looked at increasing the levels of frataxin now the last approach that&amp;#39;s being looked at for many groups around the world is look at these disrupted cell processes and trying to find drugs that can actually target one of these places to hopefully lead to an improvement in the symptoms in fa and one of the prime examples one which has shown a lot of excitement around the world is the riata homovoloxylon trial the moxie trial now the rationale for this omnivaloxylone is that in fa you get a dysfunction in the mitochondria and a decrease in the energy as i mentioned earlier and this omav seems to restore the mitochondrial function in fa cell models by activating a particular pathway uh a particular transcription factor called nrf2 which is normally reduced in fa so it&amp;#39;s kind of targeting a particular thing that goes wrong in within cells of fa and this is a multi-center trial um and the london ataxia center was the uk trial site and then there were sites around the world in the us and other parts of the world and the trial has three parts part one two and then an opal legal extension and it&amp;#39;s in adults in people over 16. and i&amp;#39;ll now go over the trial a little bit more detail so part one had 69 people taking part and they were randomly assigned to either omar or placebo in a three to one ratio and this was quite a short study 12 weeks and it was meant to determine the safety and what dose should be used in part two part two is then slightly larger 103 adults and they&amp;#39;re randomized one-to-one omath to placebo and this was again to determine the safety and the efficacy of one particular dose and this was a longer trial it was 48 weeks in only a year and then this was followed by the open label extension so everybody who took part in part one and part two was given the opportunity to be on the omav on the drug and uh and then analyzed and the company&amp;#39;s been analyzing the data from this open label extension as well so the results from part one were released some time ago and were published and they found the best dose to be used they found good safety and they found that there was an improvement in the modified friedrichs ataxia rating scale which is a common rating scale used to measure uh different aspects of ataxia however it was a small study so then moving on to results of part two they were announced towards the end of 2019 and later published and these results showed that patients taking over for the 48 weeks had a statistically significant improvement in their symptoms associated with fa compared to those that were on placebo and this was measured by the m fars and which is this modified free drugs attacks the rating scale and then in may this year there were some further results announced and these were the results of the extension phase and once again they showed some further positive evidence for the effect of omavoloxalone so having all these positive results riata&amp;#39;s obviously been in discussions with the u.s regulators to try and seek drug approval for omavoloxalone and to give a little bit of this timescale in november 2020 the fda the u.s regulators did an initial review of the data from part two and part of the extension and they asked for additional analyses to be done by the company and they also intimated that there may be a need for another trial to gather more data before the drug could be considered for approval in january this year taxi uk supported farah&amp;#39;s campaign to ask the fda and riyadh to consider approval of the drug based on the existing data and this campaign was really successful in terms of the numbers of people the 74 000 people actually wrote in support of this campaign then later in the year as i mentioned in may there were some positive results of the extension phase that were announced and then very recently at the end of september riata made another announcement and it said that they had completed their meeting with the fda which is called a pre-new drug application meeting and that after this meeting they reaffirmed their plans to submit a new drug application in the first quarter of next year of 2022 and they also mentioned that they&amp;#39;re not planning to do a second trial pre-approval um being submitted pre-approval study prior to submission to the fda so the plan is to submit with the data they have and see what the fda says so the hope is that they will approve it but of course we&amp;#39;ll have to see and a taxi case closely monitoring the situation of what happens in terms of drug approval in the u.s and of course we&amp;#39;ll be very keen to get drug approval in the uk of school as well for a taxi uk&amp;#39;s members and supporters and everybody now the next trial i want to talk about was one by a company called ptc therapeutics and it&amp;#39;s with an antioxidant called the tiquinone and they showed some positive results in small phase two trials which have then led to a global phase three trial ongoing this is a placebo-controlled trial in 110 adults and children so this study actually includes children as well and it&amp;#39;s for 18 months they&amp;#39;re similarly using as the primary outcome as a way of measuring the effect of the drug they&amp;#39;re using the modified free drugs the taxi rating scale and this started in december 2020 we&amp;#39;re at taxi uk are actually collaborating with peterson therapeutics via our association with euro atexia and we&amp;#39;re supporting them gathering some data to evaluate the health related quality of life and we&amp;#39;ll be doing this by some interviews so we&amp;#39;re really happy to support them in this program because this is really crucial information that is important at the drug approval and post-approval phase in order to get things uh funded and supported by the national health service so another trial i wanted to mention was one by a company called minorics and they are testing a different drug this is a ppar gamma activator in people with friedreich&amp;#39;s ataxia and this drug is called min 102 and this ppar gamma is a protein that&amp;#39;s found in cells it&amp;#39;s a naturally occurring protein and in fa it can&amp;#39;t work properly so this is the rationale for the study a phase one clinical trial showed that this drug is well tolerated and is able to reach the brain and then in a phase two trial in europe including 39 people there were some results released not long ago showing some promising results for safety and some promising results for upper limb at access and some of the coordination movements of the arms however the primary outcome measure which is what you they had tried to see as a primary um thing to test in this trial uh the changes in spinal cord results were inconclusive and this company is now looking at possibly doing other trials now the another three trials that are ongoing there&amp;#39;s the resveratrol trial which is a naturally occurring compound found in the skin of grapes and this potentially could improve the mitochondrial function and a trial is ongoing in australia with 40 people and this is a placebo-controlled trial and then there are two smaller trials one which started recently in the u.s is nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide precursor trial with 10 patients 10 adults and the other one is artusinate trial which is a phase 1 2 study studying in france with 20 people and an open label so not placebo-controlled trials so there&amp;#39;s a number of trials ongoing and it&amp;#39;s really exciting that all these different approaches to to target different parts of the system to try and develop treatments for free drugs so this is really encouraging now the last thing i want to talk about is of course all the studies we looked at here are ways in which you&amp;#39;re trying to stop the progression or result in improvement of the underlying cause of free drugs ataxia however there are also ways in which the research is moving towards symptomatic relief so some of the approaches we&amp;#39;ve looked at in speech therapy and in physiotherapy approaches the idea there is trying to improve some of the symptoms that people with ataxia are living with and one i want to talk about today is this one which is being studied you know by a group in italy and this is where they&amp;#39;re applying a low electrical current to the scalp and the thought is that this may alleviate symptoms of ataxia the technique they&amp;#39;re using is called cerebellar transcranial direct colorant stimulation attack case funded a study of this stimulation in italy it used a range of ataxias free dry scars msa and the results came out in 2021 and they showed improvements in the sarah scale the icar scale which are a taxi rating scales in cognition and quality of life scores and this is quite a short term uh treatment so you kind of have to repeat treatments but they were really encouraging results the next thing that this team are doing is they&amp;#39;re actually looking at an alternative kind of stimulation which is called transcranial alternating current stimulation and detoxification again funding this trial to look at the steam to look at this particular technique and they believe that this may be more effective than than the transcranial direct current stimulation so we&amp;#39;ll see what happens with these results as well a little different type of approach now lastly i wanted to just touch base a little bit on opportunities to take part in research this is a question we&amp;#39;re often asked what can i do to help in the research process one of the big things you can do is join the fa global patient registry so there are many fa charities including a tax dk do have patient registries of some kind so we do use them to communicate to people with ataxia to let them know about research strategies and trials however some time ago attacks uk came together with a number of patient groups including pharah to build a new international registry the fa patient global registry and this is a global effort to pool information all in one place so making it much more powerful tool for research helps understand the condition helps understand the experiences that people are going through so this is really a useful tool that we would like to encourage people to take part in and here is the link at the moment we have more than a thousand people who have registered since um late 2019 from 51 different countries and meaning you know it really is a truly international effort which is wonderful and very needed for rare diseases such as free rights ataxia very recently this year the charity ndfa senate set up an app for people fa to try and facilitate research another way of facilitating research and their aims are to connect people with fa with researchers who are running clinical trials including virtual research trials so there may be ways in which you could collect data from the app and use it in a virtual way which means that people from all over the world can take part you don&amp;#39;t have to be living in the country where the research study is taking place they aim to empower patients with useful tools to manage their lives provide information education etc and here is the link to the app another study which is very important is the efac study and this is a european multi-site study looking in the natural history of free drugs ataxia and involves patients people with free drugs taxi attending annual appointments and where a taxi rating scales are performed and a number of useful pieces of information are gathered as well as samples taken now within the uk london the london taxi center is the site that is still recruiting patients for this study and the data is importantly being published and being used to design trials so it&amp;#39;s really useful information so if anybody who&amp;#39;s got free drugs ataxia and is willing to help with research effort and travel to london this is a really worthwhile project to be part of and over the years euro ataxia and tax uk have also supported it with some funding and there are also farmer partners um so here are the contact details for the london ataxia center for joining this project now we also publicize a sort of surveys and healthcare research opportunities on our website so at the moment we&amp;#39;re collaborating with google&amp;#39;s ai for social good program and this project uh that google&amp;#39;s doing is collecting speech samples with people who have problems with who have speech difficulties in order to improve their voice recognition technology and things such as google assistant this is another opportunity to help uh develop products that might be useful for people with ataxia and then i&amp;#39;ve mentioned this other survey that we ran and that was a covert 19 and a taxi survey where we asked people who thought they had covered to complete a survey and taxi uk&amp;#39;s medical advisors were hoping to learn more about the impact of covert on people with ataxia and we&amp;#39;re currently analyzing the data and we&amp;#39;re submitting it for publication as well so we&amp;#39;ll let you know how that goes too in terms of clinical trials we know that the european freed rights attacks in nicotinamide trial which has been delayed is hoping to start in january and in the uk they&amp;#39;re aiming to recruit 90 people at this within london and then there&amp;#39;ll be other participants in other european countries so watch this space and importantly do join a taxi uk to be kept informed of all these new research opportunities we inform people via our magazine which is quarterly our monthly e-newsletter social media and we&amp;#39;ve also put information up on our website and here is uh the page of our website where we put information on opportunities to take part in research and you will see here that there&amp;#39;s a specific section for free drugs ataxia and also one more generically on health care studies such as the surveys that we mentioned so thank you very much and i&amp;#39;ll be answering any questions during the conference",

    "transcript": "friedrich&amp;#39;s Ataxia is a rare inherited neurodegenerative disorder that primarily affects the Central and peripheral nervous systems it is characterized by Progressive impairment of coordination and balance as well as other neurological symptoms in this script we will explore the frataxan gene mutations associated with friedrich&amp;#39;s Ataxia the autosomal recessive inheritance pattern of the disease the neuroanatomy pathophysiology clinical presentation diagnostic criteria disease progression neurodegenerative changes fretaxin and iron homeostasis management strategies experimental therapies targeting mitochondrial dysfunction prognosis quality of life considerations and emerging therapies for friedrich&amp;#39;s Ataxia friedrich&amp;#39;s Ataxia is caused by mutations in the frataxin fxn gene this Gene provides instructions for producing a protein called fretaxin which plays a crucial role in mitochondrial iron homeostasis the most common mutation associated with friedrich&amp;#39;s Ataxia is an expansion of a GAA triplet repeat in the fxng leading to reduced expression of fretax and protein this reduction in frataxin levels disrupts the normal functioning of mitochondria leading to Cellular dysfunction and neurodegeneration friedrich&amp;#39;s Ataxia follows an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern which means that an affected individual inherits two copies of the mutated fretaxin Gene one from each parent if both parents are carriers of the mutation there is a 25 chance that each child will inherit two copies of the mutated Gene and develop friedrich&amp;#39;s Ataxia individuals who inherit only one copy of the mutated Gene are carriers of the condition but do not typically exhibit symptoms in friedrich&amp;#39;s Ataxia the cerebellum and spinal cord which play a vital role in coordinating movement and balance are primarily affected the degeneration of nerve cells in specific areas such as the dorsal root ganglia and dentate nuclei of the cerebellum contributes to the characteristic symptoms of ataxia including abnormal gait unsteady hand movements and dysarthria speech difficulties these areas are essential for fine-tuning and controlling motor function and the impairment caused by friedrich&amp;#39;s Ataxia significantly affects patient mobility and coordination in friedrich&amp;#39;s Ataxia a neurodegenerative disorder the underlying pathophysiology primarily involves mitochondrial dysfunction and impaired iron homeostasis specifically a decrease in the expression of a protein called fretaxin leads to dysfunctional mitochondria which subsequently leads to impaired energy production and increased oxidative stress within the cells additionally there is a buildup of toxic levels of iron within the mitochondria further contributing to Cellular damage these processes collectively result in Progressive loss of neurological function and neurodegeneration seen in patients with friedrich&amp;#39;s Ataxia clinical presentation of friedrich&amp;#39;s ataxia generally occurs during childhood or adolescence and typically includes Progressive gait disturbance loss of coordination muscle weakness and sensory abnormalities additional symptoms may include cardiac abnormalities diabetes mellitus scoliosis and dysarthria diagnostic criteria for friedrich&amp;#39;s Ataxia include genetic testing to identify the presence of fratax and gene mutations along with clinical evaluation and assessment of symptoms the age of onset or friedrich&amp;#39;s Ataxia varies but is typically between the ages of 5 and 18 years the disease tends to progress slowly over time with individuals experiencing a decline in motor function worsening coordination and increased disability disease progression may vary among individuals but most individuals with friedrich&amp;#39;s Ataxia require Mobility AIDS and may eventually become wheelchair-bound neurodegeneration in friedrich&amp;#39;s Ataxia primarily involves the degeneration of nerve cells in the cerebellum spinal cord and peripheral nerves microscopic examination reveals selective loss of large Sensory neurons in the dorsal root ganglia and degeneration of purkinje cells in the cerebellum these neurodegenerative changes contribute to the progressive loss of coordination and balance seen in individuals with friedrich&amp;#39;s Ataxia frataxon plays a crucial role in regulating iron levels within mitochondria which are the powerhouses of our cells however individuals with friedrich&amp;#39;s Ataxia have lower levels of frat access this leads to an abnormal buildup of iron within mitochondria the excess iron then produces harmful molecules called reactive oxygen species which result in oxidative stress and damage to cells this disruption of iron homeostasis is a key contributor to The neurodegeneration observed in friedrich&amp;#39;s Ataxia the management of friedrich&amp;#39;s ataxia primarily focuses on symptom management supportive care and optimizing quality of life physical and occupational therapy can help maintain mobility and improve function assistive devices such as wheelchairs braces and adaptive AIDS may be prescribed cardiac monitoring and management of associated cardiac complications is also important genetic counseling can support affected individuals and their families and under understanding the disease and making informed decisions in the realm of friedrich&amp;#39;s ataxia research there is a plethora of experimental therapies currently under investigation to address the underlying mitochondrial dysfunction these novel approaches primarily seek to augment the expression of frataxin a protein that is deficient in this disorder additionally scientists are looking into the use of antioxidants to counteract the harmful effects of oxidative stress as well as employing iron Collision strategies to mitigate iron accumulation within cells furthermore some researchers are exploring methods to Spur the creation of new mitochondria through an intricate process known as mitochondrial biogenesis while these experimental therapies hold significant promise it is imperative to conduct further research and clinical trials to comprehensively assess their safety and efficacy in treating friedrich&amp;#39;s Ataxia the prognosis for individuals with friedrich&amp;#39;s Ataxia varies depending on the severity and progression of the disease the neurodegenerative nature of friedrich&amp;#39;s ataxia can lead to significant disability and decrease life expectancy however advances in supportive care and management strategies have improved the quality of life for individuals with friedrich&amp;#39;s Ataxia multidisciplinary care including physical occupational and speech therapy along with regular medical follow-up can help optimize function and enhance quality of life research continues to explore emerging therapies for friedrich&amp;#39;s Ataxia these include gene therapy approaches to restore frat tax and expression novel pharmacological agents targeting mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress and cell-based therapies to promote neural regeneration while these therapies hold promise they are still in the experimental stages and require further study before becoming available for clinical use in conclusion friedrich&amp;#39;s Ataxia is a complex neurodegenerative disorder caused by mutations in the frataxin gene its autosomal recessive inheritance pattern neuroanatomical involvement pathophysiology clinical presentation and disease progression contribute to the challenging nature of the condition management strategies primarily focus on symptom management and support care aiming to optimize quality of life exciting research and experimental therapies and emerging treatments provides hope for improved outcomes in the future foreign",

    "transcript": "[Music] from the American Academy of Neurology I&amp;#39;m Dr Dana Cora and I am Dr Katie Peters and this is the brain and Life podcast so I know we&amp;#39;ve all been watching the Olympics I know that you&amp;#39;ve enjoyed the Olympics Daniel and I know one thing it does for me is it inspires me to go out there and try to be the best athlete I can be like to a little faster or you know jump a little higher how about you just to move a little bit faster and higher I definitely don&amp;#39;t necessarily go try and spin and flip and do any of those things so they practice hard to do it well and not get hurt and I appreciate that I just try to do a little bit of extra running and get outside yes don&amp;#39;t get hurt that&amp;#39;s the key thing now I know that you enjoy the Olympics um are you planning to watch the Paralympics I&amp;#39;m definitely planning to watch them while I was training at Walter Reed I got to see and cheer on some of the games of the wheelchair basketball I found the opportunities and the amazing athletic achievements by the Adaptive sports program and that Community really uniquely inspiring I&amp;#39;m also looking forward to seeing the wheelchair race while in New York at times either running or watching the New York City marathon I&amp;#39;ve seen Marcel hug and Madison De Rosario speed past us during the New York City marathon and it&amp;#39;s going to be great to see their speed on the streets of Paris yeah I plan on watching the Paralympics also and I was really inspired by this because I got to talk to Helen Carney she is a paralympic equestrian who dazzled us to win three medals at the 2021 summer par Olympics in London England um when she was around the age of 10 she started to learn to ride horses and she just excelled and flourished at it and and unfortunately she did get diagnosed at the age of 13 with a rare genetic neurologic condition called friederick sat taxia that it can affect her balance and gate but she continued to ride and found that with being an equestrian she was able to have sort of better control of her body so I can&amp;#39;t wait to hear her again today and have her share her story with us [Music] hello brain and Life podcast listeners I&amp;#39;m very excited to be joined by Our Guest today Helen Kerney she is a paralympic equestrian who dazzled us to win three medals at the 2012 Summer par Olympics in London England starting at the age of 10 she began to ride horses and she excelled um hence all those Metals um and at unfortunately at the age of 13 she was diagnosed with a rare neurologic condition called friedr SAT taxia but this did not deter her or slow her down and I&amp;#39;m delighted she&amp;#39;s joining us for the brain and Life podcast hello Helen hi thanks very much for having me can you tell us a little more about yourself and where you&amp;#39;re joining us from so I&amp;#39;m B St in irand I&amp;#39;m just out of Dublin I&amp;#39;m 34 years and I&amp;#39;ve been doing the horses for way too long and they&amp;#39;re my claimed Fame that&amp;#39;s wonderful and um could I mentioned equestrian R can you tell us a little more about what that is absolutely so dress is you get a a test that you know about in advance and you know the size and layout of the Arena so there&amp;#39;s eight markers and the test tells you what to do at what marker and then there is five judges that sit around it and Mark based on what they see and some depending on their positions they&amp;#39;ll be able to see different things so it&amp;#39;s h hard enough to get away with doing too much wrong and how do you train the horses everyone is really individual in that for me Fredick well it affects your whole body it&amp;#39;s not like it impacts one limb or one thing especially so in general the horses just have to be sensible and not get offended too easily but I kind of would describe it a bit like everything thing works but nothing works well so I can give a bit of a feel with my legs I can use the rains sometimes I might do a little more or a little bit less than I mean to and that&amp;#39;s why I just find the horses need to be able to not get offended too easily to bear with me and generally in terms of training time really helps a lot of things like that so for instance one of the movements we do we have to H do a free walk and allow the horse to stretch now ideally if you are totally over worried you&amp;#39;d let the rains go a bit longer but because of difficulty with my hands I find it very hard to collect rins back up so I have to lean forward slightly and give them a little bit more room that way but I had one horse that used to get really worried about it I think it meant go really fast and basically time just helped H little by little he started to get the idea but look at that took him the best part of two years to kind of become somewh comfortable with it I feel like that&amp;#39;s not just going to advice about horses but good advice for people take it a little slow and let them let them be a little calm about it that&amp;#39;s great advice and do you have a particular horse you&amp;#39;re you&amp;#39;re riding with right now so yeah I do I have a horse at the moment I&amp;#39;ve been very lucky I&amp;#39;ve had kind of several horses TR the years and the one I have now he&amp;#39;s a great character and I really he&amp;#39;s really good in some respects but I probably it&amp;#39;s fair to say he made a little bit of an Aon judgment with him he&amp;#39;s quite big and in terms of taking him together and stuff the judges maybe aren&amp;#39;t quite happy that we&amp;#39;re getting it quite right and in hindsight I should have seen this issue coming but look at it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s always hard to find them and may maybe it worked out quite well so basically I went through a very bad time with scoliosis surgery and I was off the horses for a long time and because of that I didn&amp;#39;t compete for a while and we had him and I got back out competing and I actually thought he was going to do great and maybe ignorance is bliss even though we didn&amp;#39;t do great maybe it was is a good thing to have him and from my head to think that we would do great even though we didn&amp;#39;t quite quite fulfill that I think that that sounds like a great partnership and you have to sort of deal with each other&amp;#39;s um own challenges what is the horse&amp;#39;s name Benny his P name so most horses are called one thing in the stable and then they have a par name so his par name is sensation but we call him Benny in stable I like I think we should all have a posh name and a in in a stable name I&amp;#39;ll have to think of a posh name for myself so so tell us you did have this wonderful experience of you know participating in the Paralympics it sounds very exciting can you tell us more about just participating and what it meant to you oh gosh what it meant me it was I was amazing in experience so I kind of got involved in 2008 and I saw a few people go to the par Olympics before mine which was to Beijing and I kind of in my head said right that&amp;#39;s what I really want to do I want to go the next time and then I think because of freedrick I really thought okay it&amp;#39;s Progressive so you know London is really a great chance and I&amp;#39;m never gonna have a gam as close to me as London so I probably was a bit laser focused and but things did fall into place right for me like finding the right horse is actually quite difficult and I was fortunate with the way it fell my trainer picked up the horse that I head and he turned out to be amazing but when I wrote him I thought he was horrible he was really different I thought she was not but she was like no bear with me and and she was deed right I&amp;#39;m so glad she did say that to me and you what were sort of some of your favorite aspects about competing I think like with the horses and it being physical it&amp;#39;s really good for me physically in terms of managing symptoms but I also think just in general emotionally being able to do something like that and being get to compete at such a high level has kind of giv I I would describe it as given me a lot of what the dispy takes away it&amp;#39;s going to give me a great reason to get up every day and to feel a good accomplishment and you know things like that well I&amp;#39;m so happy for you you mentioned already that you diagnosed with friederick sat taxia can you tell us sort of how that all happened and when you were diagnosed my diagnosis was when I was 13 so 21 years ago shortly before my diagnose I had corrective surgery for scoliosis and I guess I was a bit slow recovering and there was a few things not quite right and AYSO just picked up on a few things and that kind of one thing led to another and um that&amp;#39;s how the diagnosis happened and are you receiving any particular treatments right now um for the Fredericks h no well the first treatment has been improved in States and now in Europe and oh great but it hasn&amp;#39;t quite come to dland yet I think realistically it will still be another while but it is very exciting that there is treatment out there I think overall I&amp;#39;ve always kind of been very firm and you know move it or lose it um exercise is really important in helping manage things and you know if you don&amp;#39;t keep using things unfortunately you lose them and D help you with that like is it part of that exercise yeah definitely so it&amp;#39;s brilliant for me in a sense that um you know it almost doesn&amp;#39;t feel like exercise it feels like just something I&amp;#39;m doing because that&amp;#39;s what I want but also I think it&amp;#39;s probably been more important to me than I realize because with Freeds and with a lot of conditions H fatigue is a big one and horse riding and that allows you to be physically active without overworking anything and also it&amp;#39;s good for the core stability it&amp;#39;s not so easy always to find and an exercise for your core but that in essence is basically what the horse is it it&amp;#39;s barely a workout for your arms and legs but in terms of your core and helping stimulate balance it&amp;#39;s a good exercise and I&amp;#39;d say that has helped me quite a lot and then also when I was younger I was on my feet much better able to I think the physical exercise of grooming the horses or Ming out or doing those kind of jobs really helped keep me going so much more than I can ever really appreciate and I think that&amp;#39;s a great lesson for all of our listeners I just say Keep On Moving and keep on doing that activity I think that helps and um I didn&amp;#39;t really realize that about the core but I guess that&amp;#39;s true I guess when you&amp;#39;re having to sort of sit up on the horse particularly yourage right with the way your body has to sit on the horse that makes a lot of sense yeah and you don&amp;#39;t have anything behind you and you have something moving underneath you so you constantly even though you don&amp;#39;t realize it end up working things like your glutes or your abdomen just trying to stay on that would be my first step stay on the horse any tips for staying on a horse no it&amp;#39;s a strange feeling and this is not something that is easy to even tell someone but when you have a horse collected and together it&amp;#39;s a little bit easier and how I would describe it do you know when you&amp;#39;re in a car with somebody and you&amp;#39;re in the passenger seat right and they break they don&amp;#39;t fall forward but you do because the movement that happens is unexpected and you don&amp;#39;t realize it but they know because they&amp;#39;re the one that&amp;#39;s that put their foot in The Brak so they&amp;#39;re less inclined to fall forward and same thing when you truly have a horse connected staying on is an off a lot easier CU you&amp;#39;re you know what you&amp;#39;ve asked them you know they&amp;#39;re you&amp;#39;re pushing them out or moving them over or going to turn and it&amp;#39;s a lot easier to stay on when you&amp;#39;re the one controlling that now we all strive to control it all the time and sometimes control is better than other times but that&amp;#39;s in general the end of the game to have Optimum control now we talked about Frick&amp;#39;s a taxia and you mentioned that new drug that&amp;#39;s approved in both Europe and by in the United States um I believe it&amp;#39;s called om Vox alone yeah I know you&amp;#39;re pretty excited about that new agent is there sort of other hopes for the future that you have for Fredick sat taxia definitely um and kind of research ongoing and and the drug is showing good signs of slowing progression but it&amp;#39;s to a varying degree um some reports really good but some might be quite as as postive so they&amp;#39;re still looking at other things and I I think look it may not be in my lifetime but definitely as they make strives towards you know things like gene therapy and that they might in find a way to reverse things as well we&amp;#39;re not at that point yet but hopefully into the future we will be I agree with you I can&amp;#39;t wait for the future and I think that there&amp;#39;s going to continue to be developments and and part of the future is going to be the Olympics and the Paro Olympics so I just want to say Helen thank you so much for this lovely interview thank you so much for sharing your experience and your life and teaching us all about both equestrian and also friedrick a taxia so thank you again so much thank you so much for having me and thanks for for doing this podcast it&amp;#39;s a really great resource for people and it&amp;#39;s nice I&amp;#39;m sure for people to hear different stories and you know find different Avenues in life because I know for me definitely the horses and the direction things have taken me is not one I would have thought of but it it&amp;#39;s given me so much of what the disability takes away and I&amp;#39;m really grateful for helping these [Music] brains can&amp;#39;t get enough of the brain and Life podcast keep the conversation going on social media when you follow at neurod Cora andrain and life mag or visit brain andlife [Music] dorg hello brain and Life podcast audience thank you so much for joining us today I am again Katie Peters I&amp;#39;m your co-host and I&amp;#39;m honored to introduce our medical expert Dr subon he is a board certified neurologist and neuromuscular medicine specialist at the Norman fixel Institute for neurologic diseases at the University of Florida in Gainesville he is a professor of Neurology and has a joint appointment in Pediatrics and so we&amp;#39;re going to learn a lot today about child neurology ology his research involves Interventional and observational projects that also include first in human trials and we&amp;#39;ll discuss that also mainly for genetic neuromuscular diseases such as Fredrick&amp;#39;s ATT taia myotonic distrophy facul scapular humoral distrophy and also spino cerebella ATT Taxas so I just want to say welcome and welcome to the brain Life podcast thank you great now can I give you a short introduction do you mind telling us a little bit more about yourself and where you&amp;#39;re joining us from today yes so as already pointed out at the University of Florida College of Medicine and fixell Neurological Institute I&amp;#39;ve been a neurologist for quite some time and almost all my career uh I was what we call a neuromuscular physician I&amp;#39;ve been a director of the muscular distopy Association clinics for a long period of time and we also have an A taxia Center of Excellence here at UF which I direct together with Dr Burns and I&amp;#39;ve been involved in various forms of celexas for a long time uh my original research interest was in the spinal Cal rxas where I was part of the uh teams that discovered genes for uh several of those early spinal Texas like type 1 type three and type six and have continued my interest in the field of genetic itas and we&amp;#39;ve come long way in the last 30 years where we are now conducting clinical trials of Novel medications in this group of genetic diseases as well as some of the muscle diseases where I have an interest which are very similar that&amp;#39;s wonderful and you mentioned your neuromuscular medicine expert for our audience what conditions are really quote unquote neuromuscular in neurology right so you know um there are many of us in the country who focus our interest on nerves which are the electrical cables coming out of your back into your arms and legs nerve and then goes into your muscles so the way we move we speak we use our hands so there are many disorders that affect muscles uh such as the muscular distrophy and there are other similar disorders that&amp;#39;s the major interest of neuromuscular Physicians the axas on the other hand uh affect uh the balanc part of the brain that we call the cerebelum which sits in the back part of your brain brain uh right uh underneath your neck and head in that area and uh when I started working on a Taxas it was kind of an orphan field uh we did not know who which specialty was going to to see patients with the Taxas and U increasingly in this country now uh the Axia patients are being seen by what we call movement disorder neurologist so I&amp;#39;m kind of a I have a little attachment what a group here but I only see the Taxas and I don&amp;#39;t see some of the other things like Parkinson&amp;#39;s that they see as well so it&amp;#39;s a it&amp;#39;s a it&amp;#39;s an orphan group of diseases that&amp;#39;s gradually coming into focus and exciting things are happening thank you for explaining that to us now we had a um a podcast guest it&amp;#39;s Perry Olympian Helen Kerney and she was diagnosed with Fred&amp;#39;s sat taxia um can you tell us a little more about this specific condition yes so this is a genetic Condition it&amp;#39;s a recessively inherited condition what then means every Gene that one uh gets comes has two copies right one comes from your dad one comes from the mom and for recessive disorder to occur you have to have a bad copy of the gene uh both from the mom and the dad one each if you just have one copy that&amp;#39;s abnormal or mutated as many people call it you don&amp;#39;t get the disease so in free drugs attack you the parents are going to be normal but each of them is carrying a abnormal copy of this Gene that we call fexin but some of the children are going to get the bad copy of fexin both from the mom and the dad so you have a double dose of it then you get the disease because when you have that situation the gene doesn&amp;#39;t work enough to make the protein it&amp;#39;s supposed to make so that&amp;#39;s how the disorder uh originates if you will and the majority of uh patients with fexas start having trouble predominantly balanced trouble when they are between about 8 9 10 11 years of age so right as they&amp;#39;re becoming teenagers uh there is a proportion maybe 15 20% who don&amp;#39;t get the disease till later on in their life after the age of 15 or 20 or 25 sometimes and there&amp;#39;s a small number that have problems even under the age of eight for example so there&amp;#39;s a there&amp;#39;s a wide range of age of onset but the majority will have symptoms by the time they&amp;#39;re about 10 plusus one or two one of the things we have realized is that there is Nationwide if you look at the the the database we have there&amp;#39;s a bit of a delay in diagnosis usually about 3 to four years after symptom onset okay all right and we can talk more about it because uh as treatments become available we would like to shorten that time to diagnoses what diagnostic tests are you using to evaluate for free drinks a taxia right maybe I should paint a quick picture of how these children particularly the children get diagnosed lot yeah a lot of times uh you know the children the parents get worried because the children uh the child is a little bit clumsy fidgety um doesn&amp;#39;t seem to be able to to keep up with the with their peers when they&amp;#39;re seven or eight they may be falling a bit more easily a lot of times they end up in the pediatricians clinic and generally at least the this is my maybe not well informed but my guess that pediatricians like to be reassuring to parents uh they they don&amp;#39;t want to go and also this is a rare disease so this is not in their radar so they talk about let&amp;#39;s wait and see what happens you know and U but if they see the child back in a few months uh the child is clearly more stumbly so there is a a decline and that should tip off the people that there&amp;#39;s something going on and typically the patient may be referred to a neurologist like a pediatric neurologist sometimes these children a lot of times they have a foot deformity they end up being referred to an orthopedic surgeon because of the foot problem and a substantial number are picked up even during school exam as having scoliosis in their spine even before the onset of symptoms of redu taxia so it takes a while for them to end up with pediatric neurologist and pediatric knowy are pretty skilled at making a diagnosis of rexia they find that the children have trouble with feeling things in their legs particularly what we call position sense these children have poor ability to figure out where their joints are they often lose their reflexes when they tap them with the with a hammer and then uh they have abnormal nerve conduction which is not a very pleasant test but that&amp;#39;s one thing we see occasionally though because of that because the the peripheral nerve is affected before the cerebellum so both the cerebellum and the peripheral nerve are affect affected by this disease sometimes early on a little bit of a misdiagnosis happens they they think of this as a hereditary neuropathy for example there&amp;#39;s a condition called Shar Mar too disease CMT and that&amp;#39;s often a misdiagnosis for a short period of time before the Pediatric neologist stumble onto the idea that this is free Dres but I would say that&amp;#39;s not very common most pediatric neologist can recognize and diagnose this disease the one other thing is of course the ultimate confirm of diagnosis comes from analyzing the gene for the freed Dres mutation now the fre Dr mutation is one of uh maybe 50 or 60 I cannot keep up in the numbers growing list of uh conditions where the genetic mutation is called a repeat expansion so what that means is that these molecules that make up the DNA um they kind of uh occur in a in a repeated fashion in many parts of our genes even in normal people so we all have for example the repeat uh that is involved in Fred Axia is called GAA repeat in the gene which is called fexin normal people have uh fewer than I believe 44 repeats but patients with fedaia will have much longer repeats certainly usually about 66 or more in both copies most of the time and that causes the disease the reason I bring that up is to detect this kind of repeat expansion you need a specific test that looks for the repeat expansion and many other Gene tests that are currently available which are often commonly used in genetic conditions called sequencing tests do not detect the free Dr mutation so there&amp;#39;s sometimes a delay because a wrong test was asked for at the genetic level so there are few reasons why these children tend to have a little delayed diagnosis but we would like to shorten that also once you diagnose a a child or a teenager or whatever age what are really the immediate priorities like now I need to manage this patient I need to help them what is the first thing you do well again uh let&amp;#39;s just talk about the 70 80% that are children teenagers and then into their teens they do have declining balance of course the one of the major help they need is with their mtor abilities as you know there is no currently medication that dramatically makes the motor abilities uh come back to normal uh take it away completely but we&amp;#39;ll talk about the approved medication that seems to to help the mot abilities in a minute they may need appropriate Rehabilitation Physical Therapy occupational therapy at that time and help with their schooling uh if need be you know like adaptive uh methodology in school information to the education system about the handicaps these patients are facing now they are very smart these kids are don&amp;#39;t have a learning problem but they may need some help with their moral problems in handwriting and things like that we call it a multi- systemic disease so the mutation certainly causes problems in other parts of the body one of the key ones is the is the heart so there is what we call a cardiomyopathy unfortunately Physicians like to use obscure words for simple things so cardiomyopathy simply means trouble in the heart and we find that at this age uh when it begins probably 40 50% may have it uh may have an abnormal echocardiogram which is a common test to be done so these patients require a cardiologist to see them on a regular basis because uh they can pick up these abnormalities spinal deformity is often seen in this childhood age group in a substantial number of these children and it causes pain uh it causes probably adds to their balance problem a little bit because they have a scoliosis so Orthopedics need to be involved in the care of these children and watch the spine and there are certain numbers on the spine X-Ray when they see that they may want to say let&amp;#39;s maybe we correct it a lot of times they may use a brace to uh prevent the scoliosis from getting worse so Orthopedics and Rehabilitation and Cardiology care are very very important I completely agree with you that it sounds like it really takes an interprofessional multidisiplinary team to really take care of these great paat patients and and to you know have them maximize their quality of life now our paralympian guest Helen Kerney she actually became an equestrian and won medals at the par Olympics and I think that&amp;#39;s just so inspiring are there certain strategies like exercise and Rehabilitation that you recommend for your patients right so um certainly physical therapy and occupational therapy directed that the legs and the arms and maximizing function because ptn OT Personnel are they&amp;#39;re not like they&amp;#39;re not like neurologists they don&amp;#39;t care what their reflexes look like they are involved in function how can we make the function better so that&amp;#39;s very important many places maybe less so in the US uh and it may be worthwhile pushing the Physicians to get an you know occasional inpatient intensive rehab might you know improve function the the thing about physical therapy and and occupational therapy is often the function will improve for a short period of time but then it&amp;#39;s going to decline and then you had to do it again and at each point in time you may have to expect some improvement in general we have come to recognize that um aerobic activity in addition to routine type of balance training Etc is important aerobic exercise has probably a protective role for many aspects of your health including your brain health and as you know the AMA recommends 150 minutes of aerobic activity per week speak for I guess for adults but I guess most teenagers and over over over that age can try to perform aerobic activity like 30 minutes a day for 5 days a week or something like that you know a lot of times children and teenagers and youngsters with balance problem can do stationary bikes or swimming and things like that under supervision may be useful for that coming back to your story about Miss Kerney we have another spokesperson that works with our Patient Group that just went on a trip to the Himalayas on a tricycle he&amp;#39;s 40 plus I think the free rides and many fre Dres people already know his names but I won&amp;#39;t say it but probably it&amp;#39;s on the website so people can do a lot of things with free Dres with regard to exercise I would say if you&amp;#39;re seeing a cardiologist let them know that you&amp;#39;re going to do some aerobic activity and how much your heart rate and go up just make sure that they understand what you can do well that sounds exciting I mean the Himalayas I can&amp;#39;t even imagine I I don&amp;#39;t know if I can do that right now so I I appreciate sort of the drive and the commitment of these patients now there is some new exciting research in this area for patients with um friedrick can you sort of share with us sort of the the trials you&amp;#39;ve been involved with and really what is happening in the research Arena yeah I think the research has been very exciting and I think one of the uh exciting things about these genetic diseases once you know that this is the gene that&amp;#39;s uh that&amp;#39;s causing the disease then you&amp;#39;re able to trace uh what is happening in the system in your cells in your brain to bring about the disease from so from the gene to the disease kind of you can work it out fairly quickly of course the gene was found about 30 years ago so 30 years is still kind of quick in terms of medical developments so we know that this Gene the protein it makes called fexin is deficient It&amp;#39;s Not absent but it&amp;#39;s not it&amp;#39;s probably less than 30 to 20% of normal uh okay and we know that if you completely lose fexin you&amp;#39;re probably not going to live it&amp;#39;s supposed to be not compatible with Life but the fexin works in these inside the cell inside what we call mitochondria and this is what I call the the furnace of the cell where all the carbohydrates and fat you eat that&amp;#39;s where it gets burned and the fexin has a role in making some key proteins and enzymes that handle uh the the fat and the carbohydrate to make energy so we think that when you have deficien of rxin your ability to generate energy from all the food you eat is actually reduced and that&amp;#39;s probably the reason why you get nerve cell loss and heart cell problems and so on and so forth to get the disease at the same time this kind of problem in this metabolism within the mitochondria generates what we call oxidative stress that&amp;#39;s a word many people hear all the time the idea that the oxygen that you&amp;#39;re using in your mitochondria in your metabolism for very short periods of time can become kind of toxic or harmful to your cells early work for treatment trials used what we call antioxidants these are all around the place many of the nutrients on Amazon for example are antioxidants coenzyme Q10 I mean vitamin E so we know of a lot of antioxidants some of these were tried were not very helpful we realized that the freed DRS tissues do not defend themselves against oxidative stress and this recently approved drug which is called omon in the laboratory was able to kind of Kickstart the defense mechanism of of oxidative stress in Freed&amp;#39;s cells uh and basically it it pushes the cells to make molecules that uh fight against oxidative stress and it was a nice feeling to see a the first trial in freed Dres to have a positive result where the results seem to keep up with what we predicted it will do uh so it certainly seemed to have a slowing down effect it is not something that will you know completely get rid of everything but what we saw was that patients who were taking aalon in the trial it was 48 weeks uh did perform better in based on a neurological scale compared to the people who are not taking the drug and then we did other kinds of analysis on the same data we had followed these patients for four five years in the trial and we looked at the patients who got on the drug later on after their Placebo experience they were put on the drug and also compared them with what we call a natural history data set we have been collecting information on Free DRS for a long period of time what happens to to the children and patients year by year and we could compare them with that group in all these analysis uh patients who were treated with omav u appeared to slow down a little bit compared to the placebo and non-treated patients over a period of year they probably had a rescue that&amp;#39;s worth about one year of progression that would happen naturally so if that makes any sense so they did not decline by the amount that they would have declined over one year that&amp;#39;s what led to the approval of I I would say that there are more exciting things because the current research scenario is actually uh directed at the gene itself oh interesting so how can we make more fexin even when they have the mutation and two two studies are already phase one early phase trials one is actually to put the protein back by injecting it under the skin pretty much like insulin is given for diabetes uh except to get the protein into the brain is a bit more difficult bit more complicated perhaps we don&amp;#39;t know we&amp;#39;re just beginning that study so this is the ability to take the fexin normal fexin and engineer it in some way because if you just inject it it&amp;#39;s not going to get anywhere but this is engineered in such a way that it&amp;#39;s able to get into various cells in the human body and and and be able to hopefully correct the fex deficiency that&amp;#39;s very exciting very clever people in the laboratory also have designed um synthetic molecules that&amp;#39;ll go to the gene itself to the to the DNA and be able to based on our understanding of how genes are regulated uh these molecules are able to push the the production of the fexin gene to a higher level even when they have the mutation it&amp;#39;s like Brute Force pushing it through the block that the gene has if you if that makes sense so that also is an early trial so these are very exciting things because these will hopefully if they are able to bring the fexin level back to about 50% and and that&amp;#39;s another interesting thing because the the parents who are carriers have only 50% of protection compared to normal people but they do okay so if you can get the protection up to half normal you be you&amp;#39;re going to be okay from what we can see so that&amp;#39;s the aim of these kind of drugs to bring the fexin up and you would think that if you&amp;#39;re able to do that it should have a tremendous effect on the disease for you&amp;#39;re giving us so much hope I mean and I just would have to say those those children and those parents are so brave you know to go into those studies that are you know first in human so that go from like a the mice into the human so I think that that&amp;#39;s you know fantastic and and for our Frederick&amp;#39;s patients just getting to 50% you know it&amp;#39;s like crossing the Finish Line just to get to that 50% of that Gene yeah I mean I I would also say you know having dealt with the with the families and patients it&amp;#39;s a tremendous group of patients and families and they fight for it and they&amp;#39;re extraordinarily courageous and they come for studies and the free drug attx research Alliance which is the patient support group has done a tremendous job of pulling people together and acting as a link between patients family clinicians research groups and Industry and Regulatory people so this whole work can move forward in a very concered orchestrated fashion well Dr um Saron I think that um you&amp;#39;ve just done so much to help this patient population and To Be A Champion for them I just want to thank you and to thank our listeners um and I look

    "transcript": "hello everybody Welcome to voices of friedrich&amp;#39;s ataxia our goal is to raise awareness and funds to cure friedrich&amp;#39;s Ataxia fa today we will talk about how heart problems are treated in FA for mitochondrial cardiomyopathies including free drugs we may not have a cure but we have multiple drugs that seem to help prolong life and maintain some function when used in combination in general we treat mitochondrial cardiomyopathies like free drugs based on analogy to other types of hypertrophic cardiomyopathies where the drugs seem to work unfortunately we&amp;#39;re not really sure yet what works in free drugs one concern I have is that many fa patients get put on beta blockers drugs that decrease the force and rate of heart contractions because that standard therapy for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy there are no clinical trials examining the use of beta blockers in friedrich&amp;#39;s ataxia most patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy who don&amp;#39;t have free drugs Ataxia can still relax their hearts they usually have good blood flow into the heart unless their hearts are really thick and they don&amp;#39;t have stiff hearts with a lot of scar tissue which may be a problem for patients with free drugs ataxia the average person with non-fed reaches Ataxia hypertrophic cardiomyopathy may have a higher than average heart rate but they don&amp;#39;t have to increase their heart rate that much however if the heart has to speed up to accommodate the fact that it can&amp;#39;t fill with blood such as in friedrich&amp;#39;s Ataxia then if you slow it down with a beta blocker the cardiac output drops and these patients will have problems they feel bad and don&amp;#39;t have any energy so I would urge cardiologists not to reach for the beta blockers as a first-line therapy for these hearts instead one of the things they may want to consider is lowering blood pressure without hurting heart performance that can be done with drugs called ACE inhibitors like captopril or enalopril which make the hearts work easier by dilating blood vessels and lowering the pressure against which the heart has to push to pump the blood out some patients will be put on digoxin a drug that increases contractile Force which may make the heart perform a little better digoxin also helps control arrhythmias other anti-arrhythmic drugs cardiologists might use include a myodoron or flaccanide you have to treat the specific type of arrhythmia this information was taken from MDA with their permission their link is provided in description",

we&amp;#39;re focusing on Hobby Sports lifestyle I am Kellen Madden I&amp;#39;m fah patient engagement manager and I have three faers on the stage with me here who are all going to tell you guys a little bit about what they do to bring joy to their lives and to bring purpose to their lives so if we can move on to the next slide I don&amp;#39;t can I do that with this thing let&amp;#39;s see yeah okay that&amp;#39;s cool I like that all right this was the title we we just went over the title all right so first up we have Alex do you want to tell us a little bit about yourself all right my name is uh I&amp;#39;m Alex holiday um I live in Florida I am 20 years old and I&amp;#39;ve been living with f since I was 5 years old and what are you gonna be telling us about today Alex we can kind of see you on the slides I will be telling you about um cooking if it&amp;#39;s not evident from the slides thanks Alex all right next up we have Anna sorry we&amp;#39;re not sitting in the order of the slides I made but we have Anna next on the slides hi I&amp;#39;m Anna um I live in a suburb right outside of Philadelphia um I recently turned 18 and I was diagnosed with f um n years ago um and my hobby is archery thanks Anna and then rounding it out we have Kelly hi I&amp;#39;m Kelly Gregor can you guys hear Kelly hi I&amp;#39;m Kelly Gregory I&amp;#39;m from Central Minnesota I&amp;#39;m 25 years old I live with my husband and our dog and cat and I was diagnosed at 13 I&amp;#39;m going to be talking about not really my hobby it&amp;#39;s more of a lifestyle but um I&amp;#39;ll be talking about health and nutrition and exercise thank you all right um so I think we&amp;#39;ll just go down the line and have each of you just tell us a little bit more about your hobby maybe you can tell us how you first or for Kelly lifestyle how you first got into it Alex how did you first get into cooking well I would say um when I first got into it um yeah um looking back at um you know my um family especially my dad&amp;#39;s mother through all the time and you know I&amp;#39;m also not look it but I&amp;#39;m Italian so um we like to feed people um and and so I just uh one day I don&amp;#39;t know probably about six seven years ago just decided that I was going to start buing around and um and um cooking up and making recipes for different things and um I figured out I had an extra I had a passion for it and it and it just grew from there and um about one to two years ago I uh was looking online for um different things like how to make cooking safer and easier for people and I threw looking online I realized there wasn&amp;#39;t much out there so I decided to start my own YouTube channel um that I call the handic capable Chef um that uh to that&amp;#39;s dedicated to helping make cooking uh safer and easier for well for all people but for mostly disabled people like myself thanks Alex Kelly do you want to tell us a bit about how you first got into Fitness and Nutrition so when I was first diagnosed there wasn&amp;#39;t really anyone on social media saying anything about projects taxia so anyway uh a few years ago I decided to start conquering fa on Instagram and share like my health and fitness tips because when I was first diagnosed like kind of just feel alone like there&amp;#39;s no one like you and I don&amp;#39;t want other people to feel like that so I decided to share my life and the two main things that you you can control with fa to slow your progression are your nutrition and how much you exercise so I decided to dedicate my life to all aspects of health and nutrition um to try to control and slow my progression as much as I could thank you and Anna how about you and archery how did you first get involved um so I was diagnosed with that b when I was eight and at the time I played a lot of sports like softball and dance um and even years after my diagnosis I was still able to do those things um but as my symptoms progress um that became harder for me and so I started archery when I was in Middle school and I&amp;#39;ve played on and off since then um but I&amp;#39;ve been like really consistent and the past um like three years of my high school um career so thank you so for Anna and Kelly both of you guys it seems like the fa diagnosis eventually LED you to to archery or to Fitness and Nutrition is that correct right and Alex how about for you were you into cooking before you had fa did it did that interest come about after your diagnosis um I I mean you were diagnosed pretty young so probably after it didn&amp;#39;t really I noticed anything until like I said about six seven years ago and I decided to try it but looking back on live I mean I&amp;#39;ve several things throughout my life um when I was in elementary school I had a uh project for one of my class where I had to make a uh make a meal pretty much by myself when I was like seven seven or eight and I would really enjoy enjoyed it or when I was in or when I was in like seventh grade um they had us make a uh a model of a cell out of whatever we wanted do and I decided that I want to do um big big some brownies because I wanted some food so I I mean although cooking has been I&amp;#39;m part of my I&amp;#39;m food has been very important in my in my life oh I mean like I said um uh Italian I mean we like food yeah you&amp;#39;re kind of bored into that in an Italian family um do you remember what meal you made for school when you were seven or eight um no not really I don&amp;#39;t I don&amp;#39;t remember from childhood no that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s fair okay so I think we can learn a little bit more about like what what does an average day in the life look like for you guys in terms of what your interests are um since Alex just answered why don&amp;#39;t we start at the other side of the table Anna do you want to tell us about like how frequently you&amp;#39;re doing archery can you only do it during certain times of the year things like that um yeah so I go one the week um I go all year um and it&amp;#39;s one onone with my coach um and it depends if it&amp;#39;s warm outside then we go to the outdoor ranges which I really like um because cool me um and then in the winter we go and do it in the indor ranges so and so you said you do it one-on-one with a coach and it&amp;#39;s not not with the team at school is that right awesome Kelly how about you you you&amp;#39;ve already said that Fitness and Nutrition is more of a lifestyle to you so what is an average day in your life like in terms of how you incorporate Fitness and Nutrition in I would say like for an average day I mean I either have help like home cooking all my meal most 99% of my meals and every once in a while I&amp;#39;ll eat out but usually I homecook like some nourishing meal uh for breakfast and then like a meal prep for lunch go to work come home and then I incorporate my exercise routine and then meal prep supper or not not necessarily meal prep supper probably just as like a meal food prep pepper and your your job is also connected to Fitness and Nutrition is that right yes so I am a certified personal trainer and I also have my certification in nutrition and group fitness instructor and then I also teach silver sneakers which is like exercise for elderly people um and then yeah that&amp;#39;s my uh work cool do you have like what kind of group fitness classes do you teach all sorts of them um some are like for Silver Sneakers it&amp;#39;s mostly seated exercises and some understanding stuff and then that we just keep getting more and more advanced during like different classes are more advanced than others so cool um Alex what about you I think the last time we talked it was more of a like weekday versus weekend thing for you in terms of what you&amp;#39;re cooking yeah um I would say mo most weeks um pretty much um every day will uh figure out um based on what we&amp;#39;re having for dinner that night what um marinade to make for the meat and then and that&amp;#39;s that in the afternoon and then when my parents get off they help me with the actual part of uh so I don&amp;#39;t burn myself with putting it in the oven or putting it on the grill um and then the I don&amp;#39;t do it often but on the weekends is when if when my mom or dad help me make more complicated things like my meatballs or tacos um and you know and then also I mean out there is but um we&amp;#39;re huge football fans and so H we uh every football Sunday um we put on a whole spread of food the entire day that we just graze off of the entire day Wing like wings tacos other good stuff like that so oh H it&amp;#39;s a typic difficult day of my cooking is this might be a hard question do you have a favorite thing to cook a favorite meal it is hard but have say I that that um I would say two of my favorite thing that just said are um uh I think I make really good tacos um and um I mean I um like uh my making my meatballs um my uh I&amp;#39;ve had many requests especially from my grandfather my mom&amp;#39;s father who is 100% Italian um for for he like keeps requesting that he wants my meatballs for his birthday wow that&amp;#39;s High Praise so I would say the those would be my h two favorite things to make all right so if any one in the audience ever visits Alex ask for the meatballs okay um and so you said your parents sometimes help you with certain tasks like putting things into the oven are there any other modifications that help you cook any tools or things like that that you would recommend to someone else with fa who is starting to cook yeah I use um a lot of tools um I demonstrate um some of them on my uh YouTube videos but but I one thing is um chopping can be hard for like Bearer thing so I use a food processor and um but when I do like to cut things I use like cut res resistant gloves so I don&amp;#39;t cut off my finger cuz I&amp;#39;m clumsy or and um you know I use a also when I&amp;#39;m cutting I use a a uh anti- slip mat so The Cutting Board will stay where it is the entire time so I don&amp;#39;t have to fight with the cutting board moving all around because that&amp;#39;s how you cut yourself too yeah I&amp;#39;m I&amp;#39;m glad you have all your fingers um Kelly what about you what types of modifications do you make to help either with your your job or just you you know your own personal fitness goals and things like that so it&amp;#39;ll be a little Side Story and then I&amp;#39;ll answer you yeah love a Side Story when I wanted to become a personal trainer I really doubted myself at first like I was thinking who wants a trainer that&amp;#39;s in a wheelchair and that&amp;#39;s what I thought until I talked to this one lady one time and she probably has no idea who I am but she made such an influence on my life that she said well who cares that you&amp;#39;re in a wheelchair like you you still can get all the certification and have all the knowledge and everything um and that that changed my perspective so I decided that I did want to pursue pursue doing personal training and nutrition um as my job and when I do have struggles like and I can&amp;#39;t show a client a certain workout I have really good co-workers that I film and then I show my clients the the footage of people so that I&amp;#39;m still able to instruct them verbally but then they can see a video of what the exercise looks like and then in my own training I usually do seated workouts or like seated on the floor a lot of floor exercises and then um also some workouts that or some exercises that I can do from in my chair as well great and Anna what kind of modifications do you make if any for archery I think you already said you chose archery specifically because it is accessible to you um so I use a wheelchair and I do archery in my wheelchair so um like sitting and making sure I&amp;#39;m not hitting like my chair with the bow or um like the ground um and then I also um have to make sure the height differences are like worked out so like um the target isn&amp;#39;t too high so not like I don&amp;#39;t know or too low so not like shooting over the target but um yeah so and did it take a good amount of time learning what adjustments you needed to make before you figured out what worked for you um a little bit it definitely took a while um for me to learn like the height differences like I was saying but um yeah cool all right so we have a couple more questions for our panelists um I think I&amp;#39;m I&amp;#39;m really excited we&amp;#39;re having this panel be and the travel panel we had earlier as well because it&amp;#39;s just so important to make time to pursue things in life that bring you Joy and that can also help with things like mental health and well-being because you have those things that make you happy and Pursuits and goals so I&amp;#39;d love it if you guys could talk a little bit about why your interest or your lifestyle is important to you and how does it bring you Joy Alex do you want to tell us a little bit about cooking for you okay no I mean I would say it&amp;#39;s important to me because it just make me um happy in it excited seeing someone um try try my food and um whether they like it or not and and I know it sounds crazy um some of you but I so strangely when I&amp;#39;m cooking is um I I just naturally feel calm even if a bunch of chaos is going around on around me I just strangely feel at peace um so just it&amp;#39;s important to me to um to just make people make people happy and that that&amp;#39;s what uh cooking cooking does for me and let me see if how happy I make people with my food that&amp;#39;s really nice um do you have any memories about I maybe it&amp;#39;s your grandfather and and the me policy request but do you have any memories specifically about a time you cooked for someone and and it brought you that Joy because they were enjoying it I mean I mean oh I just love it like all time but I would say um one other specific memory it is with my grandfather but it is not about the me balls um it was my grandfather um obviously um my grandfather um had a mother who cooked homemade Italian for him when he was growing up so for his 70th birthday um my grandfather wanted me to make him a um Chi uh chicken ctory cuz he hadn&amp;#39;t had that since his grandma made it for him when he was a kid and so seeing him have that for the first time in years and enjoying it was uh pretty was pretty special and it brought me lots of Joy knowing that it brought him a lot of joy and memories from when he was a kid that&amp;#39;s really awesome so you&amp;#39;re kind of Contin a whole family Legacy through the cooking that you do and bringing those memories back to your loved ones as well uh yeah a a little bit I can do um I&amp;#39;m trying yeah I it seems like you&amp;#39;re succeeding to me thank you Alex um Kelly do you want to tell us a little bit about what type of Joy Fitness brings to you Fitness and Nutrition yeah so I like when I was younger I hated working out absolutely hated it and it was because all my doctors told me you have to work out you have to do this to keep up your strength and I just I I didn&amp;#39;t like it um took me a couple years but I changed my mindset from I have to do this to I&amp;#39;m able to do this so I then I I started to love working out and I wanted to show others especially those with f a but or just like regular people so I started my um my Instagram going back to that and demonstrating all my different workouts that I do and then um like all what vitamins I was taking and different tips on how I would make a working out more accessible to me and I was getting a bunch of people like messaging me saying that I helped them and they they showed that their showed their physical therapist something from my work from my um videos and how much should help them and that brought me so much joy that I could help people and that was my goal was to help others especially those with f to help them not feel alone and then also to help them to learn to live a healthier lifestyle but that became sounds weird but it became not good enough for me I wanted more of a inperson thing um to feel that Joy like I still love posting UNC conquering F and getting all the messages from people but I wanted more of a personal connection to people that I was helping and that&amp;#39;s when I decided to do personal training and like a one-on-one client that I could see in person and also the same with nutrition that that I can help them one in one because that really brings me joy helping other people um and then another portion of the story I it also brings me joy that I can personally help to slow my progression by nutrition exercise cuz odds are you&amp;#39;re going to progress no matter what so one thing that I can control is my nutrition and exercise that I&amp;#39;m doing and that can help to slow your progression so I really really took off and ran with that well wheeled away with that so and do you want to talk about the videos you shared with me now not yet all right all right we we can wait till the end we&amp;#39;ll wait till the end it&amp;#39;s they&amp;#39;re good videos so we can end with that um Anna do you want want to tell us a little bit about why archery brings you Joy or how it brings you Joy um so archery is really important to me because um I like it and I think it&amp;#39;s fun and um I have a good time doing it it teaches me patience and how to maintain a positive um mindset and um yeah and my coach is definitely strict um but she is really encouraging at times um and yeah she um she knows a lot about the sport and she um tries to make it the most fond and accessible it can be for me um she actually went to the Olympic trials this summer and coached archery there and she met Snoop Dog and she show me she show me pictures of that so I thought that was cool but um yeah what what do you think she would have preferred like going on in the trials or meeting Snoop Dog I don&amp;#39;t know it&amp;#39;s hard competition between the two I don&amp;#39;t know um can you tell us more about what you meant by keeping a positive mindset and how that relates to archery um so yeah so it teaches me like patience and like how to maintain a good mindset like um R like maybe I won&amp;#39;t get it on the first few tries um but eventually I can and it gives me something to work toward um like being successful and getting the best like getting close to Ball&amp;#39;s eyes and stuff yeah I guess archery is very unique as a sport because you can kind of immediately assess how well you did each each time you take a shot so you&amp;#39;re talking about remaining positive even if You&amp;#39; had a few a few bad runs and keep looking towards your next shot is that what you&amp;#39;re saying yeah yeah that makes sense all right so we have one last question um for the panel and then we can open it up to the audience to see if you have any questions or I can also make up more questions um can you guys tell us um what advice you would give to someone else with fa or someone else with any type of disability who is thinking about pursuing a hobby or an interest or trying to figure out how to bring more joy into their own lives what advice would you give them about pursuing that Alex you want to start us off okay um well first I would say um first thing is like find what um gives what gives you as the individual uh great Passion cuz you know like me it&amp;#39;s cooking Kelly is it&amp;#39;s uh Fitness and Nutrition and for and it&amp;#39;s archery so it&amp;#39;s is everyone can have doesn&amp;#39;t have to have exactly the same thing that they that they want to pursue um second thing I would say is um you know whatever that passion is first I would do like I did and look look through Google like no don&amp;#39;t just look once and give up like really do a deep dive on the Internet and try and find something and if there is nothing don&amp;#39;t don&amp;#39;t be afraid to uh do like a lot of us did and um start a start a YouTube series or a or a Instagram page to um to help um get a younger generation um more interested in um that same Hobby or lifestyle yeah that&amp;#39;s good advice good don&amp;#39;t be afraid to be a Trailblazer KY what&amp;#39;s your advice so as it pertains to health and N Fitness and Nutrition I would say that all movement is beneficial there&amp;#39;s a saying use it or lose it with fa that is like 5,000% true use it or lose it your muscles will deteriorate so fast so you might as well try everything you possibly can so yeah advice is all movement is great move it or lose it or use it or lose it sorry um and then like nutrition wise I guess just ask your doctor for advice but or ask your registered dietitian but I would say try to limit processed foods and eat as Whole Foods as you can and make sure you take your vitamins make sure you&amp;#39;re getting wide variety of nutrients colorful food from close as you can to unprocessed and do you have any advice about the pursuit of a hobby or changing a lifestyle or anything like that yeah don&amp;#39;t let fa stop you that stopped me for a long time in my career wanting to be a personal trainer was like it stopped me for a long long time because I doubted myself thinking that no one wants a personal trainer in a wheelchair but it that doesn&amp;#39;t matter if you&amp;#39;re in a wheelchair like you&amp;#39;re still a person you still have all the knowledge you can still be just like a regular person so don&amp;#39;t let F stop you just to overcome it and yeah it&amp;#39;s a lot easier said than or it&amp;#39;s easier said than done but try to have a positive mindset and overcome fa as much as possible thank you Kelly and Anna what advice would you give to someone else with fa who is considering pursuing a new hobby or interest um I feel like I&amp;#39;m stealing Alex and ideas but um just don&amp;#39;t give up and be willing to try new things um because you might not get it on the first try or even the second or even the third but eventually you will just don&amp;#39;t give up always great advice all right so we&amp;#39;re GNA end with some videos Kelly shared if we can go all right and I think if I hit the next button it should play the first video okay I played the second one you want me to play the next one too no just wait I&amp;#39;ll explain this person one first okay so this I had a goal of getting we go fishing a lot my husband and I and I had this goal to get up from the bottom of the boat to the top of the boat by myself so I wouldn&amp;#39;t always be dependent on my husband to lift me up because it it&amp;#39;s kind of hard for him when you pull the boat out of the axis and you&amp;#39;re sitting at the axis and he&amp;#39;s out side of the boat and I&amp;#39;m still inside in the way bottom of the boat so it&amp;#39;s kind of hard for him he&amp;#39;s a shorter guy so it&amp;#39;s hard for him to reach all the way in pull me out and like we weave the same so it&amp;#39;s yeah it&amp;#39;s just it&amp;#39;s hard for him to do it so I wanted to be able to get myself at least up from the bottom of the boat to the top of the boat where it&amp;#39;s easier for J transfer me so I practiced all winter long of doing tricep dips on multiple different levels I have like a bunch of different benches in my house working to get that that same level as the boat um from getting up to the lower L to lower deck to the top deck and anyway I was finally able to do it inside and the first time I did it like actually in the boat I was so like just so happy I was like oh my gosh did you see that I don&amp;#39;t I don&amp;#39;t know why but that was just something so simple that you set your mind to it and you can achieve like something that seems so simple to other people but it&amp;#39;s not uh people with that fate so set your mind to something and go forward and cheap it that&amp;#39;s really cool especially um you had said that when you were younger you didn&amp;#39;t like Fitness because people were always telling you you need to exercise so I imagine most people when they hear let&amp;#39;s do some tricep dips they&amp;#39;re like absolutely not I I don&amp;#39;t want to do that but you showed that there was a very practical application for doing that exercise and it helped your Mobility so that&amp;#39;s really cool thanks for sharing that and then now now can I do the next video I&amp;#39;ll explain it first okay okay so this next video so there&amp;#39;s a backstory behind it and the backstory is why I had so much motivation to do this so I wanted well the backstory so I was um on a vacation and my husband was gone working throughout the day and so I was left by myself in a non-accessible um building and I had to go to the bathroom anyway I ended up falling out of my wheelchair on the floor and I couldn&amp;#39;t get up to go to the bathroom I ended up peeing my pants and then I sat there for 2 hours before someone was able to help me and I told myself that is not happening anymore so I&amp;#39;m going to be able to get from the floor to my chair and that was a huge step because I wasn&amp;#39;t wasn&amp;#39;t able to do it I had tried for for two hours that day crying the whole time because I just pee my pants in a random place and anyway I decided that is not going to happen again I&amp;#39;m going to build up the strength to get into my chair by myself I could get into my chair if I like had a grab bar to help me but in a place that you&amp;#39;re not familiar with they don&amp;#39;t usually have grab bars all over so I decided to work on this every day for for a while and I videotape myself every day and every single day I would end up falling down and anyway that the one day I was able to do it and the actual video I was so happy and can&amp;#39;t play that one because um the actual video had some sore words in it because I was so happy I&amp;#39;m so proud of myself but anyway so this video shows like all the different time well not all of them the video would be like five minutes long but a bunch of different times of meia trying to do this transfer and falling on the floor every time and then finally when I was able to do it and just to see that excitement and my husband he was recording me me from the other side of the room also and I didn&amp;#39;t know he was in the room so so then we got like two different angles and I was just beyond happy so once you put your mind to something you can achieve it even though if it seems impossible at first go ahead [Music] ask so honestly that that like it still brings tears to my eyes and I get little Goosebumps because I&amp;#39;m just like every single time I see that video like I mean and this was months ago that that happened and still it every single time I get so like just so proud of myself that I was able like to accomplish something and I mean this is way more important to me than the the boat transfer because this is like you never know when you&amp;#39;re going to be on the ground and to get it up into your chair so yesterday um I was at the the the gym in our hotel and I did my workout and then still got up into my chair and that just like it proves that you&amp;#39;re you&amp;#39;re able to do a lot more than you think so set your mind of something get out there and do it thanks Kelly and thanks also to Alex and Anna for sharing these parts of your lives and and giving everyone here evidence that you can do the things that you set your mind to um even if you have to make some changes and adjustments along the way and give yourself lots of patience um I hope you never stop feeling proud about that accomplishment and all three of you guys I I hope you can continue doing what you love and finding joy in it and being proud about the things that you do for yourself and that you do for other people I&amp;#39;d love to open it up to the audience if anyone here has any questions for our panelists and the amazing things that they do multiple questions coming I just want to say that you all inspire me greatly thank you for who you are and what you&amp;#39;re sharing it you are amazing yeah congratulations to all three of you for finding your passion because it takes some people their lives to find that and you found it early so um just a couple of comments and then a question so archery did it in high school and I was horrible at it so so I commend you because I can&amp;#39;t even imagine um and as for you know the boat that is really a big deal I come from a fishing family my my son&amp;#39;s passion is fishing and so is his dad&amp;#39;s and um getting yourself up that it&amp;#39;s not just getting yourself up that the boat&amp;#39;s doing this and this and this so it&amp;#39;s a lot harder than most people would think so congratulations that that is pretty impressive actually and then I have a question for Alex where do you get your inspiration for the meals you make do you read cookbooks do you go on the internet do you use family recipes do you just look at all the spices and say hm I wonder if those would taste good together um well it um I would say that often times I look at uh different cookbook I have a lot of good books um and look at a recipe and I&amp;#39;m oh that looks good but I don&amp;#39;t like this so uh a lot of times I&amp;#39;ll and then it&amp;#39;s also like oh we don&amp;#39;t have that in the house so sometimes I would say it&amp;#39;s mostly from uh uh cookbooks Pinterest is also your best friend when it comes to cooking um and then I just a lot of times I tweak stuff um using whatever we have in the house um one thing I did figure out about myself earlier just I I like I have a pretty Keen sense of what uh spices and herbs and other other ingredients um go well together um so it just I I don&amp;#39;t know where it really comes from uh some of it most of it I would say comes from uh from my own mind tinger around with stuff cool have to press we we have another question I think hi my name is Noah I as well but this is a question pretty much for Kelly um I recently gotten into working out and nutrition too but when you have a bad Fa Day like say you don&amp;#39;t get enough sleep or you&amp;#39;re not fully hydrated how do you push through that and stay motivated to still get the most out of your workout or out of your day honestly it&amp;#39;s really hard but I still think that doing something is better than nothing so even if like okay so we&amp;#39;ll just take for instance a couple weeks ago I did not sleep like at all and the next day I was going to work out and I was like it&amp;#39;s going to be a short workout but I&amp;#39;m still going to work out at least some so you&amp;#39;re still getting some movement but I guess mainly just listen to your body but also try to push yourself somewhat cuz you you never regret a workout or unless you get hurt but honestly like I haven&amp;#39;t regretted a workout like cuz the mental Clarity like I don&amp;#39;t know you just end up feeling better after workout maybe not physically but mentally you&amp;#39;ll feel better and then physically you&amp;#39;ll end up getting stronger so or or in our case slowing their progression so did that answer okay Anna Do you ever experience that with your archery having a bad Fa Day um yeah definitely um because of the patients that artery teaches me though um I feel like over time I&amp;#39;ve been able to get more or be more um like open to having bad days and like fine with it I think before when I was in Middle School I used to cry um when I was really frustrated with it um but now I don&amp;#39;t so yeah so it taught you that this will pass and you&amp;#39;ll have a good day maybe tomorrow maybe in a couple days yeah any other questions from the audience there&amp;#39;s bright lights in my eyes so I can&amp;#39;t see everyone I think everyone people there every day getting through it got another question question slash story because I&amp;#39;ve had the privilege to cook with Alex before and I got to tell you that he likes a big meatball he does not like small meatballs he&amp;#39;s very passionate and I got really challenged by him because he didn&amp;#39;t want to make the small meatballs that I was suggesting we had to have the big balls but if you have a chance it it was his passion my passion coalesced for a couple days and we got to cook together and it was an honor about the size of me balls he gets he gets it um my question is uh for each of your um passions do you have like a milestone like a next milestone in mind that like you&amp;#39;re working toward for for it that&amp;#39;s a great question go ahead I hope I answer but you can go ahead okay um so actually uh um my next real milstone that I&amp;#39;m working towards um is um finishing up I&amp;#39;m working on uh writing my own uh cookbook so my next Milestone is getting that getting that finished and getting that published and accomplishment that that&amp;#39;ll that that&amp;#39;ll be because I&amp;#39;ve been working on that for several years now that&amp;#39;s a huge comp thanks for asking that question otherwise we never would have known that that&amp;#39;s awesome okay so my next goal seems a little Out Of Reach right now but it&amp;#39;s not Out Of Reach I will accomplish it I want to be able to do a pullup sounds simple for like regular people like my husband just makes it look so easy and then I&amp;#39;m just even more jealous but that is my goal so I practice like I mean not daily but I practice probably every other day and then once a week I take a progress video um just to see how much more I&amp;#39;m improving not even close right now but at some point I will get there so that&amp;#39;s my goal that I&amp;#39;m working on right now yeah I don&amp;#39;t I don&amp;#39;t maybe I just have really bad upper body but that does not sound like an easy thing to me so yeah that&amp;#39;s going to be awesome Anna what about you um so as a right now um I&amp;#39;m trying to work on having the target farther away from me when I&amp;#39;m shooting right now it&amp;#39;s pretty close um but I&amp;#39;m trying to get it farther away to so that&amp;#39;s what I&amp;#39;m working on but thank you for the question right I&amp;#39;m not sure um Jamie do we have time for more questions or is it time to move on to the last session of the day I think I think we&amp;#39;re good maybe we&amp;#39;ll take a short break and then wait for the others to join from their breakout session um what time is it now meet back like 4:15 4:20 we&amp;#39;ll probably start 4:15 okay we&amp;#39;re staying on time you heard it from Jen 4:15 we&amp;#39;re starting the last session thanks again to our awesome panelists",

    "transcript": "today for our third video we&amp;#39;re going to be going over different types of karen management options for friedrichs ataxia while there&amp;#39;s currently no cure your doctor may recommend a variety of different referrals to different specialists in order to help with the care of the different symptoms of this disease we&amp;#39;re going to start first with musculoskeletal and neurologic symptoms as there tends to be a fair amount of overlap there for starters we talked last time about how different patients may have issues with the alignment with their spine or with contractures or other issues with their hands or feet that might make it difficult to walk for that your physician might recommend that you see physical and occupational therapy who are experts in exercises exercises to help with that coordination as well as different orthotic devices to help with those contractures or with alignment of the spine as well as possibly different types of walking assist devices such as walkers or wheelchairs for patients who need that next if the issues with the alignment of the spine or with the extremities are significant enough your doctor might recommend that you see an orthopedist who might have a surgical option to help correct that to a certain extent we also talked last time about how in a minority of patients you can have uh issues come up in terms of vision or with hearing for that ophthalmology and audiology are the folks you want to see they can help you with vision correction and also different types of hearing aids to help with those issues uh next on our list we have speech and swallow therapy we talked before about those symptoms called dysarthria and dysphagia which are fancy words for saying difficulty speaking and difficulty swallowing which have to do with the trouble with coordination that can arise with friedrich&amp;#39;s ataxia but your speech and swallow therapists are experts in helping with different exercises and techniques to help with those symptoms last we have different types of sleep specialists uh some patients with um free drinks ataxia have trouble with apnea when they sleep meaning they have times when they briefly stop breathing which can um really help or make more difficult your quality of life when you sleep and sleep specialists can help you there next we&amp;#39;re going to be going on to cardiac issues moving on to karen management of cardiac symptoms we&amp;#39;ll be looking at some of the screening tools your doctor might recommend as well as a brief look at some medications that they may or may not decide are right for you for starters you might see a cardiologist or your neurologist might also recommend that you have an ekg also sometimes known as an ecg which is a non-intrusive test in order to assess the rhythm and the overall electric function of the heart can be done in a couple minutes with just sticking some pads on the chest without any real discomfort they might also suggest an echocardiogram sometimes it&amp;#39;s short called an echo which takes imaging of the heart structure and its function just using an ultrasound probe again completely non-intrusive just requires a little bit of gel this is important because sometimes for patients the heart&amp;#39;s thickness continues to increase over size and we need to be able to look and see whether its function is good enough to continue pumping blood in and out appropriately next you might have some ambulatory monitoring similar to an ekg where it checks the electric signals of the heart but done over the course of days or sometimes even weeks with pads in order to check and see if there&amp;#39;s any abnormal rhythms or other issues with the electric signals of the heart that we might not pick up just from having the ekg done in the doctor&amp;#39;s office some physicians might also recommend that you have an mri which takes very detailed picture of the heart although whether or not that&amp;#39;s right for you might be up to your physician finally when the heart&amp;#39;s function isn&amp;#39;t working as well as we&amp;#39;d like there are different medications that can help reduce the stress on the heart by changing the signaling pathways that the heart uses to regulate itself we&amp;#39;re not going to go into too much depth of these because that&amp;#39;s really up to you and your physician to decide if these medications are right for you but ace inhibitors and beta blockers are two types of medication that are also used for hypertension that can help reduce that stress upon the heart while not all patients with friedreich&amp;#39;s ataxia develop diabetes it&amp;#39;s an important enough issue that we should touch on it at least briefly both primary care physicians and endocrinologists are capable of managing diabetes and you&amp;#39;ll likely have regular checks to see if your blood glucose is at appropriate levels or not blood sugar monitoring can be done in a couple different ways for patients with reduced ataxia it&amp;#39;s generally done with the glucose tolerance testing which involves drinking a substance with a large amount of sugar in it and then checking your blood glucose afterwards some patients also have their test called a hemoglobin a1c which is a test to check what your average blood sugar has been over the last couple of months however it&amp;#39;s usually not as useful in younger patients and it&amp;#39;s used in figuring out the taxi a little bit less often than just checking the glucose next some patients will require insulin in order to make sure that their blood glucose levels are at a decent level although some will be able to manage it simply with a combination of diet or exercise and there are various other types of medications that impact the way your body reacts to the insulin it has remember that in friedrich&amp;#39;s ataxia the issue is that the pancreas often is not able to create enough insulin which is why you might need to be replaced with artificial insulin that you take whereas in other cases the cells are not able to react to the insulin you have effectively enough and don&amp;#39;t bring in that glucose from the blood into the cell itself which of these options is right for you is once again a conversation for you and your physician two more topics that i&amp;#39;d like to briefly discuss are genetic counseling as well as mental health a genetic counselor is an expert in different types of genetic diseases including fragrance for starters they may have different recommendations in terms of testing to confirm the diagnosis remember that in friedreich&amp;#39;s ataxia the fxng which everyone has is unfortunately has an error and that there&amp;#39;s different types of tests in order to see if there&amp;#39;s a problem with that fxn gene likewise you may also have testing done in order to check for the protein for taxin which is normally made as a result of having a correct version of the fxn gene if you have enough normal functioning for taxin then it&amp;#39;s pretty unlikely that you have friedrichs attacks yet they may also discuss with you issues of family planning as well as testing other members of the family as in terms of whether or not they might also have friedrichs ataxia or be a carrier for the disease we&amp;#39;re going to talk a little bit more about the more in-depth issues with the genetics of friedreich&amp;#39;s ataxia in our next video but to suffice it to say that your genetic counselor might be able to go into a little bit more depth in terms of which family members might want to have testing as well as any considerations for starting a family on your own if you or your partner have friedrich&amp;#39;s good news is that patients who have friedreich&amp;#39;s ataxia typically have a fairly uneventful pregnancy compared with the rest of the population and it doesn&amp;#39;t seem to affect pregnancy itself that much mental health is of course an important issue for all patients and especially with those who face a chronic disease like frederick&amp;#39;s ataxia and it&amp;#39;s important that patients have the support that they need especially considering all the stressors that they have dealing with the different types of management that we&amp;#39;ve talked about in the symptoms there are two main broad categories that you might consider for mental health for a specialist you might want to see a psychiatrist is someone who has a medical degree or a do license and is able to prescribe medications whereas a psychologist is someone who specializes in mental health isn&amp;#39;t able to prescribe medications but quite often is able to spend significantly more time with the patient and spend more time with talk therapy",

    "transcript": "hello my name is Ruby Wallace and I&amp;#39;m a senior research officer at taxi UK and today I&amp;#39;ll be giving you a research update on free tracks ataxia firstly I&amp;#39;ll be talking about a taxi UK research activities and the process of research next I&amp;#39;ll be talking about developments and new treatments and finally I&amp;#39;ll be talking about opportunities to take part in research in the UK looking at a taxi UK research activities and the process of research taxi UK funds research projects and these are mostly small grants to get initial results from our 2022 impact report we saw that every one pound that attacks the UK spends on research projects raises almost five pounds of further funding specifically for more Ataxia research we&amp;#39;re also involved in organizing research conferences for example there&amp;#39;s going to be a research conference in November called the international Congress for a taxi research which attacks the UK are organizing alongside the U.S Charities Farah and Naf so to get a drug approved it needs to go through clinical trials and I&amp;#39;ll just take you through the process of these so firstly there&amp;#39;s the pre-clinical stage and this last several years and for this the drug is tested in cells and or animals and this is to look at the dosing and the safety before giving the drug to humans next there&amp;#39;s phase one trials and this lasts several months and this looks at the safety of the drug and how the body processes the drug and its effects on the body and also gives information on appropriate dosing levels a phase two trial will last several months to two years and this looks at the potential risks and benefits of the drug whether the drug works and people who have the condition and also continues to study safety then there&amp;#39;s a phase three trial which is one to four years and this looks at potential risks and benefits compared to no treatment or an existing treatment and typically people are either given the drug or a placebo and this continues to study safety and whether the drug works and more people and just to note the rare diseases such as Ataxia the numbers of people in Trials are usually much smaller and different phases of trial might be combined also in between these phases of trial there&amp;#39;s extra time which is used to develop the trial protocols and then also to analyze the data so what happens next after a successful clinical trial well the treatment needs to get a license from a regulatory agency before being made available so in the UK this is the medicines and Healthcare products regulatory agency the mhra in Europe This is European medicines agency the EMA and in the US this is the Food and Drug Administration the FDA and if the drug agency approves the treatment different bodies decide whether it can be provided by the NHS for example in England this would be nice and in Scotland this would be the Scottish medicines Consortium it&amp;#39;s really important to have a lot of collaboration to advance research and this is something that attacks the UK are very much involved in so a taxi UK links researchers in the Ataxia community so we involved in recruitment to studies and also patient engagement and research and we also work with Pharma and biotech companies to encourage their involvement in a taxi research assist with programs and also collect useful information from the Ataxia community and we&amp;#39;re engaged at all different stages of research from career clinical through to potential treatments being available in the NHS I&amp;#39;m now going to talk about developments and new treatments so in FA there&amp;#39;s a mistake in the for taxing Gene and this leads to a reduction in the amount of the fratoxin protein and this causes a lot of problems and disrupted processes within cells for example oxidative stress an increase in iron in the mitochondria which the energy produces for cells cell damage and disruptive mitochondrial function and decreased energy production and the potential treatments for fa can Target different parts of this process for example genetic approaches to correct or replace it for taxing Gene you can increase the amount of the fratoxin protein or you can Target this disrupted cellular processes so it goes through each one of this in turn and the updates and research in these areas so looking at the different genetic approaches um lectiotherapeutics has been developing a treatment for the cardiomyopathy associated with free drugs and they have a gene therapy called x2006 and that&amp;#39;s designed to transfer the fratoxine gene to Heart cells and they found that in animal models this reverse the cardiac symptoms of free drugs and they in August they started a phase one slash two clinical trial in 10 people with fa in U.S there&amp;#39;s also design Therapeutics which have a treatment called dt216 and this is designed to Target the genetic mutation found in people with free drugs and they&amp;#39;ve got positive results from their cell and animal studies and they&amp;#39;ve started a phase one trial in the US and they&amp;#39;ve dosed their first cohort of patients and they&amp;#39;re expecting the initial trial result by the end of 2022. but indeed there&amp;#39;s a number of different research groups and companies that are developing Gene therapies for food brexitaxia and these are to replace or edit the for taxing Gene for example there&amp;#39;s all these different companies on the right here for example PTC Therapeutics Takeda stripe bio solid biosciences and others I&amp;#39;m now going to talk about um develop some new treatments designed to increase the fratoxin protein so larimar Therapeutics have been working on CTI 1601 and this delivers for tax into the mitochondria which are the energy producers for cells and they&amp;#39;ve done phase one trials in the US and these showed that there was an increase in for taxing however in May 2021 the FDA which is the U.S regulatory agency announced that there was a clinical hold due to the question around safety of a higher dose of this drug in an animal study designed to support a longer term use of the drug but in September this year the full clinical holds now been lifted due to extra information from larimar and a partial hold has been imposed and the phase 2 trial is now expected to start by the end of the year cell Therapeutics have been working on a llama protride which targets the mitochondria and the shown positive effects in cell and animal studies and they&amp;#39;ve been doing a phase two trial in the US to assess the safety visual function and cardiac function there are also drug repurposing approaches so this is when a drug is currently being used for a different condition and we want to test whether it can be used for free drugs for example um calcitriol is being looked at and this is an active form of vitamin D and a taxi UK previously funded a pre-clinical study in Spain and in the animal cell models they found that in cell studies there was improved mitochondrial function improved cell survival and increase the toxin levels in September 2021 they started a trial in Spain for one year and 20 people and this was designed to look at the safety and effect on quality of life and we should be expecting the results of these hopefully soon another drug that&amp;#39;s being looked at is the traveling and this is an antiviral that is used to treat HIV and it&amp;#39;s been found that this increases for taxing in cells derived from patients it&amp;#39;s currently being tested in a phase two clinical trial in Italy to study its safety and efficacy in people with fa and attacks the UK has also funded a project to test drugs that have a similar structure or function to a traveling so looking at developments and new treatments that Target the disruptive processes within cells I&amp;#39;m definitely going to talk about um Riata Pharmaceuticals drug omevaloxone or Omar for short so the rationale behind omav is that in friedrich&amp;#39;s Ataxia there&amp;#39;s a function of the mitochondria and a decrease in energy produced and what omav does is it restores mitochondrial function in um free drugs attacks CSL models by activating a transcription Factor called Nrf2 that is reduced in free drugs so there&amp;#39;s been a multi-center trial where a London Ataxia Center was the UK trial site and this trial had Parts one two and an open label extension in adults over 16. so the details of the trials the part one of the trial included 69 participants and for every three people that took omav one person took a placebo and this was a 12-week study and it was designed to work out the safety and determine the dose of omav to take for part two part two of the study included 103 adults and there was a one-to-one ratio between people who took omav and people who took a placebo and this was to determine the safety and efficacy of the dose that was decided from part one and this was a 48-week study and finally there was the open label extension and everyone who took part in Parts one and two were eligible for this study and all people um were took omav so the results of this um trial been very positive and the results of part one found the best dose of the study um first of the um treatment found that it had a good safety and there was also Improvement in the m5s and this is a free drugs Ataxia rating scale and is used to measure the progression of the disease in free trikes the results of part two um were published and these showed that patients taking omap for 48 weeks had a statistically significant Improvement and their symptoms associated with free drugs than those on the placebo trials and this was again measured by the M5 scale and the results of the extension were announced in May 2021 and these showed further evidence for the positive effect of omab and these results are also going to be shared at the upcoming International Congress for Ataxia Research Conference in November so now it&amp;#39;s at the stage where we are just discussing with the regular Regulators to seek drug approval for Omar and I just want to take you through a timeline of what&amp;#39;s been happening in this process so in November 2020 the FDA which of the U.S Regulators did initial review of the data of part two of the study and part of the extension and they asked for additional analyzes and said that there might need to be a further trial in 2021 um in January um attacks the UK supported the um Farah the U.S um freed rights Charities campaign to ask the FDA and riarter to consider approving the drug just based on the existing data and not doing another trial and then in May 2021 we got the positive results of the extension phase in March 2022 and Riata completed its submission of the new drug application to the FDA so the next step in this process is for the FDA to use this new drug application to decide whether to approve the treatment in May 2022 we found out that the FDA um granted over priority review designation which means that they&amp;#39;ll review the riata&amp;#39;s application in a shorter time period um Riata also announced that they hope to complete um a European regulatory submission at the end of the year and unfortunately this doesn&amp;#39;t include the UK in August 2022 um Riata met with the FDA and they submitted further evidence to support Omar So currently we&amp;#39;re waiting to hear a response regarding the fda&amp;#39;s decision on improving omav from the U.S and we&amp;#39;re hoping to receive this by the 28th of February next year so for omav to be approved in the UK it&amp;#39;s a little bit different so Riata need to submit an application to the UK Regulators which are the mhra and Ataxia UK have been working with a meeting with Riata to encourage and support them in seeking UK regulatory approval and we&amp;#39;ve been adding all omav updates to our website and you can keep updated with omav news and also sign up for the omav specific newsletter at ataxia.org dot UK forward slash omav updates PTC Therapeutics are working on a drug called vatically known and they&amp;#39;ve been doing a trial on on this um this is an antioxidant and is shown positive results in small phase two trials So currently they&amp;#39;re doing a phase three trial and this is all going in the trials called move fa and in this drug people either taking the drug or a placebo and it involves 146 adults and children and it&amp;#39;s an 18-month study and what they&amp;#39;re looking at in this um their primary measure is the mvars which is this measurement of disease progression in free drugs and they started this study in December 2020 and they&amp;#39;re anticipating the results in the second quarter of next year so we are looking forward to those minorics Therapeutics are working on a drug called min-102 and mim-102 is a ppar gamma activator and what PPA are gamma is is a protein found in cells and in FA the PPR gamma can&amp;#39;t function properly and a phase one clinical trial showed that Min one O2 is well tolerated and able to reach the brain so they did a phase two trial in Europe for 39 people and they showed promising results for safety in Upper linger attacks here but the changes in the spinal cord were inconclusive so what they&amp;#39;ve been doing now has been using the status to design a phase 3 trial and this isn&amp;#39;t a discussion with the UK app with the European and the U.S regulators and finally some further trials there&amp;#39;s um ongoing Resveratrol in Australia and what was spiritual is is it&amp;#39;s a naturally occurring compound found in the skin of red grapes and it potentially improves a mitochondrial function there&amp;#39;s also a study looking at an NAD plus precursor by Metro International biotech and this is primarily a safety trial that&amp;#39;s ongoing in the U.S in 10 adults and there&amp;#39;s a study in France of 20 people for a drug called artesanate as well and looking at developments in new treatments there&amp;#39;s also stuff looking at symptomatic relief rather than these underlying processes so it&amp;#39;s been found that applying a low electrical current to the scalp might alleviate some of the symptoms of ataxia so one of these techniques is called cerebellar transitranial direct current stimulation or tdcs for short and attacks the UK previously funded a ttcs trial in Italy and this looked at a range of the taxis including free drugs and last year we found out the results and they showed improvements in two different clinical rating scales one&amp;#39;s called Sarah which is the scale for assessment and rating in the tax year and the other one called icars which is the international Cooperative Ataxia rating scale and they also found improvements in cognition and quality of life scores however results in other studies just looking at Supply no cerebellar ataxias have shown mixed results therefore we wanted to look at a different um technique called transcranial alternating current stimulation of tax and attacks the UK funding a tax trial by the same group in Italy and this could be potentially be more even more effective than the tdcs at a leading symptoms of ataxia and finally I want to move on to um looking at opportunities to take part in research in the UK so there&amp;#39;s the fa Global patient registry so many Charities including the taxi UK have patient Registries and these are used to recruit for clinical trials and research studies but the groups have come together to build an international registry now called the fa Global page and registry and this is a global effort to pull information into one place and make it a more powerful resource for research and helps us understand the condition and patient experiences so if you&amp;#39;re interested in registering for this then you can look at fa patientregistry.org and so far we&amp;#39;ve got over a thousand people with fa who have registered and over 51 countries represented in the patient registry looking at research tools there&amp;#39;s the fa app and this is a really um nice app that&amp;#39;s set up by the charity ndfa and it&amp;#39;s used to help people with sa into facilitate research so their aims are to connect people with fa to researchers running clinical and virtual research trials and it also empowers people with fa with useful tools for managing your life and treatment and it educates people about symptoms diagnosis treatments and it&amp;#39;s also really good for sharing the latest fa news and so to look at this you can go to the fa app.org or you can download it from the Apple store or Google Play there&amp;#39;s a um European fa Consortium study and this is a multi-site European natural history study and what natural history studies do as they look at progression of a um disease over time and there&amp;#39;s a site in London as well as other European sites and they&amp;#39;re still recruiting and the state is being used to design trials that&amp;#39;s really important um so the funding from this comes from the EU patient groups by your attacks in also pharmaceutical partners and the London Ataxia Center is recruiting for this so if you&amp;#39;ve been diagnosed with fa and interested in taking part please contact Professor Paulo Shanti at p d ucl.ac.uk there&amp;#39;s also a speech therapy study ongoing and for people with free drives and what this is looking at is whether intensive practice of articulation exercises improves speech in people with Progressive Ataxia so the study will provide intensive one-to-one input with a speech and language therapies working on articulation in an online format so your involvement in this would last around four months in total including assessments and treatment and four weeks of these were involve therapy input consisting of four one-hour sessions per week and the study is jointly funded by Ataxia UK and lsbt Global and it&amp;#39;s carried out by researchers at strathpide University and if you&amp;#39;re interested in taking part in this and would like more information please email professor Anya lowett at a DOT lower strath.ac.uk and we also have opportunities for healthcare research and you can find these on our website so one of these is the Google&amp;#39;s AI for social good program by project euphonia so this is collecting speech samples from people with speech difficulties in order to improve voice recognition technology so for example this could be used to improve Google Assistant there&amp;#39;s also a survey looking at moving from child to adult health care services and the aim of this particular study is to produce a report for clinicians and other professionals about how to improve the care they deliver and guidance for young people and families and what care you should expect to receive in terms of upcoming trials and opportunities the European and there&amp;#39;s the European fa nicotinamide trial which has unfortunately been delayed but when recruitment starts in London they expect to recruit up to 90 people and the aim for this is to start in 2023 and in order to be kept up to date with all the new research opportunities and we suggest that you join the taxi UK and all of our studies and all this information can also be found on our website at ataxia.org.uk so you can go to the Ataxia research Tab and then under that is taking part in research and then there&amp;#39;s sections that would be relevant including Healthcare research and then there&amp;#39;s a section specifically for people with free drugs ataxia so thank you very much for listening and if you have any questions please contact me at our Wallace ataxia.org.uk or the team at researchataxia.org.uk thank you",

    "transcript": "all right we&amp;#39;re gonna get started here um I think we all know how important travel is not only for us for like Recreation and vacation but also for clinical trials and clinical appointments and just care um especially for people with a disability like fa and so I&amp;#39;ve invited some experts on travel with me who have experience with travel and um and all the issues surrounding it and so uh we want to learn a little bit our goal is to leave about 10 15 minutes at the end of this panel for question answer from the audience so keep that in mind as we go through and address some of the things um I I&amp;#39;m gonna have a disclaimer right now I lost my voice yesterday because everyone came out and we had an incredible day at R taxia so thank you for that right off the bat um but so for our travel panel I&amp;#39;m gonna hand it over we&amp;#39;re gonna go down and do self introductions real quick and then we&amp;#39;re going to jump into some of the issues and stories so Sean would you like to introduce yourself I would love to my name is Sean I have I have patrix a taxia I was diagnosed in 2007 I&amp;#39;m 43 sobr this minute Kyle and I are the exact same age I live in Sacramento California I work full-time for a grocery company and only side I do a lot of side hustles such as podcasting and patient advocacy and whatever I can do to um just Advance life I suppose all right thank you Sean Megan I&amp;#39;m Megan leaper I I was diagnosed in 2017 um seven years ago uh I&amp;#39;m 26 and uh my family and I recently got a wheelchair accessible RV and we&amp;#39;ve been kind of traveling around um to different parts of the US with it and um it&amp;#39;s been really fun uh to go and visit the several parts and places that we&amp;#39;ve been to all right hello I&amp;#39;m T sorry sorry yeah oh can you hear me okay sorry um I&amp;#39;m Terry nearer I&amp;#39;m uh director of client services for Block clinical and we&amp;#39;re a service pro provider for clinical trials and um we work with the participants and the sites for payment as well as logistics for um including hotels Transportation uh ground transfers and flights as well all right Tyler hi I&amp;#39;m Tyler Anderson Leonard I am the manager of our product Innovation group at deltaf flight products where we have been working on developing an entire Suite of accessible products for the aircraft such as the seat that you see back there with our team awesome thank you Tyler and we&amp;#39;re going to jump into a little more of the stories in the panel so thank you for that brief introduction Daniel sure hi everybody I&amp;#39;m Daniel Van Sant I am the director of Disability Policy at the Harkin Institute at Drake University based in De Moine Iowa um we work primarily in the area of disability employment working with companies universities agencies but of course without access to transportation you are not working very many places so we&amp;#39;ve started to work in transportation policy as well um I have a physical disability that I was born with but not fa um I&amp;#39;m also on the disability advisory committee for cruise which is the autonomous vehicle um subsidiary of General Motors so excited to be part of this conversation awesome so first of all I want to start at the end I I know that you know not well not physically at the end like at the end of the concept so so I want to start with Shan and Megan um Sean what what is one of the travel experiences or places you visited that really sticks out to you most recently sure I went to this random Road in India uh and that one sticks out to me be you know it&amp;#39;s a long trip but I also hurt myself so the trip home was even longer U so I think the question was what is the most significant and I would have to put that up up on top of the list yeah what uh what what would you like to tell your one kind of about that experience uh maybe don&amp;#39;t do it you know there&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s nothing I don&amp;#39;t know I think life is worth living at that level of uh risk yeah so I&amp;#39;m I think we&amp;#39;re crazy but I also think that&amp;#39;s the way life is meant to be lived so um you know do your part in planning and and take precautions but maybe don&amp;#39;t let things stop you from at least trying yeah I&amp;#39;ll hear all right and Megan you talked a little bit about this accessible RV what are and you you mentioned a couple of that you&amp;#39;ve been different places what are those places and why are they important to you well uh what of my bucket list items is to go to all the national parks uh and before we acquired the RV uh we went my parents and I went up all the way to the bad lands and is it Nebraska South Dakota okay South Dakota thank you same [Laughter] thing uh we went to the Badlands and it was I wanted to stay there more um it was just really nice and peaceful over there and it wasn&amp;#39;t just a desert there was nice uh L nice uh floor if you want to be scientific over there and some nice animals to look at we saw a lot of animals on that trap that was I don&amp;#39;t know so Megan why is traveling important to you I I&amp;#39;ve always wanted to travel I&amp;#39;ve always like traveling and then uh whenever I was diagnosed I really wanted to still be able to travel and uh there were just a whole lot of barriers that I didn&amp;#39;t realize that there would be uh mainly because I just haven&amp;#39;t thought of it and um so I still want to be able to travel to places and not have to worry about if a hotel is going to be a this B of if they&amp;#39;re going to if this restaurant I can get into the restaurant if I can get into places and enjoy places and entertainment and everything where I go so I I feel that travel is very important in that aspect well I love that you took it into your own hands and your family figured out a way to make it happen even with all the challenges so lovely so I want to jump into travel for clinical care and clinical trials um and Sean I know that you&amp;#39;ve traveled we&amp;#39;ve talked about it on the podcast and you&amp;#39;ve traveled for clinical draws and clinical care um can you give everyone just maybe a an overview of how that works for you and where where you usually go for your care yeah my my clinical site is UCLA Dr season pran that&amp;#39;s typically where most of mine are I&amp;#39;ve done a couple elsewhere but for me that&amp;#39;s an hour and a half flight to maybe a seven hour drive I&amp;#39;m not a fan of driving um you we talk fatigue earlier their car puts me to sleep and I I have a feeling if you&amp;#39;re driving and you fall asleep that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s a bad position to be in um so I fly and generally speaking it it&amp;#39;s fairly smooth but also I realize that I&amp;#39;m a little more ambulatory and have a little more strength than many people do so I know it&amp;#39;s easier for me than it is most um and some of the arrangements that get taken care of just help make that a little bit more manageable awes I already forgot the question that&amp;#39;s okay I think you you answered it really well and Megan we talked about in you know in our preparation that that you guys have figured out clinical sites and doctors to visit within driving distance is that true I am very fortunate that I live about an hour some change from ET Southwest so that&amp;#39;s where I go for all the doctor&amp;#39;s appointments I did have a clinical trial at Long Beach California but that was at the beginning of 20120 and what happened then I don&amp;#39;t what do you mean everyone knows what happened so that was just kind of crazy so I&amp;#39;ve I be I both flew there and drove there and it is it does take longer to get from Dallas to El Paso then El Paso to Los Angeles by the way in case if anybody is wondering if that was true it is true oh okay appreciate that all right thank you so much Megan um Terry we&amp;#39;ve heard a little bit of the experiences and where people go and we know that it can be a challenge travel can be a challenge and so how does block clinical support travel for clinical trials so what we do is um we we work directly with the particip ipants um with their caregivers with their family whoever&amp;#39;s going to be traveling with them to find out what their specific needs are um you know we are actually we&amp;#39;re usually hired by the pharmaceutical company or the cro to be able to support it um and so we have our coordinators work directly with them um talking to the people that are going to be traveling find out what the specific needs are and then um we book that travel for them and prepay for it so for your airline tickets um find out what kind of um needs you you have um what kind of devices you travel with um what kind of you know make sure that we have the appropriate seats if you need aisle chairs um you know with um transfers what&amp;#39;s needed what kind of supports needed with that and make sure we cover all those arrangements and then we find flights for you also how long you want your flights to last you know do you want a direct flight do you want do you need a break every couple of hours you know how long do you need for a layover um all those kinds of details and then we also work with you on your hotel accommodations um specifically what kind of um room you need um what what kind of bathroom you need um you know the the width of the doors the height of the bed those kinds of Arrangements um and you know we we try to get as many things because it&amp;#39;s so it&amp;#39;s not just a one siiz fits-all obviously it&amp;#39;s um everybody&amp;#39;s needs are different and and that is one thing that we&amp;#39;ve really found out about the fa um participants is that it has it&amp;#39;s very personal and and advocating for yourself and letting us know what you need uh then we also do ground transportation as well so these services are all prepaid um and so we find out the right kind of vehicle um how you can transfer what what works best with your if your device that you&amp;#39;re traveling with if it&amp;#39;s a chair um if it folds up you know what what you can ride in what you can&amp;#39;t ride in and then we schedule all those things we also do um site we do uh reimbursements and um the thing that&amp;#39;s a little different about block is that we do it&amp;#39;s a direct deposit um instead of just getting a reloadable debit card we actually put the money back into your account so you can use it as you need to um and we can add as many people like you know like a participant can receive the funds or for reimbursements or the you know one of your other family members could get this typen payments or we can add as many different people need to be paid as poss as you need us to um so and then that&amp;#39;s how we you know support and we also work with the sites uh to coordinate the visits and um and then we try to provide some emotional support too especially for some of the um the longer trips and then just find out what&amp;#39;s available in those areas too for you and I wanted to let everyone know this and I I hope I don&amp;#39;t embarrass you here but um Terry let us know that that she is unwilling to let go of any of her fa accounts she loves working with our community so Terry you you&amp;#39;re our person thank you it&amp;#39;s true so I&amp;#39;m very attached Dan as some of them do know Daniel we we just heard Terry talk about you know all the reimbursement through Clinic called trials and that makes sense cuz there&amp;#39;s a sponsor you know but travel is really expensive and you have to travel for clinical care a lot of times especially in this community when we don&amp;#39;t have very many people we don&amp;#39;t have sites right next door A lot of times um and so what are some of the things that we should think about maybe like with Medicaid or other mechanisms for for paying for travel specifically for clinical visits sure so I think there&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s really a spectrum of options out there I feel like this is kind of one of those if you watch those YouTube videos about how to like maximize your credit card points or sort of like game the system there&amp;#39;s a lot of tools out there that I feel like people don&amp;#39;t know across sort of the economic spectrum so for for anyone who&amp;#39;s on Medicaid for example um Federal Medicaid regulations require that every state medic Medicaid agency have coverage of what they call non-emergency medical transport so this isn&amp;#39;t like you taking an ambulance or something like that but going to a a needed clinical appointment a doctor&amp;#39;s visit something like that so I know we have people from various States if you&amp;#39;re on Medicaid your state has a policy for what is covered under non-emergency medical NT non-emergency medical transport because we love our acronyms and so there could be options in your state to have mileage reimbursed if you drive yourself or have a family member or someone drive you or to pay for part of a hotel stay if you&amp;#39;re required to stay overnight you you&amp;#39;ll want to check whatever the policy is in your state for how far away that needs to be or um how much they&amp;#39;ll pay per mile or per Hotel night but a lot of people don&amp;#39;t even know that that&amp;#39;s a possibility for people who are not on Medicaid um there&amp;#39;s a few other mechanisms that I want to highlight so FSA accounts or flexible spending accounts are something that you can get through your employer for example I have one through our univ University and so that is a pre-tax mechanism where I put a piece of my paycheck into this flexible spending account to use for medical purposes and so for example where I live in Iowa I&amp;#39;m probably 2 and a half hours away from an orthopedist that specializes in what I need them to do and so I can actually take that visit and then when I come back submit a reimbursement to my FSA for mileage and if the appointment was at a certain time of day I&amp;#39;ll stay overnight either on the way there or back um and I get part of the hotel not the whole hotel reimburse so if you have an FSA through your employer that&amp;#39;s also something to check out and that can be typically for you or if you have a dependent um maybe you&amp;#39;re a parent of someone who&amp;#39;s traveling so you can look into that hsas um or health savings accounts like I said this is we have a lot of tips today um hsas are are another acronym here is not employer required so you could open up an HSA yourself as an employed individual and just put money in there similar to an FSA and use that to pay for this type of health health expenditure um and then the last one I want to highlight are able accounts so I don&amp;#39;t know how many people in here have heard of or maybe have able accounts but these are specific saving mechanisms for people with disabilities that importantly do not the first $100,000 in your able account does not count toward your assets for SSI so it&amp;#39;s just a completely set aside saving mechanism but you don&amp;#39;t have to be on medicator receiving benefits to have an able account um a lot of people in this room qualify for able accounts and maybe don&amp;#39;t even know it but able accounts are very very flexible and what you can use them for and so you family members friends whoever can contribute money to your able account and it grows tax free um and you can use it for anything that improves your quality of life as a person with a disability and so that includes not only travel for medical treatment but like that trip to the bad lands could have been paid for out of an able account like your vacations your um fund travel could also come from an able account that is growing tax taxfree so there&amp;#39;s a lot of these mechanisms for different people to explore to help at least cover something right $50 of a hotel room is $50 that you can spend on something else so look into these systems of what you might qualify for and make sure you&amp;#39;re taking advantage of of everything that you can wonderful oh that&amp;#39;s very useful thank you Daniel um so I want to delve in a little bit on specifically on plane travel and Sean first of all I wanted to I wanted to ask you what&amp;#39;s your worst and what your best experience is traveling by plane like do you want Airlines or not necessary no no we don&amp;#39;t want disclose any any names here whatever you want I would the best was um a flying to a fair event I believe energy of all but don&amp;#39;t quote me years ago was it never flew this Airline was in line this before the Walker before the will chair and this Airline you you kind of I think I was late so I was in line to get on the plane and there was a security agent that worked for that airline that saw me in line and thought I was inebriated and this is the best experience um honestly this is a good story so the gentleman came over to me and just quietly PL asked sir can I can I pull you out of line and just speak to you for a minute so I I kind of figured what was coming so I said sure we stepped over a few feet and he was like okay I just you know we get the impression that maybe you&amp;#39;re not so I exactly what it said those were are probably illegal but um he said something expressing concern and I explained I have a condition B BL BL and he was like I understand thanks for sharing that with me S to slow you down let&amp;#39;s get you on the plane and I had I think four flights you know a connection on the way here and connection on the way back and he said I W make sure the flight crew knows and I didn&amp;#39;t think much of it I&amp;#39;m like yeah whatever but he literally made sure the flight crew knew and a note was placed on every flight on that particular trip so that when I checked in on the return there was there was no issue like there was no concern and I just thought that was impressive because it&amp;#39;s not too often the airlines go out of your way or or go out of their way for a passenger unless you&amp;#39;re some Elite Gold Platinum Plus Diamond person which I&amp;#39;m not um so I was just impressed with the way it was handled and the trickle down effect yes the worst was probably a more recent trip um now flying when you&amp;#39;re damaged is just not fun and twofold other countries don&amp;#39;t really have the standards that we have and that could be good or bad um so flying in in another country was rough when I was ringed up but back in the States um I had to use the I Tera I couldn&amp;#39;t walk and I couldn&amp;#39;t really fiture walk and guys would kind of you know push me into a and that was great um because I had I had a flat credit so I used that to upgrade to first class so for a minute I was double platinum diamond whatever U so for one flight anyway the the hoisting I chose a window and it was probably foolish but um you know on first glass you have that big armrest tray thing right between you so they set me in the first seat and then we had to hoist over that armrest into the next seed and it was you know this side that was beat up and they picked me up but didn&amp;#39;t pick me up high enough and swung me right into that hard plastic may as well be metal with spikes um armrest and that the you know it&amp;#39;s one thing to bang your arm or your head for a minute but that pain linger the most of the fight like it was just hard to get comfortable again and probably also because at that point I didn&amp;#39;t really have a lot of good pain meds all right that&amp;#39;s some yeah well thank you Sean um for reliving that for a moment um I think I know a lot of people here can probably relate maybe not to that extreme but you know I think there&amp;#39;s probably a lot of experience I&amp;#39;ll add I think the overall point of the story was having the the bad experiences usually involve people that really aren&amp;#39;t trained well or don&amp;#39;t really know how to handle you or your device right thank you for that so Daniel considering some of these experiences um you know we talked about the ad a a little bit and some of the different protections that it provides um and can you tell us a little bit about that considering plane travel and what we should think about with some of the Productions provided by the Ada and and others sure so closer my microphone um yeah I I think one important thing that I would want to emphasize is just how complicated the legal system around air traffic is because we really struggle to make laws that are simple and straightforward in our country um and so the Americans with Disabilities Act Right covers for all forms of public life so your employment your sort of public accommodations like your public spaces um and so in regards to air travel specifically the Ada if you think of the Ada&amp;#39;s sort of jurisdiction it&amp;#39;s like everything involved with air tra until you get to the airplane or the airplane services so the Ada covers hotels public transportation um like your ride shares your taxis sidewalks it covers the airport and the terminal but a different legal framework covers the airplane and the um airline companies so your your ticket sales all of that are the air carrier access act so I think one it&amp;#39;s just important to know that those are two different laws with their own sets of regulations because right if you&amp;#39;re not informed about these things it&amp;#39;s a little bit harder to protect your rights or or argue for your rights so know that those are different um the accessibility regs are often a little bit similar the Air carry access act will sometimes pull from the Ada but now we&amp;#39;re getting a little bit deep into the weeds here so just know that the same accessibility standards that you&amp;#39;re maybe used to with hotels restaurants Parks other public spaces are not the same for the airline itself which is why right a lot of air airport or um sorry airplane bathrooms right are not like the big accessible bathrooms because those are two different regulatory um guidelines and I know Tyler can certainly talk more to that piece there so just know that those are two separate pieces is I want to jump to Tyler but I wanted to you know a lot of us know a thing or two about the Ada I didn&amp;#39;t I didn&amp;#39;t know anything about the air carrier access act so what&amp;#39;s one thing you can tell us that&amp;#39;s important about the air carrier access act that we should know or or that&amp;#39;s interesting whatever you want yeah um well I mean hopefully it&amp;#39;s interesting that it exists if that&amp;#39;s new information you now have one more thing to be empowered with um something that I think is is good for people to know is that if you are traveling with a medical device maybe you have a CPAP or a um dialysis machine with you or your cane your folding wheelchair if you&amp;#39;re traveling with medical equipment or device that does not count toward your baggage limitations so so let&amp;#39;s say you can check a bag right and then on the carryon you can typically have a personal item and a carryon piece of luggage so you can still have that carry-on suitcase your personal item and your CPAP in a bag and that CPAP does not put you over your baggage allotment so just know that that&amp;#39;s an option now that medical baggage does have to be medical equipment you can&amp;#39;t just put like an inhaler in a duffel bag and say uh this is this is my access like you can&amp;#39;t quite gain the system but you don&amp;#39;t have to take up space in your on bag with a CPAP or other medical device you can carry it on separately um and it doesn&amp;#39;t count toward your your baggage limitation great thank you Tyler we have this awesome Booth back here and um demonstrating an incredible thing that we we&amp;#39;re going to be able to get on the plane and and be a little more accessible can you talk about the different products that that you guys are developing at Delta fly product certainly um so the the wheelchair accessible seat is um the example of the very first real accessibility product that we took on in our group we&amp;#39;ve we&amp;#39;ve kept the entire accessible product Suite within the Innovation group because it really Fosters a lot of new invention and a lot of creativity that you typically don&amp;#39;t get with a regular design process um so we started out with the seat it was a con conep that was designed by a Consortium out of the UK one of which is the founder of flying disabled who you may be well aware of Chris Woods um who has two adult children who have loved to travel their entire lives and so he&amp;#39;s always faced those challenges and the Consortium came to us at deltaf flight products and said okay we have an idea but how do we Design This and get it on an aircraft and and so we&amp;#39;ve become uh part of that partnership in order to develop the seat um we started out with a business class version of the seat because the um lack of Isle width on the aircraft requires us to have that in a front row position uh in order to be accessible by a wheelchair um however what we have done with both the business class version and now this the economy version is really worked a lot with all of those guidances that Daniel was mentioning if you can imagine where he talks about ADA and ACA and we have not only them but we have FAA and the FAA reauthorization act and we have all of the different safety critical things that we have to be able to comply with to put any product on an aircraft but when working with accessible product especially so so um we&amp;#39;ve gotten a long way with it we&amp;#39;ve really partnered with the FAA and the Department of Transportation early on in the process for the seat um and right now we have submitted two uh cases that are called tsos with the FAA for both the economy and the business version of the seats and we&amp;#39;re going into testing for it so that we can prove that it&amp;#39;s safety and it meets all of the requirements and we can start working towards installing it on an aircraft so more to come and soon to come um but then using the Innovation processes what that also did for us was started showing us where the constraints and the gaps were so um ran s who&amp;#39;s back there demoing the seat for you came up with the concept for a cargo tray that is more protective of wheelchairs so that if in the event you do have to have a wheelchair placed into the cargo hold number one it increases the number of aircraft that the wheelchairs will fit in but number two utilizing some really standard um practices in shipping and freight industry has um basically three pockets of air that envelop the wheelchair to prevent it not only from environmental damage but most importantly from mechanical damage so it can be inflated around the wheelchair in order to keep it uh customized to the shape the size and such of of that particular chair um that makes it safe for it to be um upright or put on its side and it also secures it to the floor of the cargo so that it isn&amp;#39;t being moved around or sliding around during transport um but then we started thinking about the issues that we have with the onboard wheelchair so onboard wheelchair or aisle chair that you&amp;#39;re familiar with we have heard the problems that are associated with using that and so we&amp;#39;ve moved on now to looking at a better design for an onboard wheelchair that will prevent it from um banging into seats that will make it much more more um make it much easier to be able to guide it through the isleway uh make it much more padded um so the the FAA reauthorization act came out and required changes to the onboard wheelchair um we&amp;#39;ve also been told by Department of Transportation that our wheelchair accessible seat is something that&amp;#39;s going to be looked at in the near future and um there was also reauthorization act for on board lavatories and accessibility I want to stake our claim right now that every single one of these was passed long after we began designing what we&amp;#39;re designing today so we&amp;#39;re not being made to do so Tyler I&amp;#39;m gonna press you a little bit here you you use the word soon and um and there was one other anyway uh what what do soon mean so I am not at Liberty to share any dates but what I can tell you is that we&amp;#39;ve heard people within the industry talk about oh that&amp;#39;s going to take 10 years it&amp;#39;s G to take five years it&amp;#39;s going to take three years I&amp;#39;m telling you it&amp;#39;s not going to take that long awesome thank you um so one last question you know there&amp;#39;s been a lot of advocacy in the past few years for for plane travel specifically and um you know seeing that be effective from your SP standpoint what&amp;#39;s the message that you want to give to this room what can we do to support that effort and maybe to support you as well as you guys develop these things I um I love that question thank you uh we have at Delta Airlines they have an advisory Council that&amp;#39;s been in existence for 15 years it&amp;#39;s the longest standing Airline advisory Council covers a wide array of um disabilities um however I also mentioned to you Chris woods with flying disabled we um partner with many different groups and associations of course our partnership with Biogen um and what that has allowed us to do is have access to the user Community um in aviation engineering groups know how to design develop qualify certify install products on aircraft and the airlines are really really good at being able to operationalize them and sustain them what we don&amp;#39;t know is how that product is going to serve you so we really try very hard to make it a part of not only our formal process but just by Presence at events such as this to continually reach out and ask people what do you need what are your experiences we we show the product that we have today and we say please come try it out use it see what you think of it and give us feedback because we iterate the design based on that feedback to make sure that when the product is installed and ready to be used it&amp;#39;s going to meet your expectations beautiful thank you Tyler I want to move on to uh something that we&amp;#39;re all familiar with ground travel and hotel um we&amp;#39;ve all had experiences and Megan in a previous conversation and a little bit here today you mentioned issues with booking hotels um can you tell us a little about that uh my dad he would spend hours just scrolling through uh hotel websites to see if it was accessible or not and whenever he would say that there was a rolling shower he would lean more towards having that and getting that hotel room reservation um but I was talking to my parents last night about this and I was reminded uh one time I think we it was when we flew to the clinical trial uh we reserved uh room for that was accessible and when we got there the hotel staff was like oh that room is not available so there were words uttered and um we quickly went to the hotel cross the street and they had an accessible room thankfully and I was reminded of that last night and um I know of another experience I thought it was at Yellowstone but I was just taken I forgot where um the only thing that the hotel had to make it like an accessible room it was just a single grab bar in the bathroom and that was it and we were like that doesn&amp;#39;t work and we always um triy to tell the staff like this room is not accessible so um with the RV it takes a lot of strats off because we know exactly where we&amp;#39;re going to sleep if we know it&amp;#39;s aisal and we know uh the bathroom situation and it&amp;#39;s all accessible and everything it just takes a lot of stress off for all of us that we&amp;#39;re able to travel around more with the wonderful thank you um so Megan these are common experiences I think we&amp;#39;ve probably anyone who&amp;#39;s booked a hotel that needs a rolling shower it&amp;#39;s probably um experienced some time when when the when it&amp;#39;s not ready um or or it&amp;#39;s not available once you get there and how infuriating is that right and so Sean I wanted to ask you what do you do when you get there and it&amp;#39;s not what you expected or what you need I utter probably the same words um you know you you&amp;#39;ve got to advocate for yourself you know it&amp;#39;s not easy to just make another room work you know it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s one thing to go from a really nice Suite to a standard room okay make it work but when it&amp;#39;s accessibility you need those grab bars you need a little bit of a wider door if you can&amp;#39;t get on the bed or off the bed in the morning like it interrupts everything you&amp;#39;re traveling for like the whole the whole thing so um I&amp;#39;ve thankfully I&amp;#39;ve only had a few of those instances um the most bading was the front desk you know agent got a manager cuz it was a huge Hotel a huge bigest like they&amp;#39;re all big and there wasn&amp;#39;t one accessible room I just I didn&amp;#39;t believe it um and the guy said well you know I had said you know I made the reservation I called I feel like I did my part to make sure the room was going to work for me and he said well we&amp;#39;re we&amp;#39;re not required to guarantee the room and I just thought to myself that&amp;#39;s the dumbest response you could give a person in my situation right now which we should have some regulations for that can you can you help that no it&amp;#39;s the the biggest thing is advocating and and pressing for what you need and ultimately if they&amp;#39;re unwilling to find a way to make it work take a business elsewhere which isn&amp;#39;t always easy you know get into it especially if you&amp;#39;re ubering you&amp;#39;ve gotten dropped off all your luggage your chair everything just find out you can&amp;#39;t stay there now you&amp;#39;ve gotta call another Uber you&amp;#39;ve got to re it&amp;#39;s just yeah we all know yeah all right so not not a simple answer but really I mean it it does help to talk about it and realize that everyone has those experiences like you&amp;#39;re not alone when you do that and sometimes times it&amp;#39;s like just making it happen in the moment and like you said advocating for yourself so yep thank you for that um Daniel I do want to go to you partly because Sean looked down and and um what are the protections that are in place for ground transportation and specifically for hotels sure so excuse me yeah I would say that the Americans Disabilities Act does cover any public spaces so if there&amp;#39;s something like your public transportation that&amp;#39;s run by the city or state or national government but also private entities that provide services to the public so hotel chains ride shares private taxi companies all of these things are covered by the Ada um and required to have accessible accessible rooms accessible features accessible you know websites what have you um I think part of what sea is maybe talking about is there&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s a certain number of accessible rooms in a hotel and if they get booked up you just kind of get this well we&amp;#39;re sorry we&amp;#39;re out of these rooms or we&amp;#39;ve given it to somebody else um right a big conference is in town and booked up all the rooms right I&amp;#39;m going to guess there&amp;#39;s probably not a lot of accessible rooms left in this vicinity because of all of us today which is great but also if you&amp;#39;re not part of this confence confence and you need that room you&amp;#39;re going to get that sort of sorry our rooms are are booked up um that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s often a tangent here but um I I think my sort of tip or piece of advice is I think unfortunately right now spontaneous travel is difficult for the disability Community um right we all know that just because these laws and regulations are in place doesn&amp;#39;t mean that they&amp;#39;re always being followed or that every place you go is following them the same way I I think of um I was in a very small town in rural Iowa and a new hotel had just been built I was going to stay there um I don&amp;#39;t always need an accessible room so I try not to take it if if I don&amp;#39;t feel like I need one um but they put me on the second floor and I had all this luggage and there was no elevator and so I like I can get up a certain number of stairs typically but if I&amp;#39;m carrying my luggage no and so then I was in that moment of like how could you like this was just built within the last 5 years and you have multiple oh well our accessible rooms are on the first floor okay fine but like there&amp;#39;s also that third space of I don&amp;#39;t want to take your accessible room but I also need to be able to get to the others um and again you&amp;#39;re the next closest hotel might be 30 40 minutes away and it&amp;#39;s not like you can hop on so I think the the the sort of pro tip is I I think unfortunately we do really have to try to plan ahead and I would Advocate trying to do as much of this booking in writing as possible because it&amp;#39;s a lot easier to take a screenshot of your emails back and forth with a hotel or ride share company or what have you where they&amp;#39;re saying we don&amp;#39;t have this type of rumor we don&amp;#39;t offer that and that doesn&amp;#39;t solve your problem in that moment but then you can take those sort of things and file complaints go to the Civil Rights Commission in your state go to the Department of Justice and show here&amp;#39;s a hotel that was just built that is telling me they don&amp;#39;t have accessible rooms or here is me trying to book an accessible ride share and being told we don&amp;#39;t take service animals or wheelchairs again I know that&amp;#39;s not helpful in the moment when you&amp;#39;re turned away but trying to book Things ahead of time saving those those chats and things when things go poorly at least gives you mechanism for us to kind of move this forward I think we do a lot of Consulting for for businesses at the Harkin Institute and sometimes you get those businesses that say well we just don&amp;#39;t have any disabled people coming here so why would I need more rooms that are accessible because we don&amp;#39;t get that many disabled clients at our hotel and I have to kind of really lay it out and say do you think maybe you&amp;#39;re not getting disabled customers because you don&amp;#39;t have rooms that we can stay in and it&amp;#39;s just like you see the little dim light bulb go on of like oh we don&amp;#39;t have to put a ramp in front of our sub our uh sandwich shop because we don&amp;#39;t have any customers in wheelchairs and it&amp;#39;s like you&amp;#39;re so close you you&amp;#39;re you&amp;#39;re so close um but so I think having this record of like I hate to tell disabled people that we have to be the squeaky Wheels trying to be greased but if if companies are getting inundated with constant emails and calls and things about accessible rooms accessible taxis accessible seats on Amtrak or on a flight it shows that we are a customer base that would would be contributing to you financially if you allowed us the opportunity which just kind of helps move us all forward so it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s I don&amp;#39;t know that that&amp;#39;s a direct answer but right we have these things in place it&amp;#39;s about enforcing them and showing that we are here we do want to travel we want to be places and the company that puts an inaccessible seat on their airplane is going to get our business yep so show that our business is valuable no it&amp;#39;s a it&amp;#39;s a great response for uh uh thing there is no direct answer right it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s all of us putting our effort forward so thank you for that all right so we&amp;#39;re we&amp;#39;re coming towards the end of our time I did not prepare this panel for this question but think about I&amp;#39;m gonna go to Terry for a second and but before I do that I want you to think about what&amp;#39;s in one or two sentences what&amp;#39;s your number one piece of advice for this room for accessible travel or or booking or so think about that but Terry I wanted to I have a question here for you um what what are your best practices specifically for booking ground transportation and hotel yeah so um when you were talking about hotel just to add on to that I don&amp;#39;t want to take too much time from it but um you know a lot of times with hotels it depends on what year it was built um because there are um certain regulations that if it was built before like uh 2012 um or 2018 there are some different laws that apply to those those specific properties so um what I have found with booking hotels is that certain some of the larger chains do have um better regulations and they do they don&amp;#39;t necessarily follow um like the law requires one of 75 rooms to be accessible um so that that gets really I mean but there are a lot of hotel chains like um like Marriott and Hilton um they they do have more rooms available I think one of the thing that&amp;#39;s really difficult is to not necessarily use the some of the third-party booking agents um which sometimes you can be guaranteed a room because of that but also it&amp;#39;s as accessible if you don&amp;#39;t look carefully it&amp;#39;s it could be hearing accessible um because you&amp;#39;ll find there are a lot of hearing accessible rooms um where and then you&amp;#39;ll maybe see a picture and there&amp;#39;s a grab bar and you know that&amp;#39;s the one grab bar that they have or they&amp;#39;re showing a shower that maybe has a grab bar or a vertical grab bar and a horizontal grab bar and that&amp;#39;s it but it&amp;#39;s saying it&amp;#39;s an accessible room and it&amp;#39;s really not so you really have to you know I find it&amp;#39;s better to go to the website um of the hotel like you might still go back and book it there on you know because you&amp;#39;ll get a better deal or you get points or whatever um but to go look at the hotel and see what&amp;#39;s really available I do think that&amp;#39;s really important um also you know and I have worked for a Hilton before and I&amp;#39;m not pushing them because sometimes I need I think they need to renovate a little sooner but um one of the things about Hilton is that when you do go on one of their websites they do pop a message will pop up if you&amp;#39;re trying to book an accessible room it will ask you is do you really need this accessible room because they reserve it for people that with disabilities that need this room um so I think that&amp;#39;s a really nice piece of it um with Marriott if you&amp;#39;re booking on their website one of the things is you can&amp;#39;t select the the room yet um or you know the accessibility for that room you pick your room type first and then it&amp;#39;ll show you um like what you know then you can drop down after you pick your room type say you want a two queen bedroom it&amp;#39;ll show you um what is available to you for accessibility and then it&amp;#39;ll tell you if it&amp;#39;s guaranteed or if it&amp;#39;s not guaranteed and that is something I found with Mar marot&amp;#39;s really consistent about making sure that you get that room type um and I do a lot of calls to the hotel um and um especially if it&amp;#39;s hotels that we use a lot um just to you know I&amp;#39;ve had them go and measure doorways um you know we&amp;#39;ve had some really great experiences with hotels and we&amp;#39;ve had some really nightmare ones um where you know you just can&amp;#39;t even believe that well you probably can but it it&amp;#39;s insane what happens and and what the an and what the responses are yeah um for um for ground transportation um we do work with um with a national company and um and they you know we can do all types of vehicles um one of the things that we had talked about the other day was um even just like um like if you have a if you can transfer you know that&amp;#39;s important to know what you can transfer into um because a lot of times you may order an SUV because you have a a bigger wheelchair but you&amp;#39;re like uh you know I don&amp;#39;t need a a wave I can use a um an SUV but one of the things a lot of times is they&amp;#39;re the really high ones um you know they&amp;#39;re the big luxury kind and and there you have to take or need to step on a stool to get into it and that&amp;#39;s not an option or may not be an option so it&amp;#39;s something that you need a lower one like a minivan or something along those lines and I think that&amp;#39;s really important to know and to be aware of what you know that that there are all types of things that are offered but but to just be cautious of that um with the bride shares they&amp;#39;ve gone a long way and in Ming what&amp;#39;s available and um like uber has um um it&amp;#39;s Uber wave um and that&amp;#39;s you know it&amp;#39;s not available in every city um but there are a lot of cities that it is available and it&amp;#39;s it is a growing Market um and everybody has to be certified and train same thing with lft um it was lift access and now it&amp;#39;s lift wheelchair um they recently changed their name so that is more available one thing to keep in mind with all of these services and these ride shares is they have limited hours um so it may be 8:00 a.m. to midnight so if you&amp;#39;re going out late night you might want to make sure that it&amp;#39;s available at the time that you need to be picked up because you can run into a situation with it um so it&amp;#39;s just kind of making yourself aware of that and then also just making sure that um you know like advocating for yourself and making it really clear about what you need um there are a lot of taxi companies the one thing I do like about taxi companies compared to some of the ride shares is you you can actually make a reservation ahead of time so um you can order a wheelchair accessible vehicle and it will be there at that time and that&amp;#39;s what I found better about cab services and also when you&amp;#39;re traveling for some of these different sites or locations um you can Google what&amp;#39;s available in the market and you can rent accessible Vehicles you can rent a wave um and also there are other companies that are nonemergency medical where you if you needed a wave they they have them available that you can reserve them to so beautiful sorry I didn&amp;#39;t mean to thank you no no that was wonderful all right before we do our lightning round where everyone&amp;#39;s going to give us their number one tip I want to recognize Kellen she helped get all of this together and put us together and and helped with formuling the question and stuff so thank you K all right I&amp;#39;m G to start the end Daniel what&amp;#39;s your number one advice to everybody sure I think I already gave a lot of tips and tricks so hopefully you took those notes down um I would say my advice is I think a lot of times we as disabled people are told that we need to be grateful and thankful for like the charity that people are giving to us um but these things are required in the law and disabled people in our country and around the world fought and occupied spaces and put their lives on the line to give us these rights um and so I think that helps shift the mindset like existing in public while being disabled is a form of advocacy and so don&amp;#39;t ever feel like you are an annoyance because you need this type of seat or this type of room like you have the right to be at a national park or in a hotel or wherever you want to be whether that&amp;#39;s for medical travel or just tourism so I think take that that you have these rights there&amp;#39;s something really prideful about having a disability and still having access to these spaces so don&amp;#39;t don&amp;#39;t feel like you&amp;#39;re a bother or an annoyance these are rights that people fought to to make sure that we all have and thank you Daniel all right Tyler so I would say number one is make sure that you continue to put your thoughts and your experiences out there understanding that there are design firms and there are Airlines and other people within the entire travel Journey who would be willing to provide something if they were aware that it was something they needed to provide not saying that&amp;#39;s not always the case I mean sometimes you don&amp;#39;t have what you need but the longer you say so the more you put your thoughts out to um the industries the more people will respond to that and make your overall Journey as good as it can be wonderful thank you Terry well I think um it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s being really clear about what your needs are and you know it&amp;#39;s like with planning trips you know you put a lot of thought into where you want to go and what you want and then it&amp;#39;s also putting into thought about what as or as much planning as you can into what your needs are and make and seeing if that&amp;#39;s you know what&amp;#39;s available in that area and and what&amp;#39;s available to you and make sure that you can get it reserved as early as possible and and never be afraid to ask for something that you may or may not think you know would be accessible just I mean sorry but like a Hoyer lift um you know you can rent those and have them delivered to your hotel room and um and that&amp;#39;s one of the things that you know if you if somebody hadn&amp;#39;t asked for it we we wouldn&amp;#39;t have thought to do it so always always ask for what you need it you may get a a no or it&amp;#39;s not available or you might get a let me look into it and and be surprised by what comes out out of it so always ask for what you need thank you Terry Megan I would um say be creative like I have a I found a whole lot of products for uh for the bathroom on Amazon uh there&amp;#39;s like waterless shampoo dry shampoo uh Bath Wipes all that stuff like that&amp;#39;s just for the bathroom and um like you can grab a Piner if you need something that far away You&amp;#39;re a High um maybe just like you have to show other people how difficult it is like you know that&amp;#39;s really not accessible and they&amp;#39;re like I think it is and you&amp;#39;re like okay and then maybe eat yourself onto a bed I don&amp;#39;t know you might have to do that might get the message across hopefully well hopefully you don&amp;#39;t get hurt yeah all right be creative thank you Megan and Sean last word here I love that Daniel said you know in the moment it may not feel good to get a response of XY or Z but having those encounters and talking about them and putting them out there is what helps make new processes and regulations a thing so my final step is don&amp;#39;t be afraid to travel get creative think about it you know plan ahead if you have to but don&amp;#39;t let the challenges you&amp;#39;re up against keep you from enjoying life and enjoying the rights that we we have access to so get whatever that is whether it&amp;#39;s RV Uber on your trike playe live your life I I can beautiful thank you all right um we want to get everyone to lunch I don&amp;#39;t know if we have time for any questions um I think we might move on but before we go to lunch um I&amp;#39;d like to invite Jen up we have a couple of things to say real quick oh a mic you can have mine all right so um thank you all so much for a great panel discussion um just a quick story um my first time meeting Terry was a few years ago on the phone there was a clinical trial ongoing it was happening over the Thanksgiving holiday and I contacted the study sponsor and said you know we&amp;#39;d love phah would love to do something for the folks who are going to be away from home for Thanksgiving what could we possibly do could we host a lunch or a dinner or anything like what could we do and they were like yeah sure I said well how are we going to arrange for transportation on Thanksgiving and Terry totally figured it out they put me in contact with Terry she said what do you want to do I said ideally I&amp;#39;d love to have all these folks come to the fair office on Thanksgiving Day and host a Thanksgiving lunch with them and she found all the drivers all the accessible Vehicles who are willing to give up their time on their holiday to do this for us and she was happy to do it and excited about it and we were back and forth all day like did everybody get there is everything okay um and just Terry thank you because I know you put in countless hours to make those things happen and you made it easy for us and it was you know she said what do you need what do you want and she made it happen so amazing so we just want to take a few minutes before you go to lunch to acknowledge members of our community that had given significant time and expertise in service to the fa community in the fa Mission and our first recognition award is the Ron BK acting together award this is presented to someone who exemplifies the spirit of service and collaboration many of you know Marilyn Downey but for those of you who don&amp;#39;t I&amp;#39;d like to take a minute to introduce you to her Marilyn was the founding Secretary of the far board of directors back in 1998 and served for an incredible 25 years before stepping down this past year in the years when pharah was all volunteer Marilyn was a onew woman show acknowledging all the gifts and running a fundraising Department out of her kitchen she deposited all the checks she handw wrote all the thank you notes and she collaborated with every family doing Grassroots fundraising to help support them in making their events successful my earliest memory was in Marilyn&amp;#39;s kitchen and she and her husband Terry who is Farah&amp;#39;s founding Treasurer were transferring all the records and the books over to Felicia and I and it was one of those moments where you could tell they were like oh thank goodness there&amp;#39;s help but should we really trust you because this is really important and you can&amp;#39;t screw this up Marilyn served on behalf of her daughter Bridget but really she got to know many of you and she served the whole fa Community we don&amp;#39;t give enough time we don&amp;#39;t have enough time for me to share all the ways Marilyn has advanced Farah&amp;#39;s mission to treat and cure fa she has been at all of our scientific conferences she has taken minutes for countless EX executive and board meetings she has volunteered at many events hosted her own events and those are just a few of the many contributions she and her family have made the most remarkable thing about Marilyn and the founding Board of Farah was the courage to set a path where none existed and our journey is so much better because of it and this Year&amp;#39;s acting together award is presented to Marilyn Downing Marilyn couldn&amp;#39;t be here unfortunately but she was hopefully listening um and got to hear all of that um and I&amp;#39;m looking forward to delivering that award to her in person and one last note on Marilyn if you&amp;#39;re ever in need of someone to host an impromptu Hotel dance party she&amp;#39;s your gal don&amp;#39;t ask me why I know Kyle I I I got a mic here and um that that uh presentation comes with a few tears of appreciation um I I was crying those tears partly for Ron because he wasn&amp;#39;t up here in front um thank you marn so our next next award is the community impact award which is given to a group who has made a significant impact on the strength of the community and faroh&amp;#39;s Mission you you may remember a few years ago we recognized founding members of the Ambassador leadership team as those founding members stepped out of their leadership roles there was a need to fill those roles with new people to take on this important work and these emerging leaders were up for the challenge we&amp;#39;d like to acknowledge meline meline Frederick reinford Andrea Kei Matthew lefur Britney Summerfield and Shandra Trantham with this Community impact Awards all have contributed by investing time and leadership in the ambassador program which now has over 80 team members they&amp;#39;ve also yeah they&amp;#39;ve also LED specific project teams for example meline has helped lead teen hangout sessions Andrea and Britney coolled weekly meet the community interviews and blog posts Matt leads the speaking team and Shandra has led the social media team and invested countless hours on fairis Communications team they strengthen the community than this is ridiculous but I love these folks um they strengthen the community Through storytelling both by sharing their own voice and Shining a light on their peers they also stay educated on research and other Fair activities so as to be a resource for others in the community we&amp;#39;re grateful for their leadership and service we invite Britney Matt and Shandra to come forward to receive their Awards and be recognized and we&amp;#39;ll present Andrea and meline with their Awards next month at r at taxi Dallas so come on out you guys thank you",

    "transcript": "welcome everybody um uh we&amp;#39;re going to talk a little bit about uh in the next 10 minutes or so about how Farah funds research and uh um just to let you know that I&amp;#39;m just the warm-up act because after me you&amp;#39;ll hear from three of the real show of this three investigator there were supposed to be four but unfortunately one of them is not feeling that well so but um I&amp;#39;ve heard darl talk earlier in the previous breakout session and it&amp;#39;s really good so stick around to to uh to listen to them and um so I&amp;#39;m I&amp;#39;m lisar I&amp;#39;m the director of research at fair and as Kyle um pointed out yesterday I&amp;#39;m the one who spends the money that he raises uh that&amp;#39;s exactly how you introduced me yesterday um so um so how you know what what do we use that money that you guys all raised for uh we think that the most um impactful strategy to uh fund research is using different mechanisms and one of these mechanism is the fagr program which is a way where uh investigators who have who research fa have ideas proposed to us these ideas and um we found the ones that we think uh are getting us closer to Farah&amp;#39;s goal and Mission who that is to find treatments for fa uh the other um program um is in institutional programs like at the central of excellence in Philadelphia or the fa accelerator at abroad the fa Alliance at Oxford uh where we fund group of investigators in specific institutions these are longer term investments because we want to create this group of multidisciplinary expert er um increase the number of investigators that uh you know are interested in FA and research fa um and also we are trying to leverage some of the resources that these investigations already have and the third third way that we uh fund research is through director project we call them far director project where Farah staff identifies some of the biggest challenges biggest gaps in knowledge uh of the disease mechanism and and we go after investigators and try to get them to answer these questions and you know Pro research certain questions that are very important to us it represents the biggest gaps that we have um what I&amp;#39;m going to talk to you about today is mostly uh about how the grant program works but generally it also applies to the other U mechanism that we um apply so the gr program can be represent Ed as a cycle that starts at end with the knowledge that we have about the disease and this is important because of course uh that informs on the therapeutic development of the disease but also it tells us uh once we know exactly what we know what else do we need to know so we it exposes uh the gaps in knowledge that we have all those questions that we still have to caner and these represent our research priorities that we uh apply uh when investigators come to us with their ideas so we use these research priorities that we develop together with our expert in the field our scientific Advisory Board um and investigators we solicit application from investigators uh so that these research priority can be addressed uh these um investigators come to us with propos proposals we review the proposals um using experts in the field and then we fund the ones that we think are able to address better these priorities answer better these questions um throughout the the uh cycle of the grant we engage with investigators we keep in contact with them review the progress and then hopefully by the end of the project we will learn a little bit more about the disease and we use this knowledge to revise the priorities the research priority for the following year so that for the following cycle uh so that you know at each Cycles we learn a little bit more and we revise um what the big questions that we need to address are what the the the questions that we want to um address uh in FA these are uh are Grand types and as you can see here we have different uh few Cycles over the years and we have different um Grand types some that are aimed at um funding established investigators some that are aimed at funding young investigators in in the early stages of their career like the ones that you see sitting here next to me um other Grand types are General they you know the you can propose to us uh uh research topics that are very general um and others are more specific for example we have a grant to study specifically the heart disease in FA or a grant that uh in which we fund proposals that are more related to therapeutic development we also have grants to that encourage new investigators who have never worked in FA to come to the fa field and study fa okay so now a little bit more detail of what we fund and why we fund it we what kind of research we found and why we fund it and I wanted to start here because this um image shows the drug development process and because obviously ultimately uh is this a pointer sort because this is our goal right to get to an effective treatment in FA we have an first approved drug but this is not the end of the road um fa is a very complex disease you heard it earlier uh today we need need a cocktail to address all the different components of fa and you know this is how a drug is developed the first stage here is a lot of basic research where you try to understand the disease as much as possible um you try to understand all the molecular processes that are involved in the um the manifestation of the disease and all these molecular processes represent present um therapeutic targets things that we can Target with a drug then we have the next phase is the preclinical development where all these potential drugs are tested for example in cell models animal models to determine whether these drugs are indeed efficacious in these models and also to test to study a little bit more the property of these potential drugs like the pharmacolog iCal properties whether they&amp;#39;re toxic or not and then you have clinical trials where these molecules are tested in people um and so you know one thing that I wanted to point out to you is that how this this um uh representation of the drug development process it&amp;#39;s kind of a funnel right so you see a lot of stuff here a lot of drugs a lot of different targets and then you know the number of the drugs become less and less until you get to your your effective treatment and this is a very very typical it&amp;#39;s not just fa along the way there&amp;#39;s going to be some failures they are going to be a lot of attrition and this is expected uh but the important thing that I want to point out to you is that at each stage all this different activities in each stage are or they all learning opportunity for opportunities for us so what&amp;#39;s important to point out is that all these different moments where you you seem to have a little step back these are learning opportunity we&amp;#39;ll always learn from these setbacks and you know at every stage of this development um it seems like you we&amp;#39;re making very small progress this very incremental um progress but but if you take it all together this is a very important all all this incremental um learning is very important to get to us to the finish line which is a treatment for fa so what can we do to uh try to help this this process the the drug development process there are a lot of things that Farah can do and does um and in all these different phases first of all we fund basic research we try to understand the disease as much as we can we try to identify all those Pathways that are targetable by drugs and we try to get as many as do as possible because as I mentioned earlier there&amp;#39;s going to be attrition um then we support preclinical development by mostly by try to um develop better tools for academic investigators for drug development developers to test these drugs and we support also clinical development devel development clinical trials by also trying to develop tools that are important for clinical development like biomarkers or trying to understand the disease the clinical clinical aspects of the disease through the natural the Natural History studies and then we take all this information and we engage with uh the FDA with Regulators to educate them about the disease and about the tools that we have available to develop drugs so getting into a little bit more detail of what we fund as far as um basic reearch research is concerned you&amp;#39;ve seen this depicted earlier how we like to um to um represent the disease as a process that goes from the mutation that you have in in in the DNA inside the cells the GAA repeat expansion in the fxn gene this causes the gene to be silenced this causes the low levels of uh ferin protein inside the cell and this has a lot of different consequences uh inside the cell some of which we know for example mitochondrial dysfunction or oxidative stress um these dysfunction causes the cell not to function well and sometimes to degenerate and obviously when a cell within a tissue doesn&amp;#39;t work properly or degenerate you have also tissue at the um dysfunction at the tissue level at the organ level and this translate into symptoms that all the um the fa patients experienc so this is what we know about the disease generally but we need to know every what happens at every single step and we need to learn as much as possible about all these different steps because every single step is a therapeutic opportunity so what are the outstanding questions uh in all these different steps that corre ciz the disease how does the GAA the expansion occur we still don&amp;#39;t have a clear answer there how are is the GAA um silencing the gene once once again something that we still we have some answer but not all the answers um what is the function of rxin we know that one of the function of AR taxin the main function as far as we know now is to produce this iron suoc cluster that are co-actors important for a lot of enzymes inside the cells but we now know that there might be other function of fraxin so what are these other functions um then what are all the consequence that uh when fxing is lost what are the consequence inside the cells um and what causes the dysfunction or the cell death once fexin is lost for example one important question that we have is why are only certain uh cell types affected why are only heart cells and brain cells affected and not skin cells or blood cells um another important question is what happens at the at the organ levels what happens to the brain what happened to the heart and are there um developmental components of the disease so are there changes in the disease for example in the brain that uh happens even before um a person is born and finally we don&amp;#39;t know a lot about some of the symptoms for example fatigue um a very important symptoms for for faers but we don&amp;#39;t know why fers experience fatigue what are the molecular mechanism behind fatigue and we don&amp;#39;t even know exactly how to measure it and these are some of the examples of grants that we have funded in the last few months that try to address all these questions and as you can see there we try to address every single one as much as possible to cover all the different questions as much as possible we have grants from um investigators for example under nuis week at at D ni who&amp;#39;s trying to find out why the GAA repeats are expanding he has a method to uh visualize the repeat inside the cells and is trying to use that to understand more about why the repeats are getting longer and longer um then we have grants that tackle the uh silencing San bandani is one of the expert in FA who&amp;#39;s looking at um gene silencing her grad student Morgan tacket as a grant to to elucidate that um and then we have other grants that tackle um the function of for taxing and Angela xong at at Boston College she is another GR student who&amp;#39;s looking at um what proteins are changing in the cell when fraxin is changing so what other protein besides fxing are affected by fxing LW and then Don Joseph at chop is looking at brain circuits what happens to the brain connectivity uh how the neurons connect to each other when fexin is low um Lucy hamt is with um Helen poo um in France and she&amp;#39;s looking at that last question one of the last question that I mentioned are there neurodevelopmental changes in FAA together with neurodegenerative changes and how does that affect the disease preclinical research what do we do about um developing those tools for preclinical research um we try to develop cell models um and this is an area where your contribution was fundamental because you the one who gave those skin biopsies and our our um investigators found a way to transform those skin biopsies into stem cells and from those stem cells we can make uh the uh cells that are more affected in in FAA heart cells brain cells that then investigator can use to study the disease they can also not only make the cells but they can also make like human tissue or human organ in a in a tissue they called organoids mini heart mini brains in a dish where they that they can use to to test uh drugs and also animal models as I said um we need animal models to to test whether a drug um is um has some efficacy and whether a drug is safe before we can put it in into a person and and then we we can we also um uh fund the development of some essays like a potency essay for drugs these are three very good example of grants that we have funded in the last month or so um from Three Investigators on developing those tools Esther back at the University of Oxford she&amp;#39;s making those mini brains actually she&amp;#39;s making mini Cal in a dish to test drugs and study what happens in the cerebellum uh in the human cerebellum um in vitro in a in a tube um shanon boy at University of Florida she&amp;#39;s making a new mouse model for FAA specifically a mouse model of vision loss in FAA because she wants to um to test a therapy a gin therapy for vision loss and Rob Wilson is making a fish model of a fa I know it&amp;#39;s a little bit weird but sometimes we need to um we need to use different animals different animal models to recapitulate all the different aspects of a fa fa is a very complex disease there are mul multi-tissue M multiple tissues that are affected and sometimes using mice is not enough and we need a different animal to test what we cannot recapitulate in uh in mice obviously animals are not people so it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s hard that find the one model that represents fa fully and finally um what do we f as far as you know helping clinical research helping clinical trials um biomarker uh development is is you know an important aspect we try to fund uh research that develops new biomarkers for fa you probably all have heard about track FAA this big study International stud that um uh follows measures the the brain and the spinal cord in people with a fa over time to try to see if that represents the progression of the disease and and maybe see if that measure can be used in clinical trial to test if a if a drug is effective or not and that&amp;#39;s a biomarker and the natural history study once again this is a this is a part of research where your contribution is ESS Central as Jen mentioned earlier um our the clinical um the natural history study is now uh being the F the uh us nation natural history study is now being um um unified with that&amp;#39;s the name of the study uh with the um uh European natural history study so the the new uh study is going to be called unify um and uh it&amp;#39;s going to be run through a International um Consortium of centers that is the FCC and you see over oops didn&amp;#39;t mean to do that but you see over here all the centers all over the world that are involved in this um in this multinational study um examples of um uh grants that tackle all those question biomarkers uh and um some of the measure the outcome measures that we can um um utilize in clinical trials um the first one is a collaboration between a Brazilian um researcher and um um an investigators in Australia and in this case uh these investigator are investigators are trying to use AI artificial intelligence to develop uh an automated method to read MRI scans of people of cerebell of people um Eric W and sub subani at the University of Florida are trying to develop a tool to measure F taxin directly in the um cereal spinal um fluid of people um and they think this this could be a way to um determine whether F taxin changes in the ceros spinal fluid also represent changes that occur in the brain and finally Louis Corbin this is another grand that was funded in the last year or so she&amp;#39;s trying to find measures that are useful for Pediatric trials you&amp;#39;ve heard I mean you&amp;#39;re all interested in um in uh when uh pediatric trials are are um um are going to be when trials that that apply to children will be are going to be available for CH to Children um and but it&amp;#39;s important to have tools that we can use for children and right now we have for example as uh a measure of clinical outcome the M fars but we don&amp;#39;t know if the M fars is as useful for children as it is in adults because it measure some of the activities that uh are still developing in children like gate for example and so um we need specific tools for younger um younger faers and also we fund some of uh very early drug development efforts um late stages we we leave to the to the drug developments biotech and pharmaceutical companies but um we also like to fund very early stage uh drug development and um these are some of the examples Bernard d d and Javier Santos in France and in Argentina are trying to find drugs that can substitute for fraxin function in the cell and also we found um some uh proposals that are looking at drugs that are being developed in other diseases uh for example uh DMD Duan uh to treat the heart for example um and this investigator think that these drugs can be potentially applied to fa can be efficacious also in fa uh and so so we trying to we fund them to um provide evidence that these drugs are indeed a good could potentially be good drug for fa as well and so this is you know the sum of all the research effort uh of um that uh far has funded over the years of course the approval of omv is one of them you&amp;#39;ve heard from Jen that a Farah funded the foundational science that allow uh for a rational to use omav in in FA um and our our treatment pipeline uh that represents uh where all the um funding effort um from Farah funding research basic research some kind of um translational research uh went and this is the result of it um and what I oops I wanted to if you if we go back to uh that our presentation of the disease as a process um our ultimate goal is to understand these different steps and to um and as I mentioned earlier all these different steps are therapeutic opportunity so we want to fill all these boxes for these different steps with as many um approaches therapeutic Avenues as possible um so that&amp;#39;s my intro and I wanted to introduce to you now they are fair fellows these are um well were supposed to be four but unfortunately Chan Fang is is sick so it&amp;#39;s just three of them but these are um young investigators who have dedicated their early careers to studying fa um we um we give an an award this is the first year that we give this award the farra fellow award that um allows them to um to uh interact with with other investigators with more senior investigators kind of raise their profile a little bit help their career um and also uh participate to um conferences research conferences or also conference like this one where they can interact with um with the patient community so I&amp;#39;ll in introduce the first speaker is suj Chandra she is at Stanford and she&amp;#39;s going to talk about a little bit of her research okay hi everyone my name is suoi I am a postar at Stanford in Dr shinan wangs lab um so the main focus of my research is uh the cellular or molecular basis of fa with the aim to identify mitochondrial Pathways that that are altered in pexia patients and that can be targeted using small molecule drugs so I um use these fa induced PL poent stem cils or ipscs that are generated by genetically reprogramming the skin cells that uh that are derived from patients and we also then edit them to get an isogenic control ibscs and then I further differentiate them into Sensory neurons and cardiomyocytes which are the most uh as we know are the two most important types of cells that are affected in fa so using these two model from the same uh patient derived ipscs I am conducting a global uh unbiased proteomic study uh to identify proteins that are altered in FA patients compared to the control and also to see if these Pathways mitochondrial Pathways and the proteins are cell type specific so I will just uh show you uh just briefly uh the models that I have uh generated in the lab so on the the left you can see the sensory neurons that I have differentiated from ipscs so it takes about a month to uh differentiate them so I first generate these neural cresles that you see uh in a that are um that expresses so 10 then I further differentiate them into Sensory neurons and uh these Sensory neurons are also proprioceptive and they express per valine and peripherin and all the other markers um on the right you can can see a cardiomyo side model that I have developed so uh it&amp;#39;s very cool uh for me to see that these cells actually beat in the culture after you uh successfully cultured them for a certain time uh so yeah I&amp;#39;m just using these two models from the same patient and conducting a few uh promic studies um uh and then I just wanted to briefly talk about another U um focus of my research so here we are targeting uh the oxidative stress in fa uh as um I think Barbara and uh some of the other speakers in the morning they discussed uh oxidative stress is a very prominent feature of fa and we want to Target it by using a molecule called we we call it MR3 that our lab has already discovered and tested in a Parkinson&amp;#39;s disease model so we are targeting this pathway called The Mix 60 Miro one pathway my it&amp;#39;s the mitochondrial pathway so uh the protein Meo one is actually a outer mitochondrial membrane protein uh so what it does it it helps the mitochondria to move on the microtubules inside the cell and also when this meor protein is removed from the surface of the mitochondria that acts as a signal for those damaged mitochondria to be uh degraded by mitophagy so uh removal of Meo is sort of a way for the cells to ensure that it is only keeping functioning functioning healthy mitochondria and it is degrading the damaged ones so uh in FA or in PD when there is high level of reactive oxygen species present in the cell what happens is it causes a confirmational change of a pro of a inner mitochondrial membrane protein called mix 60 which then further binds more Miro protein and stabilizes the complex so since there are more Meo present on the damage mitochondria they can no longer be uh degraded by mitophagy so what happens is there are more damaged mitochondria that keeps accumulating in the neurons and the kyom myoides and further causes death of those cells so I am using um using the two models I described I am using uh this miror reducer 3 compound that our lab has to see if it has any beneficial effects on both of these models um that&amp;#39;s a brief overview of what I&amp;#39;m doing and I would like to thank far for uh inviting us to participate here and uh our lab is at Stanford and uh thank you so much for your time okay we we&amp;#39;ll take question at the end so I&amp;#39;m going to uh ask Shan Guan she&amp;#39;s at Colombia hello everyone my name is shaan I come from Columbia University uh I&amp;#39;m very happy to be here to share my research progress in FA and also very happy to hear your question your stories so I&amp;#39;ll give you brief introduction on my project my mentor is Dr Sean Neil here he is and our live focus on using multiple IP genetic editing tool to rescue the this after having this you must have question what is epig gentic editing tool let&amp;#39;s see this picture you could see my pointer the green one so the blue color the double strand Helix curl line that is our DNA is the carrier of our genetic information what is genetic information it&amp;#39;s include like your skin color or you like the case of P or will you be allergic to diarhea or some other food that&amp;#39;s a genetic level except the D you can see there are also some modification on the D like the orange one here we call it&amp;#39;s D mulation and also there are prople Circle that&amp;#39;s a hone which is used for DNA to WRA on it make the DNA very condense because you we strange our DNA to a straight line it will be 2 meter I say very small right so to make sure our cell can hold this long DNA it should be very complex kind like WRA on this hisone you can you can see in the hisone there are little tail and there are some chemical group on it it also uh can regulate this kind of DNA function this kind of modification can record our life Behavior like how many XI you did every week what kind of food you eat also can record your environment so this kind epigenetic uh information is is won&amp;#39;t affect our D sequence it&amp;#39;s just a modification of the DNA but it can affect D&amp;#39;s function for example it can regulate the Gene&amp;#39;s function you is not correct it may cause some disease so the main character of the epigenetic is rible which mean we can rewrite this kind of epigenetic information for ourself how to cheve this to CH this go our lab develop a Chris C9 based on tool which we call Ig gentic Iden tool Chris pro9 is a very fancy technology in the U modern science uh field and it&amp;#39;s won the Nobel Prize in 2020 uh because of the limitation of time I want to introduce more you you have interest uh we can talk later and our lab adapt this tool to fion with some writer or eraser or our or the Imp IG gentic information so that we can CH write some information there all also remove some information for example we we can add the with some like this orange uh modification like we can consider as a hat for the DNA also you can say the one in the purple one we can consider as a scarf for the DNA sequence our lab have successfully appli this kind of adding tool to very specific and also very accurate to edit our epigenetic information especially in patient then we can correct it to a health condition we have apply this tool in multiple disease like red syndrome and also file X syndrome then how we apply it to fragile te taxia so as you may already know in the genetic level the fral txia was called by the mutation in the gene FX is a repeat region or expanded that&amp;#39;s where let the uh genes product the FR taxin from in the patient uh cells the product level very low except the genetic level we also check the epigenetic level for example in the left side is the epigenetic modification in patient and the right side is the house people&amp;#39;s epigenetic information for example you say DM mulation level you can in the DNA in the patient it have little hat that we call D mulation modification it just some chemical group but in the house people we don&amp;#39;t have this hat on your DNA and also we can say in the hone level there are some scarf we call hone estation in the health people but we couldn&amp;#39;t find this kind of modification couldn&amp;#39;t find the scarf in the patient cells so here is our question is this IG Genet difference will affect the fragen test you we can rewrite this EP gen information could we rescue this disease so we have a test in the cells so for the DM solution to remove the head from DNA we have to which name a Dean T you don&amp;#39;t need to remember this complex uh scientific term you just remember it&amp;#39;s a eraser of your or head or the DNA sequence and they also we have specific tool to add a scarf on the histone we call it DCP F1 p300 you just remember it&amp;#39;s a writer or the scarf to your DNA so we apply this tool in the uh fral taia patient derived ipsa uh here I want really want to appreciate uh our patient donate this for for the research it&amp;#39;s really helpful and also we uh first we successfully edit the ipsa we then we evaluate after this kind of edit did it rescue the expression level of fexin because that&amp;#39;s a very important Gene for for the fragen tesia also we want to evaluate after this kind editing where the cells function like the mitochondria function or also the neurons activity was really rescued or not here is some our very preliminary data you can say let&amp;#39;s say the first uh first bar on the left there are three bar the very L one is our goal that&amp;#39;s house people&amp;#39;s effect sense expression level the middle bar is the patient expression level so we know where we show the m to then let&amp;#39;s see how our tools works you can see the very right bar that&amp;#39;s our uh DNA mulation edting tool which to remove the head from the DNA sequence you can see it increase a little bit like roughly 1.7 for Change and also we use other tool to add the SC to your hone uh we use it both in ipsc also in the neuron cell we can s roughly twofold increase we are very exciting to solve this result because that mean dation hist modification this can EP genetic information is did involved in the fragen testas progress and we can use our tool to rill this kind of disease meanwhile we also noted there still some space we can improve control to make our tool works better to rescue the ex PR level more higher to chill the health controls group uh in the future we are trying to first we are trying to optimize this tool meanwhile you can see the different tool for example add the scarf or remove the Hat both works but how about you we more them together well it&amp;#39;s both resue efficiency we are trying on that SC so last but not least I want to pre is the fal spot to our study and I also want to preure our excellent collaborator professor jini and her team at columia University and also I want to pess our L member uh here oh sorry this all our L thank you thank you so much all right let me advance sorry I&amp;#39;m not qualified to give this presentation oh here it is all right so next is PU Yogo is from UT Southwest University of Texas thank you it&amp;#39;s a big deal to speak uh after a great scientist like my co- fellow and I will try anyway okay I&amp;#39;m glad to present my project using antisense oligonucleotide against fa what is antisense oligonucleotide AO it&amp;#39;s uh this green piece one it&amp;#39;s a short nuclear acid molecule that can be used to Target specific region of a and through this mechanism they can inhib or increase gen expression and because they can mod at the level of the protein that are used as drug and the action require high complimentarity with the target seconds makes them more specific compared to the conventional drugs also by chemical modification we can increase the stability and some may be administrated just two or three times a years this kind of drug can be quickly developed and can be specified for patient with rare ation and for all this reason uh this approach has developed to have a Innovative drugs against cancers and genetic disease and the USA FDA approved some encouraging the initiation of new project my job is to investigate a therapeutic approach for fa using anti-sense oligo nucleotide how yam lab as a uh reported the presence of aan M in the cells of the patient with J expansion and this aberant uh mRNA is named here fraxin ET and during the transcription of the frataxin Gen we have also this Aban one who can decrease the level of the normal frine so we hypothesize that it&amp;#39;s possible to use Azo to decrease his level and increase the level of the normal M by using anti hcle to block the S Exon how it work after the transcription we have the prea with the Exon and the Antron and this praya need to be sped into the Mata and we can use use AO to Target the prea and disrupting the reconnection by displacing factors so instead to have two mRNA if we target the SP Mna we will have only a normal one a single one and to test the feasibility of our approach we design an AO targeting a normal Mr and we observe a reduction of this Mr in uh the cells of patient providing proof that it&amp;#39;s possible to use this approach to reduce Mr on frine gen currently uh I am testing around 15 AO targeting principally the SED Exon to decrease his level in the patient hoping to have the best one for future therapeutic I current to my experiment on passan fa blast NPCs before the ultimate uh on most model brain this will be uh my little contribution to our Victory against fa my name is PU yo I am in Dr Mara lab as a post do may receive his greeting thank you Farah for your support thank you everyone great thank you um are there any questions for regarding research funding or to our very talented young investigators regarding their projects or um maybe we can start by you told us a little bit about yourself um how did you end up working on fa start um yeah so uh I am a fifth uh fifth year post actually but my PhD training and also my uh first postar at UCLA both were on Alzheimer&amp;#39;s disease and Parkinson&amp;#39;s disease and when I joined uh Dr W&amp;#39;s Lab at Stanford we had uh just received a grant from far and since Parkinson&amp;#39;s disease and uh Fredrick&amp;#39;s attacks are share a lot of common phenotypes like the accumulation of iron calcium imbalances and just both uh both have really prominent mitochondrial uh uh phenotypes uh so I ended up working uh for Frederick saaia uh right now I am the uh only person in our lab that is working on fa and I&amp;#39;m very excited to uh you know develop all these uh models and really thanks to uh you guys for providing us with all the uh skin cells and everything that we can um engineer to um get many very important cell types that really helps our research yeah thank you say something hi um actually I&amp;#39;m person totally in a different field before I start the fragen tax project I&amp;#39;m in the epig gentic field to say how this epig genetic in fact information affect our health and disease our lab focus on multiple brain disease as I mentioned earlier like Str syndrome and also the fragile X syndrome as you may know lot of brain disease associated with this kind of repeat expandation so it&amp;#39;s very in to understand why all the brain disease most of brain disease social this kind the mutation right and also our collaborator Journey share the sh in the fragen TF and they found each other to say how about we apply this epet adding tool in the fragen taxia because we have some very successfully example in other disease so that&amp;#39;s why how I started this project yeah thank you I came from Bina fasu to Canada only to learn molecular biology and during this PhD my topic was on fa with Dr Jac Petr in Laval University and I use uh chrisper C9 to delete the GAA repeat and during my PhD I have contact with the patient for example I saw the patient making the tour of soraa river to raise money for research that touch me and I decided to continue in this way if I have opportunity and M give me the opportunity to come his LA and to be a post do so I am very glad to contribute for something in this disease thank you yeah timeline yeah so uh we uh just it really depends on um uh how fast we can for at least for me how fast we can get the cells that we need for our uh different experiments so right now I am uh working with these two models the sensory neuron and the cardiomyocytes which takes about one month to just get one round of differentiation done so it&amp;#39;s definitely a little time consuming but uh yeah we are hoping to finish this in the next uh one year or so because uh that will be my end of post talk also hopefully at Stanford so yeah we are hoping we are already done with uh one of our proteomic screen in the sensory neurons so we hope to see very um exciting data from there and we will move for forward with that yeah uh I start this project from one years ago uh as you may know this kind of tour is very specific to specific Gene you can design whatever Gene you can Target so we Design This into this specific FX engine and apply it to ipsc and also apply to neuron which is our final goal it&amp;#39;s uh the data I show here kind like one year&amp;#39;s work and in the future first side will keep on working on this model to make it works better meanwhile we also try to apply to the mouse expent to see well it&amp;#39;s working in wable condition then it&amp;#39;s more close to the clinical treatment so uh hard for me to give the ex exactly time like when could we successfully successfully CH this goals but we are working at it and hopefully we can have some clinical application as soon as possible thank you I am a three Monon postdoc researcher and uh uh for my project to inv vitro until invivo we playing for two or three years but during this period we will also do another thing like uh the patient with point mutation we also want to use AO to uh try to find a therapeutic thank you so so first I want to congratulate everyone um because you have some really great science and really um proposing some really great um experiments I had a specific question for uh Johan about your uh crisper strategy on the timeline the initro timeline you presented um you&amp;#39;re going to perform the editing at the ipsc stage before differentiation yes is there a plan um or is it possible to try this strategy after the cells have been uh fully differentiated into their uh Target adult cell type yeah definitely uh first we are try on the ipsa is kind of like stem cell of the the the the the fragen taxia patient stem cell so after way we can choose this kind of editing in the stem cell later we can always differentiate this this cell to like neurons or the heart cells which is we really want to Cho this kind of editing and the other side we also trying to directly edit in the you know differential cell like neuron cell and heart cell that&amp;#39;s more close to the clinical uh uh application that&amp;#39;s what we are working on yeah thank you anybody else if not I just want to thank again these wonderful young investigators they&amp;#39;re so talented thank you so much for working on",

for a lot of different fa awareness events and I&amp;#39;ve gotten to hear the stories of a lot of different people with fa or parents of kids with fa and this panel is very similar um we&amp;#39;re going to let our panelists here tell us about themselves tell us about their experiences and hopefully everyone here can gain some insight whether you&amp;#39;re new to the community or you&amp;#39;ve been in the community for a very long time so we&amp;#39;re going to have our panelists start off by introducing themselves and I think we&amp;#39;ll just go right down the line and you&amp;#39;ll also see some pictures of them up there so Britney do you want to start us off okay yeah so my name is Britney Summerfield as you can see I&amp;#39;m from Mata Canada and Don can you guys hear okay yeah Britney Summerfield from matoba Canada I&amp;#39;m 29 years old I was diagnosed with fa when I was 13 years old so 16 years ago and so in my family I have me my sister Carly who is a carrier and then I also have another sister Chelsea who has fa as well thanks Britney Brandon you wantan to go yep hi it&amp;#39;s nice to meet you guys my name is Brendan Halverson I am from Battle Creek Michigan I am I am I&amp;#39;m currently 22 years old and I was diagnosed at 10 years old I have a 15-year-old sister who also has fa and I just got my associates degree in science and I plan to attend Western Michigan University to study biology next semester and something interesting about me is I like to play adaptive Sports so a picture I have up there is slud hockey my entire family gets together once a month and we go to the ice rink and play that I also I also do ride taex yeah I was at the ride yesterday and I also ride in Chicago and I&amp;#39;ve also tried adaptive curling and we tennis I&amp;#39;m also I also enjoy soccer so I&amp;#39;m excited for the chance to try wheelchair sacer eventually thanks Conor or sorry Brandon thanks brandan and we&amp;#39;re moving on to Connor so I&amp;#39;m Connor Sweeny I&amp;#39;m from womon New Jersey um I&amp;#39;m also 22 I was diagnosed when I was eight um so this been a lot going through with elementary school and all those other schools um I am currently in college right now um for sustainability um and there&amp;#39;s no one else in my family with fa except a cousin of mine who is a carrier so yeah thanks Conor and now we have Gretchen hopefully hopefully this is working can you hear me um I&amp;#39;m Gretchen Anderson I um obviously I&amp;#39;m a parent um I have two sons uh one of you see one of them there that Sean he&amp;#39;s my older son he has friedricks uh he was symptomatic at 15 and well he noticed it first took a while for us to notice it um he was diagnosed at 16 and a half He&amp;#39;s 33 now um my other son does not have Fredricks uh we&amp;#39;re like most families we&amp;#39;re you know the first time we heard friedricks was when the neurologist said that&amp;#39;s what I think he has there&amp;#39;s no history of it either side of our family um my personal hobby as you can uh that&amp;#39;s me with the Pierre I&amp;#39;m for 14 years I&amp;#39;ve been a volunteer at a therapeutic horse writing place um has nothing really to do with Shawn I wanted to do this before sea even had symptoms and Shawn is actually not interested in that his interest his hobby is fishing um if ID had a really good picture of him fishing I would have put it in there so um yeah so he if you if you want to be friends with Sean talk fishing he will talk about it with you forever so that&amp;#39;s our starting thank you J okay so we have a couple different topics we&amp;#39;re gonna ask our panelists about and kind of the first broad theme is how many different transitions you go through in life um whether you have fa or you don&amp;#39;t but when you do have fa in your family there are some specific transition periods that you might go through and the first is when you&amp;#39;ve just gotten a diagnosis and you have to kind of learn learn to transition and learn to get used to that diagnosis and maybe meet a whole new community so we&amp;#39;re going to ask our panelists first looking back when they were first diagnosed do they have any advice that they would give themselves at the time that they were diagnosed so we&amp;#39;re going to go to Britney to answer that question okay yeah so I was diagnosed back when I was 13 years old it was only a year after I was diagnosed with croh disease which you may have heard of um and I figured it was kind of similar to Crohn&amp;#39;s I figured there was a magical medication I could take and go into Room Mission my parents my family was all devastated they were shattered and I didn&amp;#39;t understand it they told me not to look it up so I chose not to but eventually of course I got curious and I did it took a while because it all the words I found online scared me I closed the web page every time I saw something I didn&amp;#39;t like wheelchair early death vision loss I was scared it took me a good I would say about five years before I finally accepted the disease I would start actually telling people friends and family and they would accept it and help me and yeah so I would pretty much just say to my thir 1-year-old self that it&amp;#39;s going to take time to accept the disease it&amp;#39;s not like prones it&amp;#39;s going to have its upside downs but ultimately there&amp;#39;s going to be things that will help um and you can still be happy thanks Britney Connor do you have advice that you would give to someone who was just diagnosed with fa um yeah so for me or I would say keep your friends close to you because for me I was diagnosed when I was eight so I had all the elementary school friends like people that I me through like baseball and stuff because I have two older brothers so I was always involved in that type stuff um so um keeping your friends close to you because once the schools start to Branch out and you get to like Middle School and High School you start making other friends and if you fall behind you&amp;#39;ll never gag up um but when I did was I stayed active and I tried different sports even later on after I was in a wheelchair um and I joined the track team at school because we were able to get a like throwing chair so I could throw Javin and meet friends that way um yeah so I would say just keep putting yourself out there and eventually you will find friends thank you Connor Brendan you are an older brother and you&amp;#39;ve witnessed your siblings get diagnosed with fa after you so what advice have you given your sister yep so looking back when I was diagnosed in middle school and then going into high school I do have summer GRS I think of with my diagnosis I try to portray this to my sister and advisor to make the right choices um the biggest things I think were to make sure you&amp;#39;re staying active and um doing stuff now that you won&amp;#39;t be able to down the road so you won&amp;#39;t have any regrets later on and for example um playing sports was something that was really cool to me and I can&amp;#39;t play competitive Sports now so I&amp;#39;ve talked to her about that all the time and she&amp;#39;s actually on the High School competitive swim team right now that&amp;#39;s something really exciting to see her do that and the other thing I like to talk to we about is not to let judgment hold her back like having to use accessibility AIDS like Walkers or wheelchairs I was all always really afraid of getting judgment for that but growing up I realize it doesn&amp;#39;t really matter in fact I think it shows who your real friends are in fact I&amp;#39;m actually here in Philadelphia right now with one of my friends who&amp;#39;s been there for me for about five [Music] years thank you Gretchen do you want to give us some advice from the parents perspective sure and unlike Dave Lynch I will succumb to wearing the reading glasses so um so this is for mostly the parents uh first of all parents if you haven&amp;#39;t joined fpg you need to do that um I think they&amp;#39;re going to have the the log or the URL up there um so do it right away um it stands for the friederick SAT taxia parents group um and I mean sign up for it because it&amp;#39;s an invaluable resource for you um parents I&amp;#39;ve been a member since 2008 um it no matter what question you have someone&amp;#39;s been there before you and has an answer for you um It&amp;#39;s a Wonderful tight-nit group of people um I&amp;#39;ve learned so much from them um in fact uh you know they&amp;#39;re up to date on all the information coming out from Farah like like before it even gets sent to emails and stuff and so um they&amp;#39;re a great group so please join it um more before I get to the more sobering part of my response I just want to say that with the approval of Sky Claris and today&amp;#39;s crowded Farah pipeline um the future looks much brighter than my son was diagnosed in 2007 when he was diagnosed there was ionone was getting ready to do a phase three trial and um Mark Payne was working on T for taxin which is now you know as part of laramar um and so it was there was really very Lally almost nothing out there and now they can hardly fit everything in so so it&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s so much hope now um so in fact the neurologist that diagnosed Sean which wasn&amp;#39;t Dr Lynch was older and um he said that he firmly believed within his lifetime that there would be a cure for friedricks the first thing my husband and I wanted to ask him was how old was he and how long he planned on living and hopefully it wasn&amp;#39;t too long but so he was this was way before there was a lot of stuff out there that really gave us hope um so I wanted to talk a little bit about how you walk the journey right with your child and and how you stay you know people ask well how do you stay strong and not fall apart you know family and friends and and this is what I say I don&amp;#39;t know what is going to happen with Sean because there are too many variables Sean never had scoliosis but he has a bad heart and he with his repeats he shouldn&amp;#39;t have had a bad heart so you just don&amp;#39;t know what&amp;#39;s going to happen so I don&amp;#39;t know what&amp;#39;s going to happen I I know what may happen and I look to the possible future Futures to just sort of stay ahead of the apal to know what he may need you know as things change um so I don&amp;#39;t get stuck with like oh he needs a wheelchair and we haven&amp;#39;t even looked into that yet so I know that I do sometimes slip to Imagining the possible scary scary scary future right which is becoming less possible as time goes on thank god um but I don&amp;#39;t live there and the reason I you know things happen Shawn loses an ability um when sha had dilated cardiomyopathy in his early 20s I was that was a time when I was like oh God here we go um when another parent loses a child especially when you&amp;#39;ve known for a long time those are all things that make you kind of spin into that future for a little while and so this is the important thing to remember you want to visit the future or possible Futures enough to know to be prepared for possible issues oh we need a super pole oh we need this but you don&amp;#39;t want to live there living in the worst possible future in your mind is crazy making and nobody can survive that and the worst thing about living in that possible future and not bringing yourself back to the present you know and that future may or may not occur is that you lose all of your today and that would be the biggest tragedy of all so live today with your beautiful child make tons and tons and tons of memories um one of the many wise things that a parent told us in fpg was your child is never healthier than they are today he was asked he a parent was asking should I do a trip now should I wait till later maybe you know when we get over this and he says no do it now do it now right and you know what here comes down the pike oh you have a ton of beautiful memories and you get more opportunities to do more things with your kid right so you know you&amp;#39;ll you&amp;#39;ll figure it out don&amp;#39;t worry excessively about the you know if you&amp;#39;re taking a trip the blips that will occur the accessibility blips they do you know like bathroom you know the the um trying to get on an airplane um you know but Fredick parents are pretty pretty much mcgyver they can make anything work right you know on the you know they can make an accessible bathroom out of a porta regular porta potty okay it can be done don&amp;#39;t be afraid to do it because you&amp;#39;re like oh how am I going to how am I going to manage to get him on the bus how am I going to manage to get him to the museum how am I going to manage all this stuff you&amp;#39;ll figure it out and people are much more willing to help you just passers by than you would think so do it now um and you know when this cure comes down and you&amp;#39;re like well we did everything early well again you have an opportunity to make more money or more money excuse me well you could but more experiences and in my book that&amp;#39;s a win-win thanks gr okay so we&amp;#39;re going to continue in the theme of that transition period you&amp;#39;ve just gotten a new diagnosis of fa you might have never heard of fa before and suddenly you&amp;#39;re faced with a whole community of people that you never know you could be a part of and for some people that support right away is really helpful and for other people that might be a little too overwhelming at first so Britney can you tell us how you navigated joining the fa Community after your diagnosis okay so it took a while of course as I said before it took five years but reach acceptance but I start clinical trials right off the bat I guess I&amp;#39;ve heard people use the word clinical trial junkie that&amp;#39;s what I am too I do a lot of Trials um so I started those pretty much a year after I was was diagnosed and then about 5 years later I did a trial in Atlanta Georgia where I met another fa patient I had previously gone to some Naf events and we met some people but never really got oneon-one time with anyone with fa and they told me about phah so I decided to look it up online and they were searching for something called B that was back in 20 16 or 2015 I joined the program pretty much right away I attended my first Symposium in 2017 and since then I have pretty much loved it I&amp;#39;ve fallen in love with the community so I have some notes I&amp;#39;m gonna look at and yeah so I&amp;#39;m the an ambassador on the leadership team I&amp;#39;m the leader of the blog team I&amp;#39;m the co-leader of the fa hangout team I do some work with the toxia Canada I&amp;#39;ve participate in Trials all over I this is now my fifth Symposium I&amp;#39;ve been to some nap symposiums I love it I couldn&amp;#39;t imagine my life without it thanks okay the last transition we&amp;#39;re going to talk about is the transition from walking to using different kinds of Mobility AIDS so Connor do you want to tell us a bit about what that was like for you yeah so in the elementary school I tried walking for as long as I could but I would fall down like all the time the point where they W me to wear a helmet but they weren&amp;#39;t liable if I got hurt um so I started using a electric scooter in like fourth grade and that lasted about a year my friends liked it um we could play games and stuff with it but I couldn&amp;#39;t really uh been that under any debt so so I got a manual wheelchair by the start of sixth grade um so the manual chair was really good until my energy started to drop a little bit um and the one I couldn&amp;#39;t really push the way that I used to I got a fun drive um mostly used for like Outdoors stuff like on grass just Ping On gr not fun um and then at the beginning of college I got a will uh you know um Kyle Bryant has um so that was um it&amp;#39;s good but I don&amp;#39;t really I&amp;#39;m still not a fan of my arms just not doing anything and kind of just sitting there so I mostly use the SP drive or around school still but I can use the will whenever on need to thank you okay Britney&amp;#39;s gonna tell us a little bit about her transition as well uh yeah so like most I was pretty adamant against using anything I lasted until I graduated high school and then I started using a walker I really liked it it showed people I walk like I do for a reason I wasn&amp;#39;t just drunk or lumsy or something I there was a reason for my walking and then I guess it was about 5 years later I started using a wheelchair it was meant to be only a temporary thing I had surgery and it was for recovery but I thrived in the transition I really loved it it made me more independent made me faster I could get from point A to B without falling it just it was great great and I don&amp;#39;t regret the transition at all I hear people say a lot use your legs and what do people say um sorry gonna look at my notes um yeah people say use it or lose it a lot with fa and I love to have my Walker kept my leg strong but I don&amp;#39;t regret my transition thank yeah well done we&amp;#39;ve got a very supportive audience okay so our next kind of overarching theme we&amp;#39;re going to talk about is different kinds of relationships and interacting with different people when you have fa and we heard from Britney how great it is to be part of the fa Community especially because it&amp;#39;s really people who understand exactly what you&amp;#39;re going through but at the opposite end of that spectrum is people who you might meet out in public who have absolutely absolutely no idea what fa is and I know Gretchen has a lot of stories she can tell about those types of situations so do you want to tell us a little bit about that Gretchen so feel I don&amp;#39;t know I may just have to yell okay there we go um so we&amp;#39;re huge on awareness in our family I mean Fredick is a rare disease right we all know this and that&amp;#39;s only because we know someone with friedricks but the general population knows nothing about Fredick and in fact the pro I mean Fredick is most common hereditary attacka out there and it&amp;#39;s still rare for example when we go to ERS which when Sean was walking usually involved but walking like a drunk sailor usually involved um two in the morning when the bars closed and the people with all the injuries from being at the bars who were drunk were in the ER unfortunately um and we&amp;#39;d go there and we&amp;#39;d be like to the ER doctor hey um Sean has Fredrick&amp;#39;s a taxia how much do you know about friedrick a taxia and generally they would say well I learned about something about it in medical school but maybe you could refresh me so like if doctors don&amp;#39;t really remember friederick you can&amp;#39;t expect the ordinary person to have ever heard of it um an EXA kids and and if you have a kid that&amp;#39;s in their late teens early 20s and still is early 20s and still walking um it&amp;#39;s a very definite Frederick&amp;#39;s walk where you walk kind of wide sort of like you&amp;#39;re drunk you have your wide stance and kind of walking and once I was one time of many I was walking with Shawn and we were in just our local grocery store shopping center area and we walked past Starbucks and Sean was doing his walk and I looked in and I saw a couple not a not a very old couple not a very young couple but a couple looking at him with disgust and that&amp;#39;s because I knew they thought he was drunk or he was high of course he was neither of those and my mama bear was like you know wanting to go say stop staring at him you know just stop judging but as I tell him it&amp;#39;s an opportunity to spread awareness because if you don&amp;#39;t know something exists you won&amp;#39;t care about it and if you don&amp;#39;t care about it you won&amp;#39;t care enough to donate to find a cure so it&amp;#39;s like okay so I don&amp;#39;t think Sean knew at the time that I did this he kept walking but I ran back to the Starbucks I opened the door and they were in the front of the Starbucks I leaned in and said hey I just want to let you know um don&amp;#39;t worry he&amp;#39;s not drunk he&amp;#39;s not High um he just has something called friedrick attack he it&amp;#39;s a genetic neurological condition um I just didn&amp;#39;t want you to worry you know and then I left now the mama bear was like hahaa you&amp;#39;re going to feel guilty but I tried to turn it into something that wouldn&amp;#39;t make them mad right like May that&amp;#39;s a potential donor right there and again we&amp;#39;re huge on that so um and for parents of kids who are newly diagnosed that in their teens I&amp;#39;ve heard from other parents this whole thing of if your teen is in their late teens early 20s and they&amp;#39;re still ambulatory um it&amp;#39;s very common for people to think they&amp;#39;re drunk or they&amp;#39;re high and if I didn&amp;#39;t know about fedix maybe I would think the same thing um but if they look as it at it as a a way to spread awareness and Sean has done this many times he&amp;#39;s had the cops called on him um and you know and they show up and he&amp;#39;s like hey yeah I&amp;#39;m I&amp;#39;m fine I have Frederick&amp;#39;s a taxi in fact his friend with him when he came home um he said yeah someone called the cops thinking I was drunk and um even though he parked in the handicap space but whatever um and I said well did you explain to him I was said okay he goes yeah but his friend he goes he almost got arrested because he was so angry on Sean&amp;#39;s behalf that he just started like spouting off so I was like okay great so um yeah Tre for for people with fa treat this as a a learning opportunity for someone that doesn&amp;#39;t know and those those things you build in your community can the awareness you build and the caring that you build um May pay off later when you&amp;#39;re trying to fund raise thanks scatching so Brendan is going to tell us a little bit about what it was like to share his diagnosis with his classmates at the time so I was diagnosed in fifth grade and I think it is pretty common and understandable that right when I was diagnosed um my whole family was kind of depressed and needed to take about six months just to cope with it and realize this is the life we have to live now but eventually when we came out of that phase we decided it was best to go public with my diagnosis so I remember my family came in and sat down and everyone in my fifth grade class we just answer answered questions explaining what f is and how it&amp;#39;s going to be for me going [Music] forward and I they were all my friends were really supportive of me throughout all of my school years um I remember it would I think it&amp;#39;s up fny story that right when I shared my diagnosis with my classmates all the girls in my class actually made uh duct tape wallets it&amp;#39;s like a fundraiser and all the proceeds went to Farah and throughout the years we did countless other fundraisers the most prominent was my high school dude a 5050 raffle on our homecoming football game and all the proceeds there also went to Farah thanks Brandon and Britney also has some experience talking to others about that thing okay um yes this happens very often and I kind of in all honesty I liked it when people ask it&amp;#39;s much better than when they just stare at me blankly with curious eyes they&amp;#39;re wondering so it&amp;#39;s kind of refreshing when people ask I find it most common with children but I&amp;#39;ll go into that more after um so when people ask me I&amp;#39;m pretty I like to be pretty quick I don&amp;#39;t go into detail I explained I have a disease called Frederick&amp;#39;s Axia usually I don&amp;#39;t say like Progressive or incurable or anything I don&amp;#39;t want like pity looks or anything I explain the signals my brain sent to my body to move just don&amp;#39;t get sent properly um I&amp;#39;ll tell them to look it up if they ask more questions maybe I&amp;#39;ll explain a couple more details if needed but I&amp;#39;m pretty quick with it with children so I volunteer at a local zoo and children ask me quite often what it is what&amp;#39;s wrong with me why I&amp;#39;m in a chair and I&amp;#39;m extra quick and simple with thumb I usually try and keep a smile on my face I just explained my body doesn&amp;#39;t move like their body does and I try and end everything with the smile thank you Britney Okay so those were our discussions with people who don&amp;#39;t know what fa is but there&amp;#39;s also relationships with people in our families so people who are much more familiar with fa so I&amp;#39;d love to have our panelists talk about the relationships with their siblings and Brendan you have a couple siblings so why don&amp;#39;t you tell us about them I am actually the old just have four siblings my there me who&amp;#39;s 22 I have my brother Bryce who just turned 20 years years old and he does not have fa um he&amp;#39;s been he&amp;#39;s like my lifelong friend he&amp;#39;s always been really supportive of me I actually remember the first day of school when I had to use my wheelchair he was there to help me he like walked me into class and he came to check out me he talked me out of my anxiety and I was really I really like that that&amp;#39;s something I won&amp;#39;t forget and now we bond by going to sports games together and we also play uh games like even on our phone which is something small butet bring up intentionally just to say like even this um small things really do go a long way it means a lot as I sorry he&amp;#39;s got a lot more siblings to talk about as I mentioned earlier I do have a sister who also has a b her name is Brooke and I go to her swim competitions and wild swim and I also I give her advice on with fa because she&amp;#39;s in high school right now so I talk to her a lot about that and that she also has a twin brother his name is Brady he is not a he does not have fa but he&amp;#39;s a carer of fa and he actually plays soccer on the high school team so I like to go to all of his soccer games and my family also really likes soccer so I can talk to him a lot about the Sager lingo where what&amp;#39;s going on so yeah I have fun talking to him about that but yeah that&amp;#39;s my family okay now you can clap thank you brenon Britney is going to tell us a little bit about her relationship with her siblings as well so I have Theos to Brendan I&amp;#39;m the youngest I have two older sisters Carly who is five years older and Chelsea who&amp;#39;s three and a half years older Chelsea has fa Cari is a carrier so me and Chelsea are part of the fa Club Carly is not but yeah we make it work so me and Chelsea we have a law common we both have a fa we were diagnosed at the same time our onset was the same time we participate in lots of clinical trials together we travel for conferences together we live together we we&amp;#39;re two peace in a pod pretty much and Carly I&amp;#39;m very close to too I love both my sisters so much but Carly has always been a little left out and she&amp;#39;s felt guilty for being healthy I guess you would say and not part of the club that me and Chelsea are in she feels excluded and left out but after 16 years so it&amp;#39;s been 16 years since I was diagnosed nowadays we have a lot more in common our ages don&amp;#39;t seem so far apart we can actually talk to each other explain everything um she tries to be as helpful as possible she tries to educate herself she can&amp;#39;t really attend conferences and all the appointments I do of course but she ask me all about it all the time she wants to come to appointments with me for trials and stuff which hopefully soon she will be able to and yeah yeah thank you you&amp;#39;re both pretty amazing sisters thank you Britney okay so we have another important relationship to talk about and that&amp;#39;s the relationship between parents and children and we specifically wanted to focus on what it&amp;#39;s like when you&amp;#39;re a young adult with fa or the parent of a young adult with fa and balancing needing help and also the Independence that all young adults want and deserve so Gretchen is going to tell us a little bit about what that is like with her son so um we really try to keep Shawn or or aim to keep Shawn as independent as possible um so really kind of a you&amp;#39;re walking kind of a a thin tight line here trying to be you&amp;#39;re you&amp;#39;re the parent and no one will love your child and take care of them better than you will right you would do anything for them on the other side you are their parent so there&amp;#39;s all those kind of Dynamics between parents and kids when you&amp;#39;re also a caretaker um as I said for us we try to leave them as independent as possible obviously over time that&amp;#39;s changed um Sean drove Sean drove until two years ago um and that was great I mean I have a lot of parents that ask on on the parents group like should I let my kid try to drive they want to try yeah absolutely let them try to drive if they can they can if they can&amp;#39;t that&amp;#39;s okay but like they should be able to try to do that while they still can because that gave Sean a huge feeling of Independence that he could get himself from one place to the other he wasn&amp;#39;t depending on us to help him you know take him fishing take him to his doctor appointments although some of the the medical doctor appointments we would go to um we could go visit friends he could take he drove to school um and and that really increased his quality of life and I know a lot of people have kids that won&amp;#39;t be able to do this but the point is let them try if they want to um as time has gone on we&amp;#39;ve stepped into to do more and more stuff um shaa once asked me and parents are all different you know well Dad when my husband retired a few years ago um he retired to help take care of Shawn and also to spend time with him it was after his his diagnosis of um dilated cardiomyopathy and so he he goes well Dad does more stuff for me he just does it and and and then you do and why and what I told him was and I knew you know I know a lot of people with friedricks right so like I can kind of Judge where he is by other people and I was like look I want you to be able to do all the things that you can do now yourself now if you have a really bad Frederick&amp;#39;s day and you say I need help with this I am more than happy to help you with that but my go you know at the time there was no treatment my goal is not to make you more disabled than you are right now my goal is you know if I do these things for you that you can do yourself I&amp;#39;m essentially making you more disabled than you are and and I know as a parent that might happen in the future and I want you to be able to do whatever you can do now so um that&amp;#39;s basically been what we do obviously uh with my son he prefers my husband do like the changing you know in the bathroom stuff the shower stuff because you know like I&amp;#39;m his mother but um yeah it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s A Hard Road to go down but you should always listen to your kid if your kid&amp;#39;s like yeah please don&amp;#39;t don&amp;#39;t okay Connor is representing college students with fa so tell us a little bit about what your relationship with your parents is like now that you&amp;#39;re in college and how you balance that Independence and support yeah so um as school I&amp;#39;m able to live as independently as possible um what they usually help with is like um laundry for example like it&amp;#39;s possible to do it at school but it&amp;#39;s not feasible to stay active in what I&amp;#39;m doing there and to the simple taking care of myself which my parents can help with um so my parents my dad and my brothers have usually always been there for my transferring and driving me places because I can&amp;#39;t drive and um so they with the doctor&amp;#39;s appointments and helping me get up when I need too um so I&amp;#39;m probably close to my dad in that way cuz now my brothers both of them have moved out and now it&amp;#39;s just me and my parents but um I would say emotionally I&amp;#39;m closer to my mom um I just find her easier to talk to um yeah okay we&amp;#39;re coming to the end of our panel so the last thing we wanted to make sure our panelists could share with everyone was tips tricks life hacks whatever you want to call them about living with fa so Brandon is going to start us off with that yep so I am i v always tried to be as independent as possible so I have a lot of tips or even resources to look up and try yourself uh first of all I currently live in my parents basement and it has actually been renovated so everything is down low and more accessible I have a kitchen in a bathroom with a rolling shower in a bedroom and I have a stairlift to get up and down stairs and I also have a p that I stand and help me transfer I also currently go to physical therapy and I know a lot of other affers go to occupational therapy and speech therapy but while I&amp;#39;m at physical therapy I actually have a whole ensemble of stuff I put in I use leg braces afos and I also have knee braces to prevent my legs from hyperextending and I also practice walking with a platform Walker and I I can&amp;#39;t drive anymore but I remember back in high school I was able to drive and like driving all the time and what I did that using hand controls and I found that was a pivotal thing to help me drive but now that I can&amp;#39;t drive my family actually has a Traverse with a lift in the back so I can just roll up in there and they can strap me down and take me anywhere I want to go and even when they aren&amp;#39;t able to take me I like to call public transportation I use a nonprofit Transportation where I live and they can come pick me up and take me any where around the city I also think it is important when you are talking on the phone I like to start off conversations just saying I have F and explaining that&amp;#39;s why I have slurred speech or difficulty hearing things just to give them an understanding of why I don&amp;#39;t don&amp;#39;t know what they&amp;#39;re saying they also recommend planning to do things like what fits your schedule for example I am not a morning person at all so I I actually make sure to eat later in the day or even shower right before bed um so I make sure to do everything on my time when it works best for me and then I while I was at school I was on an IP and I know my sister is currently on a 504 and they do they help with a lot in school but I remember the most important things were that it allowed me to leave class 5 minutes late or arrive five minutes early that gave me more time to navigate through the hallways I also remember back um back well before everyone had technology I was able to use an iPad in class to help me type instead of write papers and I also think it&amp;#39;s just important to keep keep in mind in trying like to take online classes because the scheduling for due dates and stuff is more flexible so you can work on stuff when you want to get it done thanks Brandon Conor can you give the audience some advice about going to college um thinking about accommodations and accessibility yeah so I&amp;#39;ve said a couple times now that I&amp;#39;m in college but I go to school in Upper New Jersey um it is it was built for people with disabilities right after the Vietnam War so it it was developed with disabled people in mind and that&amp;#39;s always been the case um so they&amp;#39;ve always been really good with like combinations and stuff um yeah so what I would recommend if you were looking for a school I would say to keep in mind the weather different weather patterns that are unique to your location cuz like New Jersey gets kind of or at least we used to get really really cold Winters and that was like I push a manual chair to the hand RS get even colder than it is outside um so um the school I go to um most my class are in the same building so you don&amp;#39;t even have to go outside very off very often so um you just keep on the [Music] weather yeah Gretchen is going to close out the panel with her um advice for living with fa so to add on to Connor&amp;#39;s um you also have to consider if your child is using a wheelchair how far away the classes the buildings are from each other and how soon the next class starts um because some campuses are huge and um even if I had my younger son who doesn&amp;#39;t have Fredericks had a hard time making it across campus at Virginia Tech from one end to the other end for a class that would start like right after the next one so that&amp;#39;s another thing you just need to keep in mind um I wanted to ask how many people in here have children that are in the K through 12 right now with friedricks all right okay good um so I&amp;#39;m concentrating more on IEPs versus 504s um that&amp;#39;s been kind of a big topic um I this is is I I know about both this is my personal opinion um I I feel like IEPs are better than 504 plans um they both are good if they&amp;#39;re enforced um IEPs just have more protections in an IEP and it&amp;#39;s hard to get it&amp;#39;s really hard to get IEPs it took us almost a complete school year to get an IEP in place and then it didn&amp;#39;t start till the next school year so um and we and it was really hard even though we had letters from doctors we have genetic diagnosis we had falling grades um we had the support of the school psychologist it was really really hard and I sometimes feel like from talking to other parents that schools and districts don&amp;#39;t necessarily want to write IEPs um IEPs are infor they&amp;#39;re written the parents are a part of the committee the IEP committee for their child and if their child&amp;#39;s old enough so are they um the the IP sets up the one thing with an IP versus of 504 is an IEP has to be affecting your grades it&amp;#39;s got to be affecting you academically if it&amp;#39;s not affecting you academically they won&amp;#39;t give you one and you have to meet certain criteria there&amp;#39;s certain certain types of disorders that will qualify you and friedrick certainly qualifies um so an IEP has to include specific details about Services accommodations and modifications for the student there are specific goals that the IP is written with and you are getting you get reports quarterly so they have to show you how much progress they&amp;#39;ve made on each of th these goals so they&amp;#39;re evaluated and the parents get a copy and a copy is put into the child&amp;#39;s file um if you&amp;#39;re IEP means you&amp;#39;re in special ed and everybody goes no and 504s do not mean you&amp;#39;re in special ed however um the gifted and talented program is also special ed so it&amp;#39;s really not a bad thing um in an IEP let&amp;#39;s see so 504s can be written 504s can be not written and just agreed on um 504s can usually include the parents but they don&amp;#39;t have to um if the school wants to make a change to the IEP they have to let the parents know beforehand that they&amp;#39;re going to make this change and if a parent disagrees they put something called a stay put in place which means that the IP stays in place as is until this is worked out with a 504 they just have to notify the parents that they&amp;#39;re going to make a change um so as for college a lot of people people want 504s because they say it follows you to college it actually doesn&amp;#39;t follow you well it does and it doesn&amp;#39;t the 504 itself doesn&amp;#39;t follow you to college the fact that once you have a 504 it&amp;#39;s that you&amp;#39;re disabled you&amp;#39;re protected it&amp;#39;s under a different department it&amp;#39;s under the Civil I think the Civil Rights department and so you are you have Ada protections it&amp;#39;s you&amp;#39;re officially recognized that you have those um both my kids used disability Support Services in college for very different reasons and we had no problems getting these accommodations for both our kids um Sean obviously for his Fredericks and they were like well what about this do you need this what about this do you need this um for my younger son he developed celiac disease after a really bad bof flu in a sophomore year and he was constantly throwing up because when you throw up you don&amp;#39;t feel like eating broccoli and Brussels sprouts which would have stopped the throwing up you feel like eating toast and crackers and things like that and so he was constantly poisoning himself and it took a while to get it diagnosed so he was literally going all day without eating so he could attend his classes and then eating at night um but in both cases uh Disability Services was really helpful and um and Mark had no 504 no IEP no history of any of this and they still were really really helpful that the the key is that you should go visit disability support Services when you go to the colleges that you think you might want to go to and if you decide to go there you need to make them your best friends and and by the way parents um they don&amp;#39;t want to hear from you I mean you can go you know you can you can go but they want to hear from the kids because I think they figure if the kids are smart enough to go to college they&amp;#39;re smart enough to talk you know about what they need um whatever your choices on an IEP or a 504 or neither just know that you know you&amp;#39;re you&amp;#39;re the experts on your kid you probably know more about Frederick&amp;#39;s well you know more about your kid than anyone else but you know more about Frederick&amp;#39;s and the needs than anyone else you&amp;#39;re talking to practically thank you Gretchen okay so that&amp;#39;s the end of our panel um I just really want to thank all of our panelist for sharing your experiences with us I think that takes a lot of strength to be so honest and share your stories in front of an audience so thank you guys so much and thanks to everyone for listening",

one um you can find recordings on the fera YouTube channel so let&amp;#39;s continue our celebration of fa Awareness Month the month of May um with some exciting research from Junior investigators working on fa they will present their work in five minutes and they are committed to explain their research in very simple language that anybody without a science background can understand and are happy to take all the questions that you have so please type them in the Q a box as I mentioned we are recording all the sessions and you can watch them later and share them with your family and friends and at the end of the webinar um keep your browser open to vote for the best presentation the most voted presentations will will get an award um I also would like to remind you that um in may we have uh the lender some muscle Global challenge that encourages everyone to be active um so share your Fitness activity whatever it is with the hashtags that you see there um you can request free tattoos and and flex your muscles for a fair awareness we have two moderators with me today that will help with introducing the speakers and take your question Bridget and Christina um the first um just a brief summary of today&amp;#39;s talks um today we&amp;#39;ll hear how uh cell models and mouse model can be useful to understand the disease and how important they are in research um a disease like fa that affects part of the body that we cannot easily have access to like the brain needs all these tools because we cannot do certain studies in people and then we have a final talk on the other hand that is a clinical study an example of how to study the disease in people and um what I really would like you to take home today is that um we are where we are with the first treatment approved because we can use all the information that we can get from cells from animals from clinical studies in FA years like the one that you hear today and put it all together like the pieces of a puzzle to better understand fa and continue to find better and better treatments so thank you for those of you who have donated yourself some of the researchers todays are using yourselves and thank you to uh to all of you who participated both in clinical trials and in clinical studies these non-interventional studies that are equally important and with that I will turn it over to our moderator Bridges and Christina who will introduce themselves and the speakers hi there my name is Bridget danan I was diagnosed with the fa at the age of 10 and I am a teacher in South Carolina happy to be here thank you for having me our first Speaker today is Priyanka Mishra from the University of California at San Diego and Mishra is studying I mean I&amp;#39;m sorry that is studying the brain immune system and Fa using stem cells so whenever you&amp;#39;re ready Priyanka good evening to everyone so uh um I&amp;#39;m a postdoc uh in Dr Stephanie Cherokee lab so here I&amp;#39;m going to present today uh the past work and the current work we are doing so we um as uh we developed previously we did the stem cell transplantation so in that we showed that the single infusion of wildlife hematopoetic stem cells to the fa mice model rescue uh the Fifi phenotype and also we noticed that these hematopetical stem cells are trans are crossed the bloodborne barrier go to the brain and differentiate it into the micro Clearlake cells and these microglia cells are transferring fretaxine protein which is deficient in fedic Ataxia to the neuronal cells so they are making them happy the neurons so in addition to that in continuation of that we did the second study uh which is um which developed autologous uh stem cells transplantation approach um more about this study uh my colleague Dr uh shiv kumaran is going to discuss on 25th May but in the current study we are trying to uh study the mole mechanism behind that how these microbial cells are interacting with neurons and what is the impact of fatigue scene deficiency on these neuron and microbial cells and in addition to this to prove the uh the origin therapy approach we&amp;#39;re trying to see that when we are editing these cells in the culture uh they are reversing the phenotype or not so uh to study this we are using a human based model system um we are we we are using the ipsc induced periodic patent stem cells these stem cells are generated from the from the patient fibroblasts cells and differentiated into the desired cell type in the lab so here our interest is in the neuron and microglia cells so we are differentiating these uh ipscs into the neuron and microglia cells but in addition to this we are also making a organoid which is called a mini brain uh so because in our brain a different kind of cells are not only the neuron and my cochlea other cell type is also present so we are trying to understand the impact of adult cell type on to the neuron and microglia so that&amp;#39;s why we we differentiated those cells into the organoid also so when we are start we had successfully this is the representative image how the the neurons look like in the plate and this this is a mini brain organoid and look like in the plate in the lab so when we start differentiating these neurons we notice some very striking phenotype uh in the patient cell line you can see these like lot of dots and these are indicated the cell death but interestingly when we do the gene editing these phenotype I&amp;#39;ll get reverse we see very good and healthy neuron in the gene edit itself line as compared to the patient line so to um and the same phenotype we notice in the 3D organoid also uh there are a lot of cell death in the in the neuron which is from patient line as compared to the gene edited line so um to confirm this we did some cell death assay and we found that the the cell death is more in the patient line as compared to the to the gene edited line so as we know that the phytic seam is a mitochondrial protein so we are also interested to know about the mitochondria in that uh patient line and our Gene edited corrected line so um when we use a one die which uh which is stain for the toxic substance which is generated by the damage of the micro mitochondria so when the mitochondria is damaged there is a lot of red uh stain we can see uh in the in the in the slide so interestingly uh in the patient line you can see a very uh red dotted stuff we founded but the gene editing editing reverse that phenotype and we are not seeing any damage micro mitochondria there but uh to again verify this we want to see the structure of the mitochondria so we go to the electron microscopy that high resolution and we can see the organs organelles exactly what they all look like so uh you this is a healthy controls uh mitochondria you can see that structure is very beautiful and we can see all the structure intact in the uh in the control line but when we move to the fat the patient line the mitochondria is look very disease and we can&amp;#39;t see the structure even of the mitochondria and in gene edited we can see that this structure is reverse and we see the mitochondrial structure very clearly so this is again proved that the gene editing improve the the phenotype and mitochondrial function so this is all about neurons but we are also interested in the microglia so with the help of Dr Nicole coffel uh we differentiated these ipscs into the microglia and we noticed that the mitochondria from the patient are very uh omnivorient because uh you can&amp;#39;t see their branching and they all look very activated in compared to the gene addicted mitochondria they are more branch and more healthy look like and the quantification also revealed that the mitochondria the the microglia which is uh differentiated from the frd patient is not healthy as compared to the gene additive so here we uh we are we have a good platform now we can share that the gene editing reverse the phenotype and improve the mitochondrial function and this is also a proof of concept of our first and second study but in continuation of that we are going to more study on mechanism how these microglia and the neuron are interacting and uh like uh how the microblia is transferring fetaxine to the neuron thank you that was wonderful thank you so much and thank you for trying to explain it so we can all understand it um before I turn this over I have a question do you collaborate with anyone in study in the microbial I know that other kids studied it as I said that we are collaborative with Dr koffel uh she&amp;#39;s also in UCSD and um in with the help of Dr kofal we are studying the microgram great Christine I want to take some audience questions yes does anyone have any questions you can simply type it in the Q a section I&amp;#39;ll start with one um what um Bianca you&amp;#39;ll explain a little bit what the microglia does uh sorry can I can you repeat the question what does what what is the microbial okay okay yeah so um microglia is a kind of defense system uh in the in the brain so in the whole body uh macrophages is playing that role if something is come from the outside they they are uh creating a barrier and they are trying to engulf those uh those particles or those substance which is look toxic to the to the cells uh so same in the brain the microglia is doing the defense system if something look toxic or not required for the brain they try to engulf or try to digest them so in that case they make the environment healthy I hope I explained better for yes thank you there&amp;#39;s a question are there any indications that your stem cell neurons are sensory uh no these are not the sensory neurons we are working on corticals uh neurons not the sensory neuron we are particularly giving the media and growth factor which convert the ipsc into the cortical neurons another question um someone says I understand there&amp;#39;s a big difference between fa cells and edited cells which looks great how important is the brain immunity part as I said the microglia is working as a defense system so they are when the microglia is not healthy and not trying to like not doing their job properly so all the immune system like all the inflammatory other like other all the markers are get up and they create a very toxic environment inside the brain so that&amp;#39;s why microglia is is a very important for the immune system so for example if you would to would um mix the healthy microgria microglia with the fa neurons do you think the fa Nails would get better yes because um the our first study showed that the hematocratic stem cells when transplanted they go to they differentiated to the microglia it means those are healthy microglia and they go to the brain and they are reversing the phenotype of the fa so that&amp;#39;s why um we we did we create the mini brain organized model so now we are planning to do some this kind of experiment to give them the healthy microglia and try to see how they are reacting but but as I said in the the first study we already showed that if we provide the healthy microblia somehow they are reversing the phenotype can you tell me what type of Gene editing you are talking about with your research so here we are using a crispr cas9 so as we know that there is an expansion of GAA so we try to remove that here expansion and try to correct those cells so that react normal then all right I think Christina thank you Priyanka thank you Christina can introduce the second speaker and my name is Christina and I am a patient of fa so I was diagnosed at 21 I&amp;#39;m now 32. um I live right outside Philadelphia with my husband and my dog and um I work full-time in the hospitality industry so our next speaker is from swinburne University of Technology and she&amp;#39;s going to be discussing a property compound and its potential use for fa hello everyone hello my name is Wen young I&amp;#39;m a PhD student at slumber University of Technology and my research topic is about abruptly compound and its potential use for free taxi my supervisors are Dr fitzcrat and the professor Bruce Thompson and I also would like to acknowledge the contribution of my research Cooperators from UT Southwestern Medical Center and inawara health and medical research institute in this world and thank you Vara from TNT to share our research as we all know if a the Hallmark of essay is to reduce the contacting levels caused by the genetic abnormality here and the regulated by material processes here and reduce the level of the taxing affects any cell type such rely on for taxing for meter counter functioning iron transportation and cell metabolism the museum cup has been affected in uncensory neurons as for taxing is highly concerned in this cell type and all affected cells are suffering from oxidative stress and the inflammation ultimately cell will be better without treatment currently there is only one approved therapy for fa that only targets the oxidative strengths pathway and therefore there is still a need to find other alternative compounds that may be Target other alternative Pathways in the pathogenesis of fa one such compound wisdom potential to do that is the Brooklyn compounds of orophil abbreviated as SF it is isolated from cruciferous pounds with the multiple permanent Stones being bodily which is a small molecular can penetrate the cell membranes and across the blood and barrier this means SF can Target all those disease processes applying inside definitely patient cells regardless of the cell type including the neurons confidential nervous system and in other chronic disease models with ISF can successfully reverse constitute these positives and in a very few studies of fa ith such as FAS in cells and the neurons from the rodents we find sfk increase the freaking mRNA levels with 24 hours treatment however those models are not physiologically relevant and do not carrying the full extent of the genetic abnormality so one unique feature about our research is we&amp;#39;re using a normal fa patient inputes the Brooklyn stem cell ipsc derived Sensory neurons developed by our research corporations and these models will carry the full extent of the genetic abnormality the air repeats from the fa patients and show the low level of perfectexin we differentiate those psychiences and the culture them into subsequent Sensory neurons and with these three steps three stages down how to outcome and the reason we use this particle is because it&amp;#39;s allowing us to expanding the cell numbers for large-scale Downstream applications and we treat the sensory neurons with SF and our polymerase that institutional as it can improve the cell liability of the patient ipsc directors and Generals by up June 40 percent when compared to the untreated and we also found SF is able to directly oxidative stress and the reduce inflammation and then reverse the two processes that regulator for taxing Mia levels and to sum up we found the Broadway compound SF BBM potential therapeutic option for s4fa thank you thank you that was a very informative and then I have a question so are there other neurodegenerate neural degenerative diseases that have been targeted with this approach and how does that relate to fa um you may have as I&amp;#39;ve been tested in other neurological disease yeah I think I read a paper about Alzheimer&amp;#39;s disease some people trying to use SF for treating Alzheimer and they also find SF can Target the epigenetic genetic pathway or the disease so I think um but for for my research we only focus on fa so I don&amp;#39;t know too much about other disease so maybe one um clarification no explanation you could give is we always talk about this oxidative stress what is oxidative extracts in the cell oxidative stress in the cell for us we mainly talk about the the ability of the sounds to cope with the oxidative stress because no matter the patient means disease or without disease everybody were suffering from some extent of the alternative stress because we we are human and for the fa patients they are most have less ability to cope with some active stress because they have a reduced level of taxing and therefore they have lower level of alive too I don&amp;#39;t know if everyone can understand their life to signal in past week so it&amp;#39;s a pathway that can help us to produce more Phase 2 results enzyme can help to cope with the oxidative stress so for our research we examine the level of those three markers when we see the increase of fixed rate of enzyme and coldly dreams we we assume people have increased capability of of with the oxidative stress we learned in the res virtual study that we need to take way more than than is in a glass of wine to make a difference does this benefit require us to just eat more broccoli or would it just or would also need us to take a pill with lots of SF to get the benefit so for my understanding because the concentration of SF have not been determined yet and the typical can take a there are supplement of SF compound available in the market but we should wait until it&amp;#39;s become clinical approval and then to make the approach and also the concentration of SF from broccoli is not enough for people when we take daily consumable for that so I think if we just speak properly it&amp;#39;s not enough so you were talking about Nrf2 and you know we just had the first approved treatment in essay that targets Nrf2 which is all lab so do you know if this compound has a similar effect that Omar does yeah I think and they also because SF is also a well well-known and Life to inducer and shows empty inflammatory effect and the oxygen effect these two are similar to omf our interest is SF might be also Target like multiple pathway so in in this point maybe it&amp;#39;s more promising but I&amp;#39;m not quite sure until I have the results we we are working on this at the moment do you plan to test this together with drugs that Target other Pathways of oxidative stress like a Max illness yes we do we we have the plan to do that and also we are working on it okay thank you Danielle thank you Bridget yeah ready for our third presenter is Elizabeth Mercado Ayan she is from the University of Pennsylvania and studying the brain of an fa Mouse model can you guys see it just fine okay well hi everyone my name is Elizabeth mercadarian I&amp;#39;m a PhD student at the University of Pennsylvania in Dr David Lynch&amp;#39;s lab who many of you might know and um happy to share my work on studying the brain and Fa mice models um so our brains are the organ in our body the basically process all the information from how we behave how we feel how we move um and there are different regions in the brain as you can see here in different colors folks um and they all interact with each other but each region has a specific task for example here in green um in the temporal lobe we have memory processing in the occipital lobe we have um Vision processing but here I am get a focus on the cerebellum which is responsible for um processing all the information that is going to affect any find more moment and balance and coordination which we know [Applause] um are greatly affected in FA patients and we also know that in fa patients um what causes fa is a mutation that leads to the reduced expression of first toxin so basically the cerebellum manipa patients it&amp;#39;s saying I don&amp;#39;t have enough protection what is happening to me and basically that is my research question um and I&amp;#39;m trying to um answer it by utilizing to to mice models that each of them has a different uh genetic makeup but they both present um produce expression of her Toxin and also um a toxic Behavior so the first thing that I look at is a specific cell type copper Genji cells that are very important in the cerebellum and um some lab members looked at uh purkinje cell activity and basically we see them um a little uh slower um they have lower activity compared to cultural healthy mice um the next thing that I looked at was uh um cell components and uh the first thing that I see is that this receptor that is needed for green g cells to communicate with each other and with other cells is um decrease and I wanted to depict this by this blue sphere so best of these um very important receptors and also I see um uh less expression no first Daxton and going on with the fratoxin next I wanted to see where um where is the highest protective expression um because in the cerebellum there&amp;#39;s also many other types of cells and for this I utilize um healthy human monkey and mice cerebellum slides and I stained them here on green um eye stain protection with this color green and basically I see that protection is highly expressed or highly found um in purkinje cells which are these zoomed in boxes and in the human monkey and mice and um there seems to be a lower um in the purkinje cell um fa mice model uh the next thing I did was to do a freaking G cell count in each of these mice um and in one of them I see that there&amp;#39;s some purkinje cell decrease and in the other mice I don&amp;#39;t see any decrease at all so from these um results basically I could say that so we know that purkinje cells are very important in the cerebellum we know that they contain um high amount of protection compared to other cells in the cerebellum and we see that their activity um cell components are affected in that phase so because of protection deficiency so I could conclude that the cerebellum and purkinje cells are potential therapeutic targets and for the treatment of fa that&amp;#39;s it wow that was awesome thank you for sharing that how long have you been studying this um I&amp;#39;ve been in other projects in Dave&amp;#39;s lab but um this so in Dave&amp;#39;s lab for five years now um and in this project that specifically um like a year and so are there any therapies do you think would Target the cerebellum and the pretentious cells or just anything that would increase for tax them might help um I would say the anything that increases first toxin um because obviously every region in the cerebellum in the brain does not act um alone there&amp;#39;s communication um for example in the spinal cord uh in the central nervous system that directly connects to um this cerebellum but for this um a bigger implication I would say like gene therapy that directly targets these um burkinje cells and um yeah in this circle yeah definitely Christina do we have any audience questions not yet but if anyone has any questions please ask and then I can um ask Elizabeth that was very well explained yeah and I I&amp;#39;d like to say that um this is obviously you know in some way the news right because you find that these cells they are you know they have this you say that a little bit lower activity they don&amp;#39;t respond as well but they&amp;#39;re still there right so this is we always talk about how low for taxing damages the cells and induces eventually sell that but this is this kind of damage is potentially reversible so this is why you know you&amp;#39;re saying this is a interpreted Target or another thing because you know the cells yes they are dysfunctional but they are still there and maybe we can recover the function that they are responsible so this is you know in some ways right yeah exactly um it is easier to repair something that replaced it so exactly yeah that&amp;#39;s wonderful and um I I had questions about a question about um you&amp;#39;re saying that um you&amp;#39;re studying this this rebellum it with two different Mouse models um do you want to tell us a little bit what they are and why are you using two different models what can you learn from one that you can&amp;#39;t learn from the other well the first thing um comes directly from Dave and we know that mice are not human and um but One MA there&amp;#39;s no perfect mice model of fa what one one of them has the other one is missing and so on but um so here I want to see the most um similarities between both of them because what they have in common is that they express less products um and in this case one of the mice is a acute mice knockdown meaning that um we basically turn on a switch that says like um trash all the protects it and the other one the other Mouse um is like born with already less protected and yeah so one is chronic and one is acute a few questions came in so the first one how do you explain that one Mouse model has less circum J cells and then not the other ones did they both present neurologic deficits so they um yes they do both um but the one the one that I see is some Perkins you sell that this one is the acute or really fast for tax in knockdown and um yeah uh I would say one of the main differences is the the speed at which the first taxing gets reduced so in in the mice that that I see um some percentages of that is the one that we basically switch um turn on the switch to knock down for toxin so um it&amp;#39;s very um robust and very um how do I say um it occurs very fast so basically suddenly you&amp;#39;ll be cells I would say that they are missing their energy their whatever component they need so yeah I would say because of the speed that for Jackson gets knocked down and also these the mice that I see less purkinje cells have a a penile type or a toxic behavior um earlier than the other mice the drg sensor neurons are affected in FA what effect does damage do drgs have on cell so celebrate uh decreased sorry decreased function um decrease function in drgs or what sorry yeah so that they&amp;#39;re asking if you know in the degeneration that you see in the sensory neural and ERG has an effect eventually on on decreasing cerebellum function if the connection between the spinal cord and for example then the cerebellum are factor which they are in methane and that can have an effect on the cerebellum um yes is especially um in the Dentin nucleus of the cerebellum it it connects there&amp;#39;s very complicated Pathways but they do uh connect with they end up connecting with the RGS so it&amp;#39;s all um a chain of events here and um we could say we don&amp;#39;t know really where um I do know there&amp;#39;s a developmental component component in that affects the RGS so we don&amp;#39;t know if it begins and drgs and then it goes to a cerebellum or vice versa I don&amp;#39;t know exactly and then we never heard our perfume J cells before has any therapy even in other conditions been shown to affect them um well you just gave me an idea of something to look into but I&amp;#39;m pretty sure especially for the spinal cerebellar taxis um um because Perkins cells are the main cell type affected in Springfield or Ataxia so I should definitely look into that thank you so I think that&amp;#39;s all the questions that we have so we&amp;#39;ll go into our last speaker um Camilla Whitesell she&amp;#39;s with the Children&amp;#39;s Hospital of Philadelphia and she is studying how is diabetes in children with a fa different from adults okay so hello my name is Camilla Weitzel and I&amp;#39;m an undergraduate student at the University of Pennsylvania working in the McCormick lab today I will be discussing glucose and Insulin metabolism in children and adults with friedrich&amp;#39;s ataxia so the McCormick lab here at chop is an endocrine group interested in diabetes that often goes along with fa we know diabetes and folks without friedrich&amp;#39;s Ataxia can affect the heart and the nervous system so we are interested in identifying diabetes risk and progression and Friedrich Ataxia because of these organ effects so Dr tamaroff the senior author of this talk has been supported by Farah to study diabetes in FA in earlier studies we found nine percent of patients with friedrich&amp;#39;s Ataxia have diabetes prior studies also found that prior to diabetes patients have glucose and Insulin metabolism abnormalities we believe that if we identify these early glucose and Insulin changes we may be able to improve heart health while there has been some research looking at adult glucose and insulin levels and risk of diabetes there currently are not many studies evaluating glucose levels in children with redrix Ataxia we decided to take advantage of an ongoing clinical trial here at chop to understand glucose and Insulin metabolism across the lifespan utilizing Baseline pre-treatment oral glucose tolerance test data so we have hypothesized that like adults children with redrix Ataxia will have abnormalities that suggest a future risk of diabetes our participants poll that we&amp;#39;re talking about today consists of 12 children and 15 adults about evenly split female to male the Pediatric participants are mostly normal weight in the adult distribution approximately aligns with what is seen in the U.S population for the oral glucose tolerance tests the participants will drink the glucose drink and at nine various time points their glucose insulin and a few other hormone levels are taken within this data we have more specifically looked at fasting glucose which is the patient&amp;#39;s glucose level prior to drinking eating and we also look at glucose levels at both the one and two hour marks additionally we wanted to evaluate Homa IR which is a measure of fasting insulin resistance a Homa IR value above 2 is consistent with insulin resistance when evaluating adults we identified participants with impaired fasting glucose which is a glucose value at or greater than 100 prior to eating and drinking we also identify participants with impaired glucose tolerance a measure of glucose that is 140 or greater at the two hour mark and these values are consistent with pre-diabetes we found that approximately half of the adult participants were considered to have elevated post-neal glucose levels which is a measurement at or above 155 at the one hour mark while this is not a diagnostic for pre-diabetes it has been shown in other populations with increased risk additionally some of the adult participants appear to have an inadequate insulin response at high glucose levels but when looking at our pediatric participants we see mostly normal glucose levels but a slower return to Baseline than what is seen in the adults the high median Homa IR is indicative of fasting insulin resistance amongst the children some of the Pediatric participants experience post-meal insulin resistance and we have seen substantial between individual variability as indicated by the large error bars on the Pediatric insulin graph so going forward we would like to continue evaluating additional participants and conduct additional metabolic studies and we&amp;#39;re going to analyze participant glucose and Insulin data along with body composition data futural stage information and other parameters to look for correlations between insulin resistance and Friedrich ataxia as previously mentioned this data is from a baseline study visits for a current clinical trial at the Children&amp;#39;s Hospital of Philadelphia this trial is evaluating exercise and a supplement in FA and with this study we will be able to identify the effects of exercise in this supplement on glucose and Insulin metabolism so if you&amp;#39;re interested in learning more about this trial please email annadettio whose information is on the slide and thank you for everyone for listening today and thank you to everyone at Farah this opportunity and I welcome any questions thank you so does this study plan on being at other sites besides chop foreign I know uh not like we are still currently enrolling but I think um almost positive all the appointments have been done at chop and I know Dr tamrock also works at Vanderbilt um yeah but it&amp;#39;s single just that top I believe and you said that this study was is done in conjunction with the exercise and maybe study right so if not in Broly&amp;#39;s separately from that study from the participant of the um yeah the it&amp;#39;s the clinical trial um with uh Dr McCormick that um is in its year four of a five-year NIH award um currently enrolling what type of diabetes is seen an fa is it type one type two or something in between and then do you know if glucose metabolism is affected by the progression yeah so um I&amp;#39;m an undergrad and I&amp;#39;m currently still saying this but I know that um it seems that like there is a something in between um going on with some of the data um and then in regards to uh progression this is something like we&amp;#39;re still currently evaluating to see like looking for correlations in between and can you um maybe explain what what some of these parameters are for example what is glucose tolerance that you&amp;#39;re measuring what does that mean uh yeah so um some of the uh things that are like mentioned on the slide like the impaired fasting glucose and impaired glucose tolerance are parameters used to diagnose diabetes and so it&amp;#39;s seen when you like when they take the uh have the oral glucose tolerance test these um values for different things so the impaired uh glucose tolerance and the impaired fasting um glucose the fasting glucose parameter is a value of 100 or greater and then the impaired glucose tolerance would be 140 or greater and those are what are like parameters that are used to diagnose diabetes do we do we have any ideas of why um if they affects the also you know the increase you know if there&amp;#39;s any dysfunctions in the cells of the pancreas um I know that like we&amp;#39;re still evaluating maybe why we believe that there are certain things but slightly like multifactorial um like effects that uh between like for toxin deficiency there are so many things still being evaluated and studied kind of like we heard today um so it&amp;#39;s plausible that there&amp;#39;s a role there that like affects insulin resistance in patients actually I don&amp;#39;t see any more questions right Christina that&amp;#39;s all okay all right then um thank you thank you to all the speakers thank you for your effort in explaining to us your research and sharing with us um the results of your research and thank you Bridges and Christina for moderating um thank you for having me yes and and asking them questions and participating um just a reminder that the next session is May 18th and we&amp;#39;re going back to the noon time 12 p.m Eastern um and next time we will hear about more therapeutic approaches um Don&amp;#39;t Close Your browser right away at the end vote for your favorite presentation

    "transcript": "what&amp;#39;s up and welcome to FF Friday&amp;#39;s where on Friday we talk about Friedreich&amp;#39;s ataxia today we&amp;#39;re gonna talk about the dentist let&amp;#39;s get into it [Music] welcome to episode 7 thank you for watching thank you for those who&amp;#39;ve been watching commenting messaging me make sure you subscribe on YouTube Instagram Facebook you can see all the episodes but this week I want to talk about the dentist that&amp;#39;s right the dentist why I recently went to with the dentist and I hate going there it hurt like they scrape and scratch your teeth with those metal things and it&amp;#39;s extremely uncomfortable for me this time I wondered then am I going to pass out i sat there with my eyes closed just hoping man don&amp;#39;t let me pass out lord it was super uncomfortable but here&amp;#39;s the thing is I knew it would be that way and I chose to go there why did I choose to go there I went there because I knew it would be good for me it is good for me and it&amp;#39;s important to go there so as I was leaving I was thinking about it and the way this ties in to life and especially life with Friedreich&amp;#39;s ataxia is this before I was diagnosed with the SI I started soon no lace I had some difficulty doing certain things that required a lot of balance so there were certain exercises [Music] that I would be shaky or I would be off balance and because I didn&amp;#39;t want to embarrass myself I just didn&amp;#39;t do them so I would just avoid things that were difficult but when I became diagnosed with FA and I went in to see the physical therapist a it was very humbling because I was given a lot of exercises that specifically dealt with your balance and your coordination and I was really bad at him it was super humbling and yeah but as I kept going and I kept practicing and I kept working on these things I actually showed like mass improvement even though I do have FA but it was by doing the uncomfortable things that I had avoided for so long by actually doing them I greatly increased and became better and so to the people with FA I want to say you know what there are certain things that are more difficult I definitely don&amp;#39;t want to go do things that are unsafe for you but I want to encourage you wherever you&amp;#39;re at in the journey to find a way to push yourself physically and do everything you can do maybe you can&amp;#39;t run but you can walk so go for a walk every day maybe you can lift weights but you could do push-ups or push-ups on your knees find something that&amp;#39;s safe and challenging for you physically and make sure you go and do that every day to the people with and without FA I want to speak to the greater metaphor of life there are things that you know you should do that are difficult for you to do maybe there is a relationship that you need to reconcile maybe you need to go back to school and you need to get that degree maybe you know you should go to the gym or you should go see a therapist or you should start eating healthy or you need to start going to church or whatever it is there are some things that you know you should do that you know you need to do but you don&amp;#39;t want to do them because they it&amp;#39;s painful is uncomfortable but I want to encourage you that pain that discomfort is worth it because ultimately it will be good for you it will be better for you in the long run just like going to the dentist and maybe for some you that&amp;#39;s it you need to go to the dentist and you&amp;#39;ve been avoiding it so thank you for tuning in that&amp;#39;s FA Friday&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s do boy 10:20 thank you [Music]",

    "transcript": "hello and welcome to wytv7.org i&amp;#39;m your host by repetitive family matters family matters airs every thursday nine o&amp;#39;clock pm eastern standard time family matters is a podcast where we interview people who are going through real life situations in real time my hope is every week that you tune into family matters that you gain some insight and some information that will either charge you to do something different in your own life or maybe help out somebody else help out somebody else today i&amp;#39;m excited to have someone i&amp;#39;ve known for oh my goodness uh 30 plus years 40 plus years baby we&amp;#39;ve known each other through facebook she&amp;#39;s someone i went to high school with for a hot second and then she went someplace else and i stayed the course at that high school um but we follow each other on facebook and i&amp;#39;ve kind of watched the maturation of her being a parent and raising uh two children and one of her children is a special needs child her name is elisa all right welcome to the show thank you okay so elisa as i just said you have two children um one child&amp;#39;s name is roman and yeah i use the term special needs like i said correct me if i&amp;#39;m not using the correct language but what i found on february 28th as i&amp;#39;m perusing on facebook you said it was rare disease day and you kind of mentioned about what that was like for you and how and correct me if i&amp;#39;m wrong a lot of folks in society may understand uh what that day is and what that entails to be a parent talk to us about that day and why it&amp;#39;s an important or special day for you well rares rare disease days just raises awareness once a year towards those diseases that you don&amp;#39;t really hear about in the mainstream a rare disease is categorized as an orphan disease which means it&amp;#39;s usually um there you know my son is one in fifty thousand that has his disorder um and when you have an orphan disease there&amp;#39;s no funding from the government to find cures for these diseases so that&amp;#39;s why it&amp;#39;s kind of considered an orphan disease because it&amp;#39;s just because it&amp;#39;s so rare it&amp;#39;s very hard to get funding to find a cure so as parents i know for myself i used to always have fundraisers for my son just to you know raise the money to go towards research but it&amp;#39;s just it just raises awareness you know for those diseases that aren&amp;#39;t as common or as as you know well-known i guess okay okay okay appreciate that you&amp;#39;re educating us right out the back so you have two boys now i know roman is one child&amp;#39;s name what&amp;#39;s your other son&amp;#39;s name julian okay now is roman the oldest or is julian the oldest roman is the oldest rowan will be 23 in may um but with that said julian always felt he was the older brother because he had a lot of responsibility having an older disabled brother so it&amp;#39;s kind of funny they even kind of kind of switch roles themselves you know julian kind of says he&amp;#39;s roman&amp;#39;s big brother a lot okay okay which which takes me to so when we find out as parents we find out we&amp;#39;re pregnant with the child all this sort of level of excitement comes in it would be a new mom etc etc etc so talk about when maybe you got the information from the pediatrician saying hey you&amp;#39;re still going to be a mother but um and that but maybe what you talked about the um the disorder or or what roman was going to be going through um in this world when you got that information what did it do to you as far as your mentor in regards to preparing you to be a new mother well i had roman back in 1999 back then they didn&amp;#39;t really offer the genetic testing it was just for um it was just for the um you know like the the mental retardation i think those that was like the main focus when you&amp;#39;re pregnant so my my pregnancy was very healthy my son came out incredibly healthy um it was a progressive disease so he started to get incredibly clumsy he was in sports he was in karate he was very active about second third grade he just started to get really clumsy and his teacher brought it to our attention and i&amp;#39;m super clumsy so i thought oh he just takes after me and after about two years of being pro poked and prodded and blood tests and going to every pediatrician we could um they then gave us the diagnosis of friedrich&amp;#39;s ataxia and it was incredibly swift incredibly progressive within three years he was using a walker and then another three years he was wheelchair-bound so um there was really no warning it was just we were just that was the hand we worked out yeah okay okay now what age what age was he when you mentioned you said you said well he was clumsy because i was a clumsy parent i thought maybe that&amp;#39;s just what he was but what age was it when they when you begin to see a really transformation his inability to maybe do some things um that other kids kids will be able to do easy um well like i said middle well elementary right around when we started to get him um tested i would say about third grade what is third grade gosh you&amp;#39;re making me go way back i know and i have one was that seven seven well maybe a little bit older than that maybe nine nine or ten um so once we got the diagnosis though it was just i mean it was very quick and even his doctor said that the form of friedrichs that he has it took his mobility quicker than most um but with with the disorder my son has it attacks all the muscles in the body the heart is a muscle so normally these kids die very young of heart attacks usually before the age of 25. my son&amp;#39;s friedrichs is so different it took his mobility quicker than most but his heart is perfect so you know he&amp;#39;s you know every kind of child has a different experience if you will um so yeah like i said he just immediately after the diagnosis it just kind of went downhill from there okay well take take us take us through it from roman&amp;#39;s perspective how he was feeling i was like mom what&amp;#39;s going on because we each party felt something totally different take us take us for listening how he how he was dealing with this um not well i mean even to this day he will not let anyone give him a shot because he felt like a pin cushion for two years and he expressed that i&amp;#39;m tired of going to the doctor i&amp;#39;m tired of being poked i feel like no i&amp;#39;m a pin cushion i&amp;#39;m tired of getting shots because we had to go through a lot of um tests just to see just to kind of narrow it down to see what it was and they when they like the last test they took they they were saying we think this is friedrichs we really hope it&amp;#39;s not but that&amp;#39;s what we&amp;#39;re leaning towards and then that&amp;#39;s when we got the diagnosis that that&amp;#39;s in fact what it was so roman i don&amp;#39;t i mean he was still so young he wasn&amp;#39;t quite sure what was going on um and my son he&amp;#39;s he&amp;#39;s quite stubborn he doesn&amp;#39;t express himself very much you know so um we i always just try to stay very positive with him but i i of course now as he&amp;#39;s gotten older he&amp;#39;s able to look at things on the internet and see what his disease is and read about things but i try to keep that from him for a while because it&amp;#39;s pretty higher if that makes sense yeah how did the school now did you have to take him out of school did you homeschool him did the school provide any sort of resources and service for him when he went back to school i&amp;#39;m going to tell you byron that&amp;#39;s my only regret with my son i wish i would have homeschooled him it was incredibly traumatizing for my son and as a mom i didn&amp;#39;t know you know he didn&amp;#39;t ever want to get out of bed and go to school i mean he would lay there like stiff as a board like i&amp;#39;m not going to school well then they started to send me letters like we&amp;#39;re going to get you with rebecca bill if you don&amp;#39;t send your son to school you&amp;#39;re you know you know how they do now if you don&amp;#39;t send your kids you can get in big trouble that really scared me because i&amp;#39;m like okay here i have a child that hates school he cries but then i have these people saying we&amp;#39;re gonna jail you if you don&amp;#39;t send your son to school so i i did end up going to um like the prince i don&amp;#39;t even remember the process but i did get him on a 504 and a 504 plan for kids you know it just kind of states he&amp;#39;s got no mental disabilities just physical but because of these disabilities there&amp;#39;s going to be days he can&amp;#39;t get to school because with this disorder he gets so tired i mean it just drains all his energy so thank god i finally got that in place because then they kind of left me alone about it but he still had to go to school and that was a huge struggle that was a fight every day and if i could go back and do it over again i would not send him to school okay i would i would have done it yeah i would have just kept them at home with me and homeschooled him at home okay now this day and age your kids your kids are much older mines are still in elementary so now going to school you got to sign these anti-bullying waivers and et cetera et cetera et cetera now for him when he was in elementary did did he experience any bullying or you were just saying byron i would have kept roman at home just to homeschool him for the process not necessarily him being bullied at school did he did he experience that while he was going through school or not really not so much elementary his father remarried when we split up and he married my son&amp;#39;s teacher so he had a really good support system at school i don&amp;#39;t think she would have allowed it and i used to go meet him for lunch a lot i made my presents very known in elementary i was very involved so the kids were really really cool to roam um but middle school was tough um i caught wind of a kid stealing his lunch he said mom this kid steals my lunch every day well mom went to school and sat out at lunch and the principal was like ma&amp;#39;am i&amp;#39;ll take care of it but he didn&amp;#39;t steal his lunch anymore after that so um right i think the hardest part for him was kids just avoided him he was in a wheelchair he was different so kids just left him alone so he had a very lonely existence at school okay okay which would y&amp;#39;all think about what we&amp;#39;re doing like i i wanted you to come on to talk about talk about rare disease today day talk about roman talk about um kind of what you went through but you&amp;#39;re right a lot of people would just say i&amp;#39;m if i my silence means acceptance but really my silence means i don&amp;#39;t know really what to say or how to interact like you said his heart was working if his mind is clear have a conversation how you doing and that&amp;#39;s the same thing i think for me at times as well i have to be honest you struggle because you don&amp;#39;t know what to say and sometimes you can just say hey elisa how you doing how how&amp;#39;s your boys doing just have a conversation but i think you doing this so let me give you your flowers now let&amp;#39;s say i appreciate you doing this and coming on because i do believe someone&amp;#39;s going to tune in and say you know what if i if i&amp;#39;m hearing anything from the mom it&amp;#39;s just like you know treat treat people as human beings just have a conversation um so i appreciate i appreciate for that let me ask you a question because you i was going to ask you you said dad remarried so how did he handle this parenting with you in regards to roman and his needs like was he like i&amp;#39;m out i&amp;#39;m mad at you it was kind of opposite uh when we split we were going through the process of getting roman tested um because like i said it was about third grade and we split on very very good terms but then he started to date my son&amp;#39;s teacher and then it was like um i think she stepped in thinking she could take over and they tried that they tried very hard to kind of get me out of the picture um but i&amp;#39;m very strong-willed so that wasn&amp;#39;t going to happen he&amp;#39;s easy i have to say he was a good father to my kids he was a good father just when it came to co-parenting he refused so that was difficult um you know everything had to be emailed through email his wife insisted we we only email each other um we were in court a lot um because he didn&amp;#39;t feel like me being a single woman would was i wasn&amp;#39;t good enough to raise our child um so that was that was kind of tragic in itself it would have been a lot easier to raise a kid that had some special needs it would have been easier to raise them together but it is what it is you know yeah yeah now did roman did he sense any of that pushback or any of the disconnect between mom and dad oh yes oh it that&amp;#39;s a whole nother podcast but um dad was real good at influencing my son&amp;#39;s mind it was it&amp;#39;s kind of sad he but you know now that my son is older like he just called me a few minutes before we came on and he needs to come over and take a shower mom i need you to come you know give me a shower today so he&amp;#39;s coming back to mom that makes me grateful okay okay well let&amp;#39;s do this let&amp;#39;s go to commercial break when i come back i want to ask you additional questions but i also want to ask you how you made it through what were sort of some of the things you or was it your faith or did you ever question god like why me so we come back i want to get into more questions and give you an opportunity to also let people know what they can do as far as getting in contact with you if there&amp;#39;s some questions they may have in raising a child with special needs as well will we go on a commercial break and we&amp;#39;ll be right back okay eighty percent of women will develop a pelvic health condition at some point in their lives there is relief there is hope the pelvic floor store your resource for personal health hello and welcome back to family matters i am here with elisa and we are talking today in regards to her son roman and elisa before we went to break you told us the name of the rare disease so again can you just tell the listing audience um the name of the disease and how it impacts the body okay so he has what&amp;#39;s called friedrichs ataxia they just a german doctor discovered it back in the 1800s so fast forward now we&amp;#39;re still at 2022 um it is a very progressive disease it takes it&amp;#39;s neurological and it takes over the muscles it took over his ability to walk very quickly um it affects the spinal cord it thins the spinal cord it can cause diabetes blindness it does attack the tongue so his speech is it&amp;#39;s difficult to understand my son sometimes um and unfortunately attacks the heart hearts a muscle so a lot of these kids don&amp;#39;t have a very long life under the age of 25 is usually you know when they start to get a heart disease but but you would tell us offline his heart is healthy his heart isn&amp;#39;t healthy yeah thank god we praise god for that yes yes yes 1800 to 2022 so you&amp;#39;re trying to tell me there is no funding i mean is there research at all or do you even know anymore there is research there is research and so for for like myself i used to have two fundraisers a year for my son we would raise maybe six thousand dollars that&amp;#39;s 20 minutes of research so a lot of the funding for research is coming from um just the parents having the fundraisers um muscular dystrophy association i used to work with them a lot and they work with a lot of these small orphan diseases and we would go for a walk go do mba walks and all the money would go towards friedrich&amp;#39;s ataxia okay now are you still even though he&amp;#39;s a young adult are you still doing fundraising for him no when he turned 18 he kind of just went off to dad&amp;#39;s and just didn&amp;#39;t seem too interested anymore so that&amp;#39;s his choice i would love to but you know it&amp;#39;s his choice now okay well well anyhow for those of the listening audience her child may not be the only one with this sort of disease so if you want to donate want to do fundraisers at the end lisa will give you a chance for people to get in contact with you but again just because her child is aged out doesn&amp;#39;t mean it&amp;#39;s not a child who could use any sort of additional funding or services in regards to this um now elisa talk to us a little bit about your faith like did you ever feel like oh my gosh i can&amp;#39;t believe i&amp;#39;m going through this as you mentioned your uh ex-husband moved on to another relationship this is a lot of stuff to bear talk about your faith and talk about did you have a support system along the way to help you through this process um i have always had an incredible faith always and i know that that is what saved me because when you get a diagnosis that your child has an incurable disease that and they&amp;#39;re probably not going to live beyond the age of 25 what do you do with that you know so you either take it and say okay god you&amp;#39;re going to help me with this or you go the other direction um so my faith stayed very strong now i did have peace where i was mad at god and i yelled at him cussed him out a little bit and i&amp;#39;d apologize and okay i&amp;#39;m human sorry about that i had a moment um i had a great support system of friends and the muscular dystrophy association actually was a huge support just because um i had my son as the ambassador so he would go do little talks when they would do fundraising and he would go talk to the firemen and go do uh fill the booth you know he was it was a way to get him out and present um he would go to camp every year they have a camp for these kids at camp seymour every year they have it and each camper gets their own specific counselor it was the best time in my son&amp;#39;s life so i just made sure i used the resources that were available yeah chef look shout out to camp seymour i went down when i was in the sixth grade so yeah so if i had a good time back then i&amp;#39;m sure you had a great time as well um but also talk about uh i don&amp;#39;t want julian to get lost in the process talk about what it was like to parent him because like you said you have a child with a special needs and a child who who didn&amp;#39;t or does not have special needs and you also talked about how julian wanted to be the big brother but talked about how you was parenting him and did did he ever feel left out in regards to parenting and needs julian is my bright shining light he is definitely god put him right after roman because he knew roman was going to be incredibly difficult julian never complained julian was just the best kid ever and unfortunately as a single mom i worked a lot and i you know i didn&amp;#39;t get support from their dad so i worked a lot and unfortunately i&amp;#39;d have to ask my son younger one can you hang out with roman for a few hours i have to go i just have to go to work for a few hours that was so hard for me because that&amp;#39;s not his job he&amp;#39;s supposed to be the little brother but sometimes we don&amp;#39;t have choices so julian never expressed any um what&amp;#39;s the word for it he he never complained about it he never seemed upset about it he never said mom i don&amp;#39;t want to watch my brother just now he&amp;#39;s 19 and now he expresses sometimes he feels like he was forgotten but he knows he wasn&amp;#39;t you know he i think you do the best with the situations that you&amp;#39;re dealt so julian i went out to lunch with them just a few weeks ago and it was just so beautiful to see roman can&amp;#39;t just lean up and take his coat like the rest of us can&amp;#39;t you know he&amp;#39;s got to like really move his hand and focus and you&amp;#39;d see julian just lean over and grab it very discreetly and help his brother i mean he just did things very discreetly to help him so roman kind of still felt capable if you will but it was just so beautiful to see my son my little one just take that natural caregiving you know roll towards his dog as his brother i think the thing about you that i want to give um you credit for is is a lot of times like you said i got to do what i got to do to make things work to to also to bring in money so for julian to be able to say mom basically in his own words i got this i&amp;#39;ll watch my little brother speaks to what you have done um and i don&amp;#39;t again i don&amp;#39;t know dad so i don&amp;#39;t never ever want to just count the other party but also give credit where credit is due for both parties i tell people if you have great kids and i fundamentally believe if you have great kids because you both poured in them the your own special way i don&amp;#39;t get into me i don&amp;#39;t get it you had them ninety percent dad had him 10 or dad and 98 they&amp;#39;re great boys because you both poured into that so just always you don&amp;#39;t need for me to say it but just always remember that they&amp;#39;re great boys because what you did when you had them as well if they&amp;#39;re great boys now maybe look roman&amp;#39;s eating habits ain&amp;#39;t the greatest doesn&amp;#39;t mean he&amp;#39;s not a great dad look we&amp;#39;re gonna work on that piece but yeah that that&amp;#39;s good and thank you you know i didn&amp;#39;t feel maybe left out or missed additional things maybe growing up but he understood the importance of being there for his brother so kudos for you for doing that um now where does julian live does he live on his own nope he lives down the street with his dad as well they live literally less than a mile from me so um their dad has a ginormous house they each have their own floor so they have it they have it made over there okay the only thing that worries me is like my house is very handicap equipped i had actually rebuilding tacoma come over and they built a wheelchair ramp in my backyard they redid my whole bathroom for roman or handicap accessibility so like i said like it you&amp;#39;re not going to be shown the resources you really got to dig and find the things that are available there are really a lot of things available for people that don&amp;#39;t have the money to take care of things like that so i just feel so blessed i was able you know to get people over here to help me you know make my house livable for my son and his dad he&amp;#39;s got this beautiful home but there&amp;#39;s no wheelchair ramp for him to get out of so that kind of worries me a little bit um but other than that they both live down with their dad they&amp;#39;re doing good um i see them you know i see them often not as often as i&amp;#39;d like but right well you know what&amp;#39;s as as i got this perplexed look on my face if your house is handicapped and will cess wheelchair accessible so they&amp;#39;re having to work a little bit harder over dad&amp;#39;s house maybe a bigger house but and i mean and you know as a caregiver so he may have to lift roman up he may have to okay so there&amp;#39;s a lot more work going over there at dad&amp;#39;s house um now i don&amp;#39;t know if you communicate with that is there a reason he may not want to make his house um wheelchair accessible or are you like i don&amp;#39;t know buddy i don&amp;#39;t know i don&amp;#39;t yeah i don&amp;#39;t know i i ask my older son all the time like because literally he doesn&amp;#39;t leave the house much he sits in his room and plays video games all day and it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s sad as a mama to watch him not have a good quality of life you know he gets lonely he wants a girlfriend he&amp;#39;s a handsome kid but i don&amp;#39;t think there&amp;#39;s a lot of encouragement you know dad works a lot stepmom works a lot i think they just leave him to his own devices which is fine that&amp;#39;s their choice um mom&amp;#39;s very different i&amp;#39;m kind of hands-on you know right yeah no go ahead go ahead when he comes to visit i make him go outside with me and we walk around the block with the wheelchair you know he hates me every step of the way but i know how important sunshine is i know the vitamins it gives us so mom gets kind of pushy but oh well yeah but you know what again i&amp;#39;m thinking the parenting styles i think about what you did all the ways you parents him and all of a sudden again dad says all right i&amp;#39;m using terms i got it from here but i guess the question becomes is like what do you have if i&amp;#39;ve been doing it a certain way and it&amp;#39;s been working so a part of what you&amp;#39;re saying hey i&amp;#39;m used to getting him out there&amp;#39;s a swimming pool but if he&amp;#39;s not doing that stuff over there it makes you think like all this work i&amp;#39;ve done what was it for i&amp;#39;ve never really thought that before actually i really have it um i just kind of and you don&amp;#39;t have to be honest byron i like that they&amp;#39;re at their dads because it was a lot of work for a really long time like i would sleep three or four hours a day tops i sleep more now than i&amp;#39;ve ever slept in my life so you enjoy the break i have to say because it was it was non-stop go go go go go and so them being with their dad is just fine with me but i wish my son would come more i&amp;#39;m also a healer i work with energy healing people it would be so detrimental to my son to be over here and i just pray about it i don&amp;#39;t get mad about it i just say god you&amp;#39;ll you&amp;#39;ll take care of it for me whenever i hand it to god it always works out sure always yeah oh i try not to reflect too much on the past i mean it&amp;#39;s hard not to sometimes but just trying to move forward from here try to pray for him to get over here a little bit more right right but you don&amp;#39;t get resistance from the other party allowing roman or julian to come over you don&amp;#39;t get resistance from dad saying they can&amp;#39;t it&amp;#39;s just them getting out and getting over here um it&amp;#39;s just well i mean i wish i could go see roman moore but his dad doesn&amp;#39;t like me at the house like i wanted to come see him on his birthday last year and his dad was like um no you&amp;#39;re not coming over for his birthday so it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s you know i it&amp;#39;d be easy for me to go visit if it was allowed hopefully it&amp;#39;ll get better since our kids are getting older i hope okay okay now does i know you said roman spends a lot of time in the house does julian work because he maintains employment he&amp;#39;ll okay so he&amp;#39;s he&amp;#39;s more or less julian&amp;#39;s been working since he was 14 started working for my brother doing construction now he&amp;#39;s at costco he&amp;#39;s awesome okay good good awesome yeah well now a part of our show family matters is to educate empower and encourage you you&amp;#39;ve done you&amp;#39;ve won you&amp;#39;re still on the journey but you you&amp;#39;re beyond the beginning you&amp;#39;re almost toward the end meaning your son is he&amp;#39;s he&amp;#39;s older now he&amp;#39;s a young man but what can you encourage any any listening listening audience a parent anybody who might be going through something similar in regards to um needing resources of support what can you encourage folks who are going through this this journey right now like i said don&amp;#39;t wait for things to come to you it&amp;#39;s like honestly you have to be an advocate for your child you have to be the one doing the research you know when i went to get him on social security disability they denied us twice even though he has an incurable disease you don&amp;#39;t ever give up i didn&amp;#39;t give up nope my son deserves this money he&amp;#39;s not ever going to be able to work um i just encourage people just be your child&amp;#39;s advocate you are the only one that can speak for them take the resources that are available you know it was my uncle that told me about rebuilding together why don&amp;#39;t you apply alisa apply for help if you need help don&amp;#39;t ever be afraid to ask for help i used to never ask for help and then when i started i was like wow life can be so much easier easier than i ever thought so you know sometimes we have to humble ourselves and just take the help that&amp;#39;s available because it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s not an easy job but i feel i feel special that god trusted me enough to take care of such a special child and he gave him to me to take care of so i took what i took it more like that rather than being upset with the disability that makes sense yo totally totally thank you for that yeah yeah i think again anybody listening in again who is or on this journey about to go through this journey i think those words of encouragement you give uh were really helpful now let me ask you this how do people get a hold of you so is your time or you want to give an email address a phone number because somebody may contact you and say thank you for that or i&amp;#39;m going through how can a listing audience get ahold of you and what&amp;#39;s the best

many people in my ear telling me what to do and how to raise them and this and that and it&amp;#39;s like if you just listen to yourself that&amp;#39;s the most important thing you know let quiet the outside noise and really listen to your own heart and what to do with your kid amen yeah i i agree with you there you get a lot of outside noise coming at the end of the day when the lights go out and

    "transcript": "hey guys my name is molly and i&amp;#39;m 24 years old i wanted to tell you a little bit about my rare disease frederick&amp;#39;s ataxia or a fe for short it is a rare neuromuscular disorder that causes um the gradual diminishing of the ability to walk scoliosis cardiomyopathy diabetes in some cases slurred speech hearing problems eye problems and a lot of things i don&amp;#39;t know the list goes on but um so i inherited it from my parents and i i had a 25 chance of getting fa as well as being a carrier and then um there was a 50 chance of just being a carrier of the ffa but not having the disease itself and then then 25 chance of not being the hairier or not having a fate and um [Music] i got the 25 that carries it and has the disease my sister does not carry it and she does not have the disease and we don&amp;#39;t know where my brother is he never got tested but he is 35 now and he doesn&amp;#39;t show any signs so he probably doesn&amp;#39;t have a faith so no one in my family had a fate until me just kind of showed up out of the blue um there is the it&amp;#39;s the statistic is one in 50 000 people have fa so um i have met a few other people who do have it but it&amp;#39;s not a common thing that you&amp;#39;ll see someone just out and about and be like hey you have fa too um so i was diagnosed when i was 10 years old the biggest thing i noticed was that i had trouble walking up and down stairs and that really embarrassed me so that was a big thing that i told my parents like this isn&amp;#39;t right i walked so much slower downstairs and um another factor was that i got sick with the sinus infection and i went to my doctor and they listened to my heart and noticed i had a heart remember and they were like it&amp;#39;s probably nothing but we&amp;#39;re gonna send you to cardiologists just in case and the cardiologist like he knew from the web off that something else was going on so he pulled my mom and dad aside and my dad says the doctor even had tears in his eyes as he was like molly has a form of muscular dystrophy so another thing my disease fredericks ataxia it falls into umbrella categories muscular dystrophy and ataxia so if you&amp;#39;ve heard of those terms they are not diseases themselves they are an umbrella term there are like 46 forms of muscular dystrophy and 13 forms of ataxia but don&amp;#39;t quote me on that um so the doctor thought the doctor knew i had muscular dystrophy so we went to um a neurologist and we did some blood tests and it only took a few months because um the blood test was developed for fa in 96 i believe until then they couldn&amp;#39;t really for sure diagnose you with fa was all kind of um based on observation so i did the blood test and yep i had a faith so um i at that age i never i i felt like they diagnosed me with the wrong condition i knew something was wrong but i didn&amp;#39;t feel like i had a faith i didn&amp;#39;t feel like it was that extreme and seven so i still walked in everything until seventh grade the campus was a lot more spread out and we transitioned classes so i didn&amp;#39;t really need it but i used a scooter because we weren&amp;#39;t sure how i would navigate classes that well so i used a scooter and that really embarrassed me so when eighth grade came around i just walked and i continued walking from classes and not using any device until i was um until my senior year of high school so i break well back then i broke my feet a lot because they fell so much so when that did happen i would use the wheelchair because they hadn&amp;#39;t used scratches um so the most recent time when i was 17 i broke my foot and when it was healed and i got out of the wheelchair i couldn&amp;#39;t walk without assistance and so from there i got a walker and then i went to college when i was 18 and that campus was huge it&amp;#39;s at least it covers miles my college was so big so i couldn&amp;#39;t walk that i used a wheelchair and then a power chair so now i&amp;#39;m 24 and i&amp;#39;ve lost the ability to walk uh i use my manual chair my power chair most the time and then uh when i&amp;#39;m at physical therapy i do use a walker every now and then i don&amp;#39;t really like to walk it&amp;#39;s hard and i&amp;#39;m not gonna get it back so what&amp;#39;s the point you know um but yeah i&amp;#39;ve been i&amp;#39;ve been going to physical therapy for about 14 years because that is the only um treatment that there is they tell you just to keep your muscles strong because um fa what it is is everyone&amp;#39;s body makes this protein called fertaxin my body doesn&amp;#39;t make enough for toxin so my cells are in a constant state of starving starvation and they&amp;#39;re slowly shunning down and dying and that just kind of has a domino effect on the rest of my body so it&amp;#39;s pretty cool it&amp;#39;s on chromosome 9 i believe yeah so it&amp;#39;s in my dna it&amp;#39;s pretty cool how um how i was made to have buffet basically but yeah so the only treatment they recommend is physical therapy because your muscles are in a constant state of weakness and dying they say to find it through exercise and strengthening your muscles but that doesn&amp;#39;t work super well because i&amp;#39;ve been in physical therapy for 14 years and i&amp;#39;m still in the wheelchair so but yeah thanks for watching guys i plan to do more videos i&amp;#39;ll i&amp;#39;ll see you around bye",

    "transcript": "very cool all right so now I&amp;#39;m delighted to welcome back our taxia expert Dr Susan Pearlman Dr fman is the clinical professor of Neurology and director of the ATT taxia Center at the UCLA Medical Center in Los Angeles welcome Dr Furman thank you thank you so much for inviting me back and already we&amp;#39;ve got some good questions that are being posted one was posted in the chat as opposed to the Q&amp;amp;A let me start with that one this is from Chris um and he says it&amp;#39;s not meant in any way to speak ill of his neurologist I presume it&amp;#39;s Chris he but I do want to pose a question so he has Scot three as did his mother uh been seeing his neurologist one who&amp;#39;s not Nat taxia expert but been seeing them for about 10 years curious as to whether there&amp;#39;s any point in continuing to see my doctor each visit seems to be the same we talk I describe my encounters and recent Falls and not much more occurs my doctor has made referrals for speech and swallowing number of sessions of physical therapy which have been helpful other than that he&amp;#39;s still living with the expected progression and aging that comes along the way so his question is would you say there is more that one should expect from a neurologist relationship when there is no cure number one it looks like all the basic rehab bases are being covered that you know appropriate PT referrals speech and swallowing referrals which is very important because we all know that that rehab always helps it helps you design your home program it helps you be aware of you know potential hazards reduce your risk of falling and it&amp;#39;s good to have a knowledgeable medical partner who can help you with that um if there were symptoms of the general neurologic type muscle spasms and pain dizziness things that can accompany sca3 and the other axas even a general neurologist is familiar with medications for symptoms so I think it&amp;#39;s good to have you know an ongoing relationship even if it&amp;#39;s only once a year so that if a problem does arise you know a bladder problem or something that neurological input could be helpful with you&amp;#39;ll have that channel open but the one thing you don&amp;#39;t want to overlook is access to other resources like upcoming clinical trials your general neurologist may not be keeping up with trials that are opening up that could be you know a good trial for you to participate in so in that way I think networking through National taxia Foundation looking at the we sitee where they&amp;#39;ll post open trials that are recruiting can sometimes fill in some of the gaps that your general neurologist may not be totally up on so you have to do some of the work too um but I I think it&amp;#39;s always good to have you know a neurologic medical partner on your side so I wouldn&amp;#39;t give up that relationship now going back to the Q&amp;amp;A um do I have any initial update on vico&amp;#39;s clinical trial you we all know that Vico has started their phase one study for SCA one and SCA 3 um that they have begun enrolling and it&amp;#39;s going to be looking at safety and dosing when I asked them how soon they thought they might enlarge into a bigger study a study looking not just at side effects and dosing but also at potential good effects and when they might be applying to the FDA to run the trial in the United States they said they thought in general next year um some of their data timeline suggests it may not be next year it may be early in the following year so as they get data I&amp;#39;m sure there will be press releases that that we can um you know benefit from um and learn from any other potential treatments for um spinal cerebel taxi at type 3 that are approaching a clinical trial well we know the Biogen drug was put back on the drawing board because of concerns that at higher dosing there could be some significant side effects so that drug hasn&amp;#39;t gone away but it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s back to being modified to potentially make it safer to use at lower dose the CEOs study of the infusion of intravenous treos which is a sugar Moy that can get into the aggregate protein that&amp;#39;s building up in spinocerebellar taxia type 3 break it up and make it easier for the body to get rid of it that study was open it was enrolling it&amp;#39;s currently paused um while they they rearranged you know some of the um you know the operational factors we&amp;#39;re hoping that it will reopen for recruitment sometime in the next you know before the end of the year so that&amp;#39;s one I&amp;#39;d keep an eye on um but you&amp;#39;re currently there aren&amp;#39;t a lot of available clinical trials for any of the spino serbil Taxas that are openly recruiting in the United States um the stemon stem cell trial is still operating only outside the US for Scott two and Scot 3 um and and potentially Scot 6 um they&amp;#39;ve got you know work they&amp;#39;ve done in Taiwan and in Japan and I believe in South Korea um so I think the upcoming year will hopefully bring more clinical trial opportunities not just for Scot 3 but for the others as well now Colette has a question since Scott 3 is an inherited disability do we know if it gets worse with each person um that gets it in the family line there are several things that determine how severe the symptoms of any of the axas might be one is the size of the mutation and with sca3 and some of the other scas that have mutations that are called triplet repeat mutations when that Gene is passed on to the next Generation there&amp;#39;s about a 10% chance that the mutation could get bigger the symptoms could come on earlier and be more severe so that&amp;#39;s only 10% risk in a family line from generation to generation but there can be other factors that determine you know severity of symptoms and and how how well your body can accommodate them lifestyle factors other medical illnesses whether you&amp;#39;re exercising or not so you know taking care of General Health you know being aware of you know environmental exposures to avoid like too much alcohol um and and you know taking care of your general Rehabilitation status can help stabilize the presentation of any of the skar Paul has a question my cerebella taxia symptoms began in 2014 so that&amp;#39;s not quite 10 years ago after a bad case of sinusitis which ended up in the hospital for three weeks getting all of his medical paperwork together he&amp;#39;s found an MRI report from 2008 which was before that hospitalization when he was dealing with back pain so not exact L clear why they image your brain when you were getting a back pain evaluation but the MRI stated at that point um that there was measurable significant cerebellar atrophy now this was before the hospitalization with that severe infection so something was going on before then that was taking away reserve and you comment that you didn&amp;#39;t have any symptoms until that potential triggering event so disorders that behave like this are typically genetic where you&amp;#39;ve carried a gene mutation for a taxia um and you know you&amp;#39;ve had it since you were born it slowly starts taking away Reserve but you can still perform without obvious symptoms until you hit you know a certain level of loss or the there&amp;#39;s a triggering event you know a major surgical with general anesthesia or a head injury or a severe other illness as the sinusitis that would then you know take away the last little vessages of reserve and allow the symptoms to appear um and then you mention some history of fainting Syncopy when when you were very young I don&amp;#39;t think that&amp;#39;s connected to the at taxia you had Epstein bar chronic fatigue when you were 14 if that didn&amp;#39;t trigger Axia symptoms in your teen or early 20s probably is not a considered a triggering factor although people who develop Epstein bar illness can develop a chronic estein bar picture that often presents with chronic headaches or chronic fatigue syndrome that is ongoing not necessarily A taxia so if there isn&amp;#39;t a document the genetic factor in your family perhaps evaluating for a possible underlying infectious inflammatory condition maybe related to the Epstein bar that could have damaged the cerebellum early on and then led to the later onset of symptoms one quick way to look for that there&amp;#39;s blood work that can check your immune system but a spinal tap might show if there&amp;#39;s any lingering Epstein bar inflammatory things going on that could be behind your cerebellar syndrome Briana um has a question how common is it to have repeats on multiple SCA genes Brianna&amp;#39;s daughter tested positive for um SCA 8 and also has repeats um on several other genes um for instance 32 and 30 repeats on a taxin one which is just shy of the borderline threshold so there&amp;#39;s two theories going on here there&amp;#39;s two thoughts there are several families where just by the luck of the draw they have two Axia genes running in the family some people have one some people have the other some people inherited both here though you&amp;#39;re talking about repeats in you know an extensively normal range but on the high end of the range as you say just shy of the borderline threshold so there has been some research done looking at the total burden of repeats if every one of your Axia genes has the normal number of repeats you know you can add them up and they&amp;#39;ll never reach a critical threshold of ADD itive difficulties but there has been a theory that&amp;#39;s been under assessment looking at people who have one clearly mutated Gene but may have larger repeats on other Ataxia genes that could add to the burden of the gain of function so this is an active area of research and I would urge your daughter to get involved with the um natural history study for spine cerebell taxia where more of this could could be studied Hugh has a question do I think rosol might slow progression of SCA 6 so in the European studies of razol for a taxia all kinds of Axia genetic Axia dominant recessive and even non- gentic Axia there was a suggestion in one study that it could improve symptoms of a taxia and in a second study that it might slow progression but they didn&amp;#39;t divide it up into the genetic versus the non- genetic it was just the it taxia population as a whole now trool which is biohaven research drug um which turns into riao in your system once you consume it in two studies that they&amp;#39;ve published the data on and and are busy working on the data you know hoping to be able to get a a successful review by the FDA it did suggest some slowing of progression some symptomatic benefit slowing of progression but not particularly for a taxia type six in the first study it was a taxi is one and two that seemed to have some benefit in the second study it was a taxia type three I think one reason it might have been hard in that study to measure slowing of progression in a taxia type 6 is a taxia type 6 progresses already very slowly at half the speed of the other a Taxas so if there was some slowing of progression it might take more years of observation to appreciate that plus the mechanism of a taxia type 6 um in part is that gain of function um toxicity aggregate mechanism that the other axas share but in Axia type 6 there&amp;#39;s also a dysfunction in the calcium channels that control the electrical activity of those atop Pathways so you know you&amp;#39;re dealing with two different mechanisms of disease one of which may be more responsive to really as all the other one may not be so I think we need to look for better classes of drugs in the pipeline for a taxia type 6 that could address one or the other of its two unique mechanisms Teddy has a question about hyperbaric oxygen um and what dose might be effective now hyperbaric oxygen is an accepted treatment for several different things for you know a a a deep sea diver who&amp;#39;s coming up and gets nitrogen bubbles in his system I think they put them in a hyperbaric chamber pressure chamber um that to try to get rid of the nitrogen and and restore normal oxygen for wound healing higher oxygen concentration can be helpful in pushing back against bacterial infection improving circulation and oxygen supply to Healing um areas for a taxia it&amp;#39;s not clear I don&amp;#39;t think that you know I&amp;#39;m not going to say no we&amp;#39;d have to go back to the literature but I&amp;#39;m sure there have been published studies about hyperbaric oxygen therapy for genetic disorders for axic disorders for movement disorders I am not aware that the evidence is strong enough to Warrant committing yourself to that series of treatments so I&amp;#39;m not going to say any more about that but I think I will look up some hyperbaric oxygen references just to see what the research has been I know Dr zeswitz at the University of Florida did a review of the literature a few years ago looking at all the things that had been tried drug trials and other re you know other research protocols for exercise Etc and only came up with two things that seem to have enough evidence to Warrant off label or more common use one was razol and one was deladine a drug that was approved for Ms and appears to have some benefit for people with episodic Axia so hyperbaric oxygen didn&amp;#39;t make the cut in her data review Steve has a question first I want to say you know really appreciates you know being able to you know participate in this forum um and he has a specific question about pain or a constant state of discomfort he has late ons set freed rkes now in his eighth year of symptoms currently taking and I presume some of this is for pain 600 milligram of Gabapentin commonly used for nerve pain 30 milligrams of bphen commonly used for muscle spasm pain pramipexol at a modest dose which is commonly used for the discomfort we associate with restless legs which can happen in freed Dres and any of the other axas that have neuropathy as a component and 15 milligrams of Meloxicam which is used for um you know Garden variety inflammatory muscle soft tissue pain um so that&amp;#39;s quite a cocktail and still has Perpetual discomfort um now back in the day I used to work in our pain clinic so I&amp;#39;m familiar with the complicated mechanisms that can mediate pain um and I know in freed Rees neuromuscular pain restless legs very Comm so if we think the Perpetual discomfort is related to a restless legs phenomenon the dose of pramipexol could be increased and even though restless legs typically occurs at night there are people with that discomfort that occurs during the daytime so they&amp;#39;ll take the pramipexol spread out over the course of a day increasing the meloxicam is probably not going to deal deal with this unusual pain experience but if we feel you know that it&amp;#39;s a neurogenic pain Gabapentin could be used at a higher dose bphen could be used at a higher dose um there are also non-drug pain strategies um Physical Therapy may have pain relieving techniques ultrasound um transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation deep tissue massage um and if you haven&amp;#39;t tried any of the non-drug strategies they probably are worth trying to see if they would help a little bit medical hypnosis has been used for chronic pain from a variety of sources and it it does work it Alters the way your brain perceives the pain the pain signals might still be there but medical hypnosis which actually works through Pathways that are mediated by endorphins um which is where narcotics work um you know you can modify your endorphin Pathways with medical hypnosis biof feedback other psychological techniques um so I don&amp;#39;t think you need to learn to live with this chronic discomfort is distracting it it definitely takes a big bite out of your quality of life so I would explore some non-drug strategies some physical therapy strategies you may not have tried yet potentially increasing Gabapentin increasing backlin or using the pramipexol in a in a wider way Kelton has a question is there a value in genetic testing um so boy there are several aspects there that that we should discuss first of all I we had a wonderful Grand rounds this morning um at UCLA about the advances that have been made in genetic testing um back from the day when the very first a taxia genetic test was was developed and was available commercially to now where we have access to whole exom sequencing genome sequencing multiple tests for you know triplet repeat expansion disorders like the spinocerebellar Taxas so um you know we&amp;#39;ve made a lot of progress but you know you&amp;#39;re pointing out here that you got the test for scaf five eight years ago eight years ago the bill came back for $110,000 so you wonder if that was for a single Gene test or if they just did a panel where they screened eight years ago and Athena Diagnostics had a panel eight years ago that looked at all the known Axia genes at the time um dominant and recessive you know Scot five is a dominant one um and the cost was around $10,000 and when whole exom sequencing you know the medical version of 23 and me you know became available screening for even rarer a taxia jees the cost could run you know upwards of $8,000 very close to that so you had to fight with insurance to get them to cover it uh it was negative so it seems that you if they sent a single Gene test and it cost you $10,000 that&amp;#39;s unreasonable I suspect they sent a panel um you were looking for SCA five um which I I don&amp;#39;t know why it was decided to look for that one in you particularly um but it came back negative and it didn&amp;#39;t seem worthwhile to go on a fishing Expedition when there&amp;#39;s probably nothing actionable that can come of it so um currently there are things you can do with a positive Gene test um number one you can counsel other family members number two if you know the mechanism of action of that Gene you might be able to design treatments that could specifically make up for that problem or become involved in targeted research not just general Natural History research or biomarker research but there will be pipelines for all of the commonly identified a Taxas um if you go to the Naf website you&amp;#39;ll see they have beautiful drawn out pipelines which are a little a little bare in some cases right now but will be growing for the common axas where there are drugs in development that will come into clinical trials that if you are positive for one of those Gene tests you can participate in it so you&amp;#39;re right a fishing Expedition is a concern it would be important to find out what they actually tested for for $10,000 and if you did want to move forward with you know additional testing for some of the newer genetic factors certainly if you have a positive family history it&amp;#39;s worth to consider looking for that um because with the available genetic testing in undiagnosed families we have about a 70% chance of finding a genetic factor that is the one that is running in your family if you don&amp;#39;t have um a family history there&amp;#39;s a you know maybe a 20% % chance a genetic Factor could be found um but you&amp;#39;d have to decide which type of genetic testing to do and you&amp;#39;d have to try to get authorization from your insurance um and you&amp;#39;re right the insurers years ago were hesitant to cover any genetic testing um because there was nothing you can do but now there are things in the pipeline that I think will offer opportunities so don&amp;#39;t give up on it yet now Maria um you know her son is um nine years old and has Scott 13 um this is you know not not one of the common axas so um you know it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s rare has problems with concentration and fatigue uh for example he spends about four hours at school is very tired and unfocused afterwards um parents have to repeat to him several times to do ordinary activities you know remind him constantly to wash his hands not to walk around when getting dressed because that&amp;#39;s dangerous what can I recommend are there any therapies or supplements that can improve his condition so fatigue which can alter concentration and can really impair activities of daily living is very common in all the axas patients with fatigue ability benefit from two different well three different approaches um a a general non-fatiguing exercise program that is done daily can help build up reserve and help with endurance and reduce fatigue ability so that&amp;#39;s one thing we&amp;#39;d want to make sure that that he&amp;#39;s participating in number two some of the antioxidant vitamins although they haven&amp;#39;t been that effective at you know free radical Scavenging and protecting nerves from genetic stress they have been helpful for fatigue so you might consider a trial of lowd do CoQ10 as an example um third there are anti- fatigue agents that can be used in adults um and you know in kids drugs that are stimulants for adults you know may may have a calming effect in children think of drugs for um you know ADHD for instance you know that family of drugs is used used in kids to help you know improve concentration where there&amp;#39;s hyperactivity but in used in adults they&amp;#39;re actually stimulants so I would have a discussion with your pediatrician about whether a prescription drug would be appropriate for at least a short-term trial but you also want to make sure that there&amp;#39;s not something else going on is he sleeping well you know disrupted sleep at night for a 9-year-old can really impair performance the next day so make sure that nighttime sleep is restful um that he&amp;#39;s getting enough hours of sleep um and then a final area you know with young people you know especially teenagers but even a nine-year-old um problems with concentration fatigue um distracted Behavior could be a sign of depression and that should also be looked at you don&amp;#39;t want to overlook a depression that that could be treated very effectively and and could open you know open you know turn the lights on for for this young man an has a question does a cute cerebell Ataxia have ADHD Tendencies now I&amp;#39;m not sure what you mean by acute cerebellar Axia um but there are I mean acute Axia usually isn&amp;#39;t going to cause ADHD it&amp;#39;s you know could be quite disabling if it&amp;#39;s sudden onset um but we do know that cerebellar involvement whether it&amp;#39;s acute or chronic can itself alter concentration um you know ability to focus you know difficulties with speed of memory and thinking can alter mood and this goes back to that nine-year-old you know thinking that there&amp;#39;s a cerebella issue that could be behind some of his you know behavioral issues but um if the cerebell a taxi in in this case is contributing to some Behavioral or emotional changes they do respond to treatment so you know don&amp;#39;t just write it off to your Axia but actually seek some treatment that might settle those ADHD Tendencies and improve your your quality of life and daily performance Elise has a question any update on omav for children um the um you know Riata has been uh Acquired and and om Sky Claris has been acquired by Biogen there are plans for um an an official phase two type study to look at you know dosing side effects long-term benefits in younger children but there is currently soon to start a phase one study which will be done um I believe at Children&amp;#39;s Hospital of Philadelphia um it&amp;#39;s interesting it was posted on clinicaltrials.gov but they weren&amp;#39;t quite ready to to initiate it because of the change in hands of the drug from Riata to to Biogen but that phase one study to establish some basic dosing um and side effect parameters will hopefully be kicking off in the in the next month or two and then next year we should have a longer term study that will recruit um you know people from you know more than just one site now I know that in the friedes community um there are some children underage 16 who have been able to get the drug prescribed by their local neurologists and get it approved by their insurance and get it dispensed from the biologic Central Pharmacy three big hurdles for off-label use of an adult drug in children will your doctor prescribe it will your insurance authorize it will the pharmacy you know dispense it so apparently they&amp;#39;re getting it and I think there will be some data from you know the parents of those youngsters about how the children are doing relative to side effects and they&amp;#39;re going to be taking an adult dose that may be too much for a kid so we have to we have to really look at Safety First any promising studies for cardiomyopathy for kids so Children&amp;#39;s Hospital of Philadelphia has spearheaded for the last few years and and the group at Cornell um more detailed Natural History data collection about cardiomyopathy in FA kids this is going to be important because any of the treatments for cardiomyopathy obviously the earlier you start them the better the long-term benefits will be because the cardiomyopathy is life-threatening um but there&amp;#39;s currently no way to predict who of the younger patients who have onset of their freed RS with neurologic features are going to be at greatest risk for the cardiomyopathy that can be so devastating you know in even in their teens or 20s um and there are studies going on now which on the phah website they do list them that you know will hope give us more information about that um okay so Ace Roberts is anyone else experiencing 10 to 15 second seizures ah seizures are we sure that they&amp;#39;re seizures um or are they just episodes of Axia or episodes of dizziness if they are true seizures there you are very few documented genetic axas that can include epileptic seizures um those can be diagnosed they can be treated but on the other hand other episodic features that may be interpreted as seizure like episodic dizziness and vertigo episodic Ataxia where all of a sudden you&amp;#39;ll go from being reasonably balanced to being staggering and unable to stand up so I it&amp;#39;s not clear what you&amp;#39;re referring to there there are a group of a Taxas that have episodic features um that you know can be treated with medications like Del ferine and other medications so you know we we should probably better Define what um what these seizures are Teresa any recent updates and treatments for Scot tube um there are one or two drug companies that are currently preclinical um drug development specifically for Scott 2 um so they&amp;#39;re not yet ready for human trials um but you know I think they could be added to the pipeline um as preclinical and hopefully over the upcoming year um you know we will be able to have um you know phase one Trials of new new drugs in development for Scott 2 um Daniel what syndromes are related to Freed taxia okay so syndromes well you know freed taxia is not just a neurologic disease um it involves the nervous system the spinal long nerves which control coordination control you know muscle tone and reflexes control sens ation in in the legs and and ultimately the hands you know may have an impact on speech as well speech and swallowing all neurologic features and in some patients with free rkes there can be changes in vision and hearing then there are Orthopedic syndromes which are closely related to the neurologic developmental syndromes whereas you know the muscles and nerves direct them so the bones grow hence scol iosis high arches hammer toes foot deformities then there are the purely medical um aspects you know the the heart related problems that we&amp;#39;ve just talked about where there could be changes in heart rhythm changes in heart performance um then there are um the risk of diabetes because of involvement of the pancreas there&amp;#39;s felt to be some related increased risk of um inflammatory bowel disease you know there was you know a study done through the Natural History database and there seemed to be an increased incidence of inflammatory bowel disease in patients with freed Dres um we know that there can be Garden variety GI track changes constipation um GI motility issues um gastroparesis where the stomach doesn&amp;#39;t empty properly there can be problems with bladder muscle and the bowel you know G tracted bladder muscles are different from our our regular muscles different from heart muscles um so that there can be bladder involvement so in looking at you know the various symptomatic syndromes that can present you know there you know are many many things that are under the umbrella of somebody&amp;#39;s with freed Dres at taxia um and if you were asking a different question than the one I answered I I apologize um there are things not associated with freed rkes there isn&amp;#39;t an increased risk of cancer there isn&amp;#39;t an increased risk of immune deficiency that we see in some of the other pediatric axas Olivia is there a best medicine for Tremors there are standard medicines for Tremors that have been used for for Generations um the most common one is um Propranolol a beta blocker that&amp;#39;s been used for heart and for blood pressure problems s and it can work very quickly to calm down um an action tremor that you know may come from the cerebellum um if that doesn&amp;#39;t work the next choice is usually a drug called primidone which is in the phena barbital family and it seems to have a very specific effect for Tremors at higher dose it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s obviously used for epilepsy um and then there are some second and third line drugs for TR tror so depending on where the Tremor is and how severe it is and what kind of tremor some specific types of tremor respond to drugs that are used in Parkinson&amp;#39;s disease that really is quite distant in its triggering um area from the cerebellum um there are drugs in the Valium family I think a common one is Clon asaam which can be used for certain types of cerebellar tremor myoclonic tremors as an example um you can also use various Physical Therapy interventions um you know for eating you know weighted utensils a heavy cup a heavy Fork a heavy spoon can reduce the interference of tremor there are actually eating utensils that are designed um you know to be easily used by people with Tremor so that even if your hand is shaking the spoon stays level um wrist weights can sometimes suppress a Tremor so there&amp;#39;s a lot of interventions including more severe ones deep brain stimulation you know which has been in use for Parkinson&amp;#39;s Tremor and other types of tremor but it&amp;#39;s always better to work with non-invasive strategies first Lisa has a question is there any medication for dizziness after all these years okay the list of medications for dizziness if you go to the National Taxi Foundation website they have a a little handout that talks about symptomatic medications and and the list of ones that can be used for dizziness probably has about 20 entries on it and I have patients who have tried every one of them and none of them work I think for dizziness you can either usually start with something like the drugs used for seasickness which calm down the inner ear so there&amp;#39;s less stimulation going to the balance Center and that can reduce the sense of dizziness can also make you drowsy which may not be good for your Axia um some of the anti-seizure drugs that are in use for things other than seizures gabop penan we&amp;#39;ve already talked about its use for pain may have benefit for dizziness used at modest dose um damine the drug that we had mentioned for episodic a taxia May calm down one of the central dizzy Pathways so I would you know suggest discuss it with your doctor go to the National facy Foundation website look at the list check off the ones you&amp;#39;ve already tried and if there are ones you haven&amp;#39;t tried um discuss it with your physician Danny have you heard of SCA 43 well they&amp;#39;re up to SCA 50 so I think we&amp;#39;ve probably all heard of SCA 43 um and you know that is the best guess of diagnosis from you know DNA testing so it sounds like you&amp;#39;ve had um some DNA testing that showed some change in the gene associated with SCA 43 and I&amp;#39;m going to have to go back and look at up find out what that Gene is and what the reported mutations are but you&amp;#39;re right sometimes the genetic testing will show an obvious mutation that is known to disable that Gene but some times it&amp;#39;ll show a small change in a gene that hasn&amp;#39;t been 100% correlated with a taxus symptoms and that&amp;#39;s where involvement in the research you know working with a Doctor Who&amp;#39;s going to keep up with the research you know giving a DNA sample for some of the genetic testing that&amp;#39;s going on looking at new Axia gen looking for new mutations can help answer some of those questions art has a question question do you see many SC six patients with orthostatic hypotension or what about an overactive bladder now both of those are from the autonomic nervous system that you know acts without our voluntary participation in maintaining blood pressure controlling our bowels and bladder controlling our heart rhythm um so the things that we don&amp;#39;t have to think about but that there are nerve Pathways that control them I have had one or two patients with SCA 6 with some unstable blood pressure I&amp;#39;ve had more patients with SCA six who have an overactive bladder that probably comes from incoordination of some of the voluntary muscles involved in bladder support and bladder control so autonomic changes in SCA 6 are unusual but they have been reported and then remember the sca six tends to occur in older patients over the age of 50 where some of these autonomic changes may just come with the aging process so here&amp;#39;s an anonymous attendee interested in a taxia and sleep oh there are plenty of research patients papers that can be found and what you might try doing is Googling a taxia and sleep because the Google search will highlight not just you know um you know uh you know people trying to sell you medication for a taxi and sleep but it will highlight some of the research articles that have been published through the National Library of Medicine um as a practitioner I have actually you know through my institution access to PubMed which is from the National Library of Medicine I don&amp;#39;t know about your access as a non-medical practitioner but if you ask your physician um if they have access to that um research database they can directly pull down more articles but Googling you know you&amp;#39;ll actually come up with some some research articles and hopefully some review articles um or I could send you know a list of you know some of you know the article that that I have um in in my repository I can send it to um to Lori and you know given that you&amp;#39;re an anonymous attendee I&amp;#39;m not sure you know how you would connect with her but you know you can try contacting her and see if i&amp;#39; I&amp;#39;ve actually sent that list so iPhone 139 if your cerebellum is ller or damaged can it ever grow back or heal from damage it&amp;#39;s you know nerves that have been lost are not going to grow back with our current technology work with stem cells work with nerve growth factors you know is looking at healing cerebellar damage or spinal cord damage I think is where much of you know much of that research is going on damage from stroke so there there are drugs that are being studied and treatments being studied however even with some mild cerebel atrophy or damage you do have Reserve that can be drawn on to reconnect so think of somebody who&amp;#39;s had a stroke you know with good uh you know aggressive Physical Therapy they can actually bring in new connections from the undamaged areas that will take over from the damaged areas so the same thing with the cerebellum with aggressive physical therapy and home exercise programs you can draw on and build that Reserve Sean um what Solutions do you recommend to treats best to currently take bphen but what you know prefer to reduce the um need for medication okay so non-drug strategies um for spasticity you&amp;#39;re right bphen is the oldest and most commonly used one damine and a taxia drug that we&amp;#39;ve already mentioned may have some impact on spasticity um dantrolene Tizanidine so there are a number of drugs valium can be used for severe spasticity physical therapy probably has strategies for stretching um for muscle stimulation that can help um reduce spasticity um stretching is probably very effective at reducing the nerve signals that trigger spasticity so a good stretch program should be able to reduce your need for medication um electrical stimulation um we&amp;#39;ve talked about transcutaneous electrical stimulation you know where they put electrodes on your skin I don&amp;#39;t know that you know this surface electrodes will reduce spasticity um Botox injections into the  muscles can help relax them but could make them weak spinal stimulators have been used as well as spinal drug pumps to pump bphen at lower dose directly into the spinal column all of these are ways to treat spasticity but you know the least invasive is probably going to be Physical Therapy interventions um you know and then possibly you know if if you don&amp;#39;t want to be taking a daily medication consider some Botox um and really only at the extremes of spasticity do we look at spinal pumps and and spinal stimulators surely um David Price&amp;#39;s mother um he passed away in his sleep at the age of 33 in 2001 I vividly remember David and and you and working with your family I don&amp;#39;t know what caused his death but I can look that up we should have some record in our older notes um and I will get back to you about that possibly through the Naf but I may still have your active contact information um passing away in your sleep with a taxia is usually due to some type of central sleep apnea where you&amp;#39;re you know the breathing Center in your brain stem that&amp;#39;s supposed to keep going while you&amp;#39;re asleep just stops working because of brain stem progression of your Ataxia but another complication could be in some types of ataxia there are changes in heart rhythm and patients May develop a rhythm problem during sleep that stops their heart um and I&amp;#39;ve seen this happen in in patients with a number of different types of Axia but you know surely I I will get back to you carry can a non-affected carrier have symptoms such as not being able to ski but can ride a bike um non-affected carriers if it&amp;#39;s a recessive disorder like Fredrik um typically carriers have no symptoms they have no motor problems they have no medical issues for instance um but there are um some people who for whatever the reason could never learn to ride a bike but are able to do other things where they&amp;#39;re standing on two feet so you think about it when you&amp;#39;re riding a bike it&amp;#39;s all your core and Core Balance and stability while when you&amp;#39;re skiing or dancing or roller skating you&amp;#39;ve got two feet on the ground which is a different approach to um balance and coordination but if you&amp;#39;re a carrier of a recessive disease it is not contributing to that symptom discrepancy that you have noticed Cheryl I&amp;#39;m getting IVIG treatments every three weeks sounds like this is being given for an identified um immune problem where there&amp;#39;s a bad antibody that has been found I&amp;#39;m still experiencing balance and disequil disequil disequilibrium problems would more frequent infusions be helpful um typically IVIG is not given more frequently than every three to four weeks I have one patient who&amp;#39;s getting it every two weeks and felt that it definitely worked better um so the question is immediately after a treatment do you get some relief that may last a week and then begins to decline that could be a sign that you might need more frequent infusions or a different approach to what may be a bad antibody syndrome on the other hand if the IVIG treatments don&amp;#39;t do anything for your balance and disequilibrium you know maybe IVIG is not hitting the point that needs to be addressed in your Axia Linda um you know oh family with 27b that&amp;#39;s one of the newest discovered a taxia genes looking at the genetic testing and are there other tests that can be done um currently there&amp;#39;s only one lab in the country that tests for Scott 27b and that&amp;#39;s the University of Chicago um so if you are specifically seeking out that test you either have to go to Chicago or your local hospital has to have a relationship with the University of Chicago to send samples to them UCLA lab currently does not have that relationship we did at the beginning of the year something happened with a reorganization between the two Labs currently we can&amp;#39;t send samples to University of Chicago for 27b testing which is frustrating to say the least um so it looks like um at risk family members um you know may have had MRIs you know which could show some changes that would indicate that you know that that Gene problem has been there for for a while um genetic testing availability is going to depend on your institution or whether you live in Chicago um are there other tests that can be done one interesting test for Scott 27b a taxia and people who have symptoms is they seem to have a very good response to deladine that was the drug that we mentioned previously for episodic Axia so one way to document that yeah it&amp;#39;s suggestive it&amp;#39;s in my family I have a taxia maybe my MRI shows some you know some changes um is a trial of damine and if you benefit from it um you know it could be a sign that yeah you&amp;#39;ve got that 27b Gene and you know you&amp;#39;re you&amp;#39;re you&amp;#39;re using a treatment that you know people are accepting has has been very um very effective now I&amp;#39;m going to skip to the middle of the group because we&amp;#39;ve had a lot of questions here and I&amp;#39;ve been only sticking with the first ones which isn&amp;#39;t really fair um so let me go down to um Pauline another question about 27b um now she is taking Del ferine um and PL oxone which you know there&amp;#39;s been some research suggesting it may have a neuroprotective effect but not seeing any benefit which is unusual for 27b as I said you know you know it&amp;#39;s almost diagnostic you know you start dordine and and and there&amp;#39;s an obvious response now one problem with deladine as a prescription drug it&amp;#39;s time release and the immediate release is only available through com compounding pharmacies at this point so it&amp;#39;s possible you would get a better response with um the immediate release formulation of Dal ferine through a compounding pharmacy um the um now the the chlorzoxazone you know I&amp;#39;m not so sure would be of benefit and then you had a question about um you know acetazolamide uh which has been used for episodic Axia it&amp;#39;s used variably you know for you know conditions that might respond to dfine might respond to acetazolamide it hasn&amp;#39;t been documented to be a benefit for 27b yet at this at this time now Sally also has a question interested in Sleep Disorders asking you know so I&amp;#39;m wondering if Sally was the anonymous person that had asked the original question so I&amp;#39;m going to make sure that when I go back to my you know repository of articles that I can direct um Naf to be in touch with you and and we can get those things to you and then we here here have another anonymous uh attendee when people say I have cerebellar a taxia isn&amp;#39;t that the same thing as saying I have a taxia I thought all a Taxis are cerebellar they are not you can have a taxus symptoms from from problems with the signals going into the cerebellum the cerebellum could be fine but if it&amp;#39;s getting the wrong input you know it&amp;#39;s you know garbage in garbage out so if your sensory Pathways bringing in sensory information to the cerebellum are defective as they are early on in fredes they can cause a taxia in the face of basically a normal cerebellum the inner ear signals if they&amp;#39;re not getting in properly you can have dis equilibrium which can lead to a taxia so you always want to sort out is the cerebellum the problem or is it one of the input Pathways that&amp;#39;s the problem Daryl has a question um he&amp;#39;s a Scot s patient and there&amp;#39;s been very good research going on in SCA 7 to develop a better understanding of you know the eye symptoms and some of the other symptoms to devop a better understanding of the gene itself and how it can influence you know Vision Pathways versus influencing the cerebellum and also there has been a pipeline for development of Gene blocking drugs these are the Asos that that we&amp;#39;ve all heard about anti-sense Alon nucleotides ionus Pharma has been working on that um the NIH has a special dedicated research group for sca7 and I would suggest that you get involved with one of the Natural History research groups um so that you can you know take part in any advances in in research and I think we have time for at least one more question um about Scot two we actually have two questions from seon about Scot two uh good question are there seminars coming up in relation to Scott too you know we&amp;#39;ll we&amp;#39;ll ask the nif to set that up you know seon&amp;#39;s mother has got two uh she&amp;#39;s been diagnosed with stage four nons small cell lung cancer metastatic spread to areas on bone and small lesions in the brain she&amp;#39;s done two cycles of chemo immune two more to go decided against radiation what are the effects of chemo and immune therapy on Scot 2 um chemo immune therapy can affect peripheral nerves some of the therapies may affect the brain itself so that if you&amp;#39;re dealing with both cancer treatment and a genetic a taxia um you know the odds are good that the cancer treatment is going to add some disability to to the Scot tube unfortunately so I think will&amp;#39;ll we&amp;#39;ll you know we&amp;#39;ll we&amp;#39;ll call it quits for now and I apologize for not being able to get through more questions but you know just the responses are are so intriguing and so good and and I thank everybody for for participating in in these wonderful sessions yes this was another great session and everyone has asked such great questions so thank you all for joining and thank you Dr Pearlman for being here to answer so many of our questions today for those of you that want to go back and listen again to any of uh the answers that was shared here today this session is being recorded and will be available on our website Within the next week and we look forward to seeing everybody at the next session take care everyone till next time",

    "transcript": "In the last Minutes of Science \nepisode, we learned about frataxin   and what it does within the cell. We learned that frataxin plays an \nessential role in managing iron   within the mitochondria and helping to \ngenerate specific complexes of iron and   sulfur called iron-sulfur clusters.\n \nLoss of frataxin decreases the number   of iron-sulfur clusters, compromises \ncell health, leads to iron accumulation   in various tissues, and potentially, to loss \nof cells through a process called ferroptosis. Ferrum is the Latin term for iron and the \nsource of the chemical symbol for iron, F-e. Ferroptosis, therefore, is a process \nof cell loss dependent on iron. When the most reactive form of \niron accumulates in the cell,   it produces Reactive Oxygen Species or ROS \nthat in turn cause widespread cell damage. ROS are molecules that damage cells and cause \noxidative stress that we often hear about. One of the hallmarks of ferroptosis is the damage   to the fat (lipid)-containing \nmembranes that surround cells. This damage is called lipid peroxidation.  \n \nRob Wilson, Grazia Cotticelli, and their   colleagues at the Center of Excellence at \nChildren’s Hospital of Philadelphia, with   collaborators at University of Pittsburgh, have \ndocumented ferroptosis in cells from FA patients. Evidence of ferroptosis has also been \nseen in FA mouse models and in blood   samples from FA patients.\n \nKnowing that frataxin loss   contributes to ferroptosis has opened \na new potential therapeutic avenue. Richard Possemato and his lab at New \nYork University School of Medicine   discovered that it was possible \nto block the iron accumulation   that is caused by loss of frataxin by removing \niron regulatory proteins using genetic tools. FA cells with decreased levels of iron regulatory \nproteins were protected from ferroptosis. The results of this FARA and N-I-H supported work   have been published in the \njournal: Science Advances. We hope that this new understanding \nof a way to protect FA cells   from ferroptosis can lead to a \nnew kind of treatment approach.\n   Finally, how is iron metabolism \nwithin the whole body affected in FA? Elisabetta Indelicato, who was inspired to \nwork with FA patients as a medical student,   is now at the Department of Neurology, \nMedical University of Innsbruck, Austria,   leading her own FA research. \nDr. Indelicato is investigating   if the hormonal balance that regulates iron \nin the whole body is working correctly in FA. The liver has the largest iron storage \nof the body, and it is the liver that   produces the hormone hepcidin, which \nregulates the influx of iron into cells. In a study funded by FARA, \nDr. Indelicato and her team   are measuring hepcidin levels as well as \niron and copper in the blood of FA patients. In addition, they will also \nmeasure several iron-regulating   genes and frataxin in the \nblood-derived white cells. Using MRI, the iron content in the liver \nof FA patients is also being measured.\n   These studies spanning work in cells, \nanimal models, and finally FA patients,   contribute to our understanding of \nhow iron may affect the symptoms of FA   and whether treatments focused on \niron regulation may be helpful.",

    "transcript": "Welcome everyone! I am Liz Soragni. I&amp;#39;m the \nDirector of Research at FARA. If you joined us the   previous year you probably know that since 2020, \nFARA has been organizing this series of webinars   called the FARA Flash Talks during the month of \nMay. The month of May is FA Awareness Month, and   this year, May 20th is FA Awareness day, and we \nwould like to celebrate this month by bringing you   every Thursday in May some exciting new \nresearch in FA and we have asked Junior   investigators that are working on FA all over \nthe world to share their research with us.   We added a little bit of a challenge to them \nbecause we are asking them to present their   research in just five minutes and one slide and to \nexplain it in very simple terms, in very lay terms   so I encourage you to take this opportunity to \nask them questions and to learn about FA and   about them. We will take questions after each talk \nand you can type your questions in the Q&amp;amp;A box. At the end of the webinar, keep your browser open \nto vote for the best presentation like we did the   previous years. We&amp;#39;ll recognize the most voted \npresentations with an award. The webinars are   recorded and you can watch them later on YouTube \nso don&amp;#39;t worry if you cannot attend all of them.   We have two moderators with me today, Tricia \nand Mike, who will take over in a minute,   and we&amp;#39;ll introduce the speakers and take your \nquestions. Before we get started I&amp;#39;d also like   to mention that FARA is joining fara Australia \nin the Lend Us Some Muscle Global Challenge.   Lend Us Some Muscle is an initiative that \nencourages everyone to be active during   the month of May and help raise awareness for FA. \nYou can request free tattoos. We put the the web   address there on the slide, and Jamie will put \nit in the chat as well. And you can you know,   put a tattoo on your arm or wherever and share a \npicture of your tattooed muscle on social media. This is the agenda for today. And today \nwe&amp;#39;re gonna learn about the biology of FA,   some of the biology of FA and this session \ncovers some new hypotheses of mechanism that can   contribute to the dysfunction both of the cellular \nand the tissue level in FA. As you know we first   need to understand the disease to figure out \nways to treat it. We need to know everything that   goes wrong in FA, all the changes that having low \nfrataxin causes, to be able to develop treatments   and address all the symptoms of FA. So you will \nhear about some toxic protein produced in the   FA cells, about some changes in the metabolism \nor a special type of fat that makes up the cell   membrane, a presence of leaks in the barrier that \nprotects the brain, and how to use a new mouse   model to understand the heart pathology in FA. And \nwith that I will turn it over to our moderators   Tricia and Mike. I&amp;#39;m not sure... I don&amp;#39;t remember \nwho&amp;#39;s going first, but they&amp;#39;ll take it from here. Thank you, Liz. My name is Tricia. I am an \nFA patient. I live with my husband and three   children, and I&amp;#39;m a proud member \nof the current ambassador group.   Our first speaker for the day will be \nLisa Romano of the University of Florida,   and she will be telling us &amp;quot;Does the GAA repeat \nexpansion produce proteins that can damage cells?&amp;quot; Hey, thank you so much, Tricia, for the \nintroduction I&amp;#39;m gonna go ahead and share   my screen. Okay. Alright, so hello everyone! My \nname is Liza Romano. I&amp;#39;m a post-doctorate in the   Ranum lab here in the Center for Neurogenetic \nat University of Florida, and today I am going   to talk about, of course, FA, but for from a \ncompletely different perspective. So, get ready.   So, I want to start by introducing some \nbackground that everybody knows well.   Friedreich&amp;#39;s ataxia is caused by a repeat \nexpansion mutation in the frataxin gene.   In particular, in the internal one uh this GAA \nTTC expansion mutation is repeated several times   and cause fataxin loss so what uh some of you \nmay don&amp;#39;t know is that when you have a repeat   expansion this there is a in a gene there \nis a particular process that can happen this   process is called run translation so now I&amp;#39;m \ngonna try to explain you what this process is   so in our lab we discovered that when you \nhave a repeat expansion in a gene this   repeat expansion can produce uh two different \nrnas uh one in the sensor Direction and one in   the antescence direction and from these rnas \nuh several protein can be produced up to six   um three protein in the sense Direction and other \nthree protein in the antisense direction so when   you think about the repeat expansion itself in \nthe gene you need also to think about the RNA   that will be composed by the same type of repeat \nand that is really true also for the protein so   those proteins that we are gonna call the Run \nprotein from now on are composed by a repetition   of the same amino acid sequence all over again \nso when I start to my boss Docker here at uh I deeply and intensively study other repeat \nexpansion disorders such as C9 or 72 Sky 8   which is another Ataxia and mitonic District type \n2 and what I learned is that those run protein   have the tendency to aggregate in the cells \nand in human tissue they are A protein that are   extremely toxic for neuron in particular and run \ntranslation and RAM protein can be produced when   cells are under stress so those are the potential \nrun protein that can be produced from the GAA and   TTC repeat expansion in the fat oxygen we have \npolyglutamic acid polylizing polyarginine in the   sense Direction and polyphenylalanine polystyrene \nand Polynesian so my question when I started this   project was very very easy thus run translation \nhappen in a thing since fa is a repeat expansion   disorder and to answer that question I use \nuh two different antibody that can Target   polystyrene which is this type of Aggregates \nhere and polyleucin which are possibly the   two anti-sense around protein and fail so I use \nthis antibody to test some human autopsy tissue   and with the a great surprise we found that uh in \ncerebellum uh human tissue we can see accumulation   of polystyrene and the polyleucin in the dentite \nnuclei and in the also in the molecular layer   of the cerebellum and granular cell layer so \nthose Aggregates those red huge Aggregates are   present throughout the cerebellum and that&amp;#39;s \ntrue for polystyrene and also for polyleucin   so what is important is that um those protein \nare present is true in the fa patients but they   are not in FA carriers so that that throw us \nin a completely new world and we are trying   to understand if the mitochondrial defect that \nwe see that is caused by photaxine loss can be   a trigger for run translation to happen so in the \nnext couple of years or hopefully more I will be   um trying to untangle this around translation uh \nin FA I want to understand this the mitochondrial   defect can trigger and translation I want \nto deeply study those uh run protein in   particular therefore missing and to do that \nI&amp;#39;m planning to develop some new antibody to   study them Vector I want to see if those run \nprotein in FA are toxic especially for neuron   and cardiomyocytes but most importantly \nI want to see if the therapeutic approach   that we have in place for other repeat \nexpansion disorders such as C9 or 72 or approach that we can possibly use to treat fa so \nwith that I conclude my talk and I want to thank   of course Safara to give me the opportunity \nto carry on this fantastic project that I&amp;#39;m   very passionate about and also of course my mentor \nLaura Numa which is very very supportive of me and   is a fantastic project and of course I thank \nyou all and I&amp;#39;m happy to take any questions we have one question so if anybody else has \nquestions please throw it in the Q and A section   the one question for you is when you refer to \nstress what kind of stress are you talking about   okay so what we know especially from uh well \nI study uh really really uh intensively C9   uh I&amp;#39;m talking about uh ER stress uh which is \nuh one of the stress that can cause a protein   accumulation but also I well I have some \nevidence of mitochondrial stress that can be   involved in a random protein accumulation \nbecause by treating with H2O2 which is   um stress or I can see an increase of ram \nprotein in a C9 or 72 in that context but   generally potentially every type of stress can \nbe a trigger for Ram translation to happen really   so we are studying um deeply those things there is one word question do I \nhave timeless yeah yeah sure okay okay um the next question is \nhow long did this Study last sorry is uh can you repeat the \nquestion how long did the study last   uh this study I I did start working on on \nfa in Augusta so is a really new brand new   project uh that I&amp;#39;m planning to to work \non uh in the next few years and hopefully   um if I will continue in the \nacademic World maybe for longer   there are q a I don&amp;#39;t know if you see them \nTrisha but one is about studying uh polyphenol   phenomenon polyphy yeah you study polystyrene \nand polyleucin well yeah we study polycedine   and polyleucin because we produce the antibody for \nother uh ataxias and those other Ataxia accumulate   policy in a policy and this is why we have so many \ninformation about these two run protein that are   very toxic uh so I&amp;#39;m right now developing a new \nantibody to Target every single one of them and   to study them better and I have to say that the \npolyphenylalanina is the most well to produce the   antibody for it is very difficult so what I am \ndoing is to try to study that in an uh you know   over expression and in vitro kind of model right \nnow because I don&amp;#39;t have uh yet antibody available   but I predict and maybe I&amp;#39;m wrong that this is \ngoing to be a very nasty protein to to work with you see the the other two there&amp;#39;s another \none about how if longer repeats uh lead to   a lot larger amount of Iran translation \nuh well they&amp;#39;re longer the repeat the   longer uh the uh the amino acid sequence \nwill be so potentially you have a bigger   Aggregates for example uh but yeah we we see \nsome correlation with the repeat length but   I cannot really speculate that on on fa \nbecause it&amp;#39;s like a work in progress and   just started is definitely something that I \nwill look into and try to see if there is a   correlation between the repeat length and the \nyou know how toxic how bad those proteins are and there&amp;#39;s one last one yep have you \ndefinitely concluded that round proteins   have not accumulated in carrier tissue okay \nso uh that&amp;#39;s a very great question so right   now I&amp;#39;m uh I did the screen uh six fa \npatients and two uh career which are   um they don&amp;#39;t have any policy in and poly losing \nAggregates um I definitely have to to look into   all the other Ram protein really and we are trying \nto collect some more sample for the fa carrier in   order for me to add more into the um cohort \nthat I already analyzed but by now the career   that I analyze they are not accumulating any \nof the polynucine and polythene um run protein and I did conclude that by by IHC \nand uh using these two antibodies and there is another question Lisa for the GAA \nrepeats heavy study interruptions of the repeats   and the effect on the protein that&amp;#39;s a fantastic \nquestion and this is something that I will   definitely dig into it uh because you know we we \nknow from other diseases that Interruption can uh   you know modulate this type of protein so we would \nlike to to see if Interruption make things worse   um yeah it&amp;#39;s definitely something \nthat we&amp;#39;re gonna look into it but we   didn&amp;#39;t yet yeah it&amp;#39;s a project that just \nstarted last August so you need to wait I don&amp;#39;t see any other questions at \nthis time so thank you very much   for this presentation if anybody does have \nany further questions you can drop them in   the Q a and we will come back to them thank \nyou I&amp;#39;ll stop for sharing my skin thank you   at this time I would like to introduce Mike \nAnderson who will introduce the next presentation   hi all uh I&amp;#39;m a parent of two sons with fa and \na retired neuroscientist so for whatever that&amp;#39;s   worth um all right our next talk is by zanushka \nRam tutor from uh Brunei University in London   so very far away uh welcome and she&amp;#39;s going to \nspeak on the role of sphingolipids in FA so so for   those of you don&amp;#39;t know much about sphingo lipids \nthere in essence fat molecules of a certain type   thank you thank you very much Mark for \nthe for the introduction I&amp;#39;ll just share   my share my screen uh like Mike said I&amp;#39;m \nzenishka I&amp;#39;m a second year PhD student   at Brunel University London in the United \nKingdom and today I&amp;#39;m going to be talking   to you about the research that I&amp;#39;m working \non for my PhD project which is the role as   finger lipids or certain kind of fat in FA \nand if we can Target this for the disease   so I&amp;#39;ll start off by explaining a little \nbit what happens in fa so as you heard   um from the last speaker uh Frederick&amp;#39;s attacks \nhere is characterized by a ga repeat expansion in   the fxn Gene and what happens is when we have this \nmutation we have a reduction in the level of the   protein protection when we have reduced levels \nof the protein protection this has an impact   on the mitochondria if without this protection \nprotein the mitochondria cannot have the activity   that it needs to have and it also leads to iron \ntoxicity leading to increases in oxidative stress   and eventually cell death this leads to symptoms \nsuch as difficulties in Walking cardiomyopathy   and skeletal deformities sometimes patients can \nbecome wheelchair-bound and have a shortened   lifespan so it&amp;#39;s really important for us to look \nat all the different Avenues in FA and see how we   can treat it so what I&amp;#39;m doing is looking at the \nrole of swinger lipids or fats which have been   investigated in other neurodegenerative disorders \nsuch as Alzheimer&amp;#39;s and in Parkinson&amp;#39;s and seeing   if this can have an effect in fa so what are \nfinger lipids so sphingolipids are a kind of fat   that you can find in your cell membrane and these \nare involved in controlling the levels of cell   growth and the levels of cell death so what we \nhave is a Cascade of reactions which leads to the   formation of a fat called ceramide ceramide can \nthen be converted by these things called enzymes   into different fats which can control cell growth \nor cell death so ceramide and sphingosine are   fats which control cell death whilst sphingosine \none phosphate and ceramide one phosphate or s1p   and c1p for short are involved in promoting cell \ngrowth so what I&amp;#39;m doing for my project is looking   at targeting the different enzymes involved in \nforming these fats and seeing if they have any   improvements in fa so in the Ataxia research lab \nat Brunel University London we have two different   kinds of models the first are in vitro cell lines \nderived from patients of fa and the other is an fa   Mouse model we have ygha and yg8 extra large \nwhich have over 800 GAA repeats so the first   thing to look at was to see if there were in \nfact any differences in the levels of these   fats and what we found is that there&amp;#39;s a reduced \nlevel of s1p which is involved in promoting cell   growth and an increased level in ceramide which \nis involved in promoting cell death so then what   I did was have a look at which enzymes actually \ncontrol the levels of ceramide and s1p so that   I can then investigate these so sphk is involved \nin promoting s1p and lpp is involved in promoting   ceramide levels so the next step was to look \nand see are there any changes in this and so   what I did is I looked at the gene expression and \nprotein expression by shown gene expression here   but they showed the same Trend in that there is \na reduced level of sphk at an increased level of   lpp I also then confirmed what I found in the \ncell lines in the fa Mouse models and found an   increase in lpp protein expression and a decrease \nin sphk protein expression so following on from   this The Next Step was to Target this to see if \nwe can increase the activity of sphk and decrease   the activity of lpp and see what effect this had \nso by activating sphk and improving its activity   I&amp;#39;ve actually found that there are increases \nin FX and gene expression following this   furthermore after reducing the gene expression \nlevel lpp I found an increase in the sphk level   at the gene expression level as well as increases \nin effects and gene expression so now that I&amp;#39;ve   found a difference in the levels of these finger \nlipids and that in fact targeting these enzymes   had an effect on fxn it was important to look and \nsee are there any changes in the mitochondrial   dysfunction that we have in FA and so looking at \nthe mitochondrial reactive oxygen species as well   as the activity through mitochondrial membrane \npotential I found that by targeting these enzymes   we can reduce the levels of this reactive oxygen \nspecies in the mitochondria as well as improve   the mitochondrial membrane potential so I.E \ngiving some sort of indicator of mitochondrial   activity in FA cell lines as well so having \nseen these improvements I have prophesied that   these targets could potentially have an effect on \nother mitochondrial dysregulation found in FA and   potentially could have an effect on for tax and \nprotein expression and this is really important   for going forward because it outlines a different \nmechanism by which fa could be happening inside   the body I would like to take this moment to say \nthank you to Farah for giving me the opportunity   to give this talk as well as everybody in \nthe Ataxia research lab at Brunel for all of   their support and thank you to you as well for \nlistening and I&amp;#39;m happy to take any questions thank you for uh a very nice \npresentation uh way over my head uh   I guess one question I have is is are \nthese sphingolipids uh affected by um   reactive oxygen species that we know are a part \nof the the sequelae that fa patients go through   yes so it has been shown in not in fibroblasts or \nan fa in particular but in other cell types that   reactive oxygen species can trigger the levels of \nceramide and vice versa so it&amp;#39;s not quite clear   which of these happens first if reactive oxygen \nspecies it&amp;#39;s sugaring ceramide or ceramide is   triggering reactive oxygen species but we know \nthat there is some interaction between them are these sphingolipids sort of uniformly \npresent in brain and heart and you know   throughout after all every living cell has \na membrane so is there any differential   so the ones I&amp;#39;m looking at specifically they are \nvery much abundant in the mitochondria so you are   going to find them in those cell types in those \ntissues like you mentioned like the brain the   cerebellum the heart those um tissues which very \nmuch rely on the mitochondria you do find those   in there they can also be localized to other parts \nof the cells such as the endoplasmic reticulum and   the Golgi apparatus as well but it is more or \nless uniform in those sort of places where you   get the mitochondria so we have a question from \nthe audience uh you show a decreased expression   level of stingosine and an increase in ceramide \nhowever the decrease in the increase are within   the error bars therefore my question you is \ndo you feel that expression change is real   which is always a question and researcher or \nanything yeah so some of the disparities that   we find when we do our experiments can come down \nto the level of the ga repeat expansion so because   of the cell lines that we have some of the cell \nlines have maybe 300 GA repeats all the cell   lines have 700 to 800 GA repeats and it has been \nshown in literature that the greater the length   of the ga repeat the greater the impact this is on \ntranscription and the reduced levels of potassium   and further down Downstream effects of the of \nthe disease so a lot of these um um issues that   we have in terms of variability comes from that GA \nrepeat expansion but the general trend is the same do you have access to other other cell \ntypes from from the patient population   uh cheek cells or you know something Beyond \nfibroblasts so the reason that we use fibroblasts   are typically because they are easier to grow in \nin the lab they grow quite well and also a lot   of research done within when within fa uses \nfibroblast because they&amp;#39;ve been established   they you can buy them quite easily from The \ncorial Institute and obtain them so that&amp;#39;s   one of the reasons why we use the fibroblast \ncell lines currently we don&amp;#39;t have any other   cell types but this is one of the reasons why \nwe use the fa Mouse models and take tissues   from them to see if there are any changes in \nthose tissues and that are highly affected   in FA but it&amp;#39;s a good point and it would be \ngood to look at some other cell types as well I have um like a general question of do you \nthink this changes that you see can is are a   good way to measure how this disease progresses \nover time our do you see changes for example in   the mouse you know do they get worse yeah I \nthink it I think it&amp;#39;s a good way one of the   aims that I have when I reach the final year \nof my PhD so in around October November time   of this year is to have a look with these Mouse \nmodels and do things like rotoro tests hang wire   test grip strength test and see if there are \nany effects over time with the mouse models   as well as doing some dose studies as well with \nthese with these drugs and seeing if there is   any effect on the ability to walk the the grip \nstrength and afterwards taking those tissues and   again evaluating the gene expression and protein \nexpression and seeing if there&amp;#39;s any change there you&amp;#39;ve obviously given a lot of thought to \nthis aspect which is a fairly new aspect for   fa research do you have any ideas about \nhow this could be therapeutically useful um we I are any improvements in the ability of walking \nor in the strength of these mice if these drugs   could then be further put into clinical trials \nlet&amp;#39;s say after animal studies there could be   a therapeutic effect there particularly looking \nat the fact that there has been some improvements   in gene expression level if there is shown to \nbe an improvement at the protein expression   level as well this could potentially could have an \neffect in the mitochondria in reducing that iron   toxicity and that oxidative stress rather than \njust targeting the antioxidant effect which is   what some treatments in clinical trials are doing \nnow and how our motherlocked alone works as well are there any other questions from the audience \nso there is one in the Q a so the question is how   many individuals take part of the study but so \nmaybe you know um we can ask or is the the 500   fiber plus from one uh individual for multiple \nindividuals and do they you know do you see them   in all of them in all the different lines if they \nare you have multiple lines yeah so these are uh   different patients so each repeat that I do is \nwith a different patient cell line so I will have   at least three different uh healthy individual \ncell lines and at least three Fida um fa uh   individual cell lines as as well I can&amp;#39;t remember \nwhat the other part of the question was sorry   but that was that was it yeah if you have \nmultiple lines that your fibroblast line   comes from multiple delivers yeah \nyeah they&amp;#39;re multiple patients so   in the Ataxia research lab we have around \neight different ones about eight healthy   ones eight fa ones and we try to use \nas many as possible in in the studies our next person is Francis Smith out of the state   um University of New York at Buffalo and the total \nof her presentation is is your brain zipper down thank you Trisha for the \nintroduction let me get started here okay so thank you so much Trisha for the \nintroduction and for the opportunity to   speak today um my name is Francis Smith and \nI work in the Daniel J&amp;#39;s Osman lab and we are   at the University in Buffalo in New York and \nthis is us over here in the lab uh you might   not know us very well yet we are pretty new to \nthe faqc we&amp;#39;ve only started researching and at   Bay in the past couple of years but we have \nfound that it&amp;#39;s a very excellent Community to   be a part of we&amp;#39;re happy to be here everything \nthat I&amp;#39;m going to talk about today has been in   the development of my PhD degree here at Buffalo \nand I&amp;#39;m going to be asking you for the fa brain   is your brain zipper down and hopefully by the \nend of the talk you&amp;#39;ll know what I mean by that so instead of what we would normally think of \nin an fa talk talking about the brain I&amp;#39;m not   going to be talking about the whole brain but \ninstead I&amp;#39;m going to be talking about the blood   vessels which sit right on top of the brain \nand this is often also called The Blood brain   and if we zoom in it&amp;#39;ll molecularly what this \nlooks like the blood-brain barrier is exactly   what it sounds like it&amp;#39;s a layer of cells that \nphysically separate the blood from the brain   and it has a very important job so the blood \nbrain barrier has to provide nutrients that   travel through the blood such as oxygen and sugars \nso that the brain cells can get these nutrients   but it also has to make sure that there aren&amp;#39;t any \ntoxins or any germs coming from the blood into the   brain and the reason that the blood-brain barrier \nis so good at this is because of two architectures   cellular architectures I&amp;#39;m going to talk about \nso the first one we can think of like they are   the teeth of a zipper so these are proteins \nwhich sit at the edge of neighboring cells in   this blood vessel here and they make it so that \nthey the neighboring cells can be zipped up tight   the second structure that&amp;#39;s important to this \nis proteins that sit underneath the zipper   and they&amp;#39;re kind of like Lego bricks so a single \nLego brick doesn&amp;#39;t offer very much structure but   when the Lego bricks are attached up in a nice \nwall they can really give a strong structure   and so both of these two different cell \narchitectures the zipper teeth proteins   and the Lego block wall are important in making \nso that the blood-brain barrier can do its job   of making sure that the right molecules enter \nthe brain and no bad molecules under the brain   and so for a little bit of background information \nit&amp;#39;s been found in Parkinson&amp;#39;s disease patients   that bad zipping between these cells can cause \ndamage to the brain cells that sit underneath   these blood vessels and the reason that we need \nto protect these brain cells also called neurons   is because these cells are very very sensitive \nto any kind of damage and so the hypothesis for   my factual thesis has been that bad zipping might \nbe causing a toxic brain environment in FA as well   I&amp;#39;m going to talk about three results that I&amp;#39;ve \nfound so far the first is that in my essay models   of these uh blood-brain barrier cells we lose some \nof the zipper teeth between the individual cells   and if you&amp;#39;ve ever had a jacket with a broken \nzipper you know that then the zipper isn&amp;#39;t very   functional secondly I&amp;#39;ve found that my Lego brick \nwall is disrupted and not only is it disrupted   but there are some proteins that prevent \nthose Lego bricks from lining up very well   and finally I&amp;#39;ve found that these changes come \nalong with the ability for molecules small   molecules to move between these cells and remember \nwe don&amp;#39;t want that to happen because the cells   that we&amp;#39;re supposed to be protecting are the brain \nneurons and they&amp;#39;re very vulnerable distressed   so in total what I found is that we have \nchanges and those two architectural parts   of the cell that I talked about we have less \nthat repeat protein and we can&amp;#39;t form a nice   structured brick wall beneath us and so what \ndoes this mean for the future of essay research   there are some medicines that can help the \ncells make more zipper tea proteins and so   what I&amp;#39;ll be answering in the next part of \nmy research and further on in my career is   it these medicines by improving the zipper teeth \ncan help the environment of the fa patient brain   so finally I would like to thank the American \nHeart Association for supporting my projects   for the final two years of my PhD program for \npharah for the invitation to see today and   for all of the listeners so I thank you \nall and I&amp;#39;m happy to take any questions there is a question what are the zipper tooth \nproteins and the Lego block proteins called   the zipper teeth proteins there are two zipper \nteeth proteins um uh one of them is called   Claudine and the second one is called occluden and \nthey are actually stuck to the Lego proteins by a   third protein called zo1 or zo2 and the Lego \nblock proteins are called actin so um these   are part of what we call the cytoskeleton it&amp;#39;s \nexactly what it sounds like it is a structural   skeleton that sits in the cells to make sure that \nthe cell has the right kind of structures foreign any work to find what molecules might support \nthe barrier and keep it more structurally sound   that&amp;#39;s uh what I&amp;#39;m moving on into right \nnow when I&amp;#39;m looking at some of these   medicines to see if we can help support \nthe structure of the zipper teeth proteins   um there are some therapies to help support \nthe structure of the Lego brick proteins but   it gets a little bit complicated because uh \nkind of charging this pathway might end up   changing some other parts of the cell in terms \nof what we call the redox potential so if there   are any oxidative stressors it starts to get \na little bit complicated when we try to change   um The Lego brick wall problem but the zipper \nteeth problem um hopefully can be an 86. okay Liz would you like to interpret the next question \nsure I think it is asking if maybe the if there&amp;#39;s   a really this um this leak in the blood Mania \nwouldn&amp;#39;t that cause a bigger effect in FA   um it depends uh there are a couple different \nkinds of leaks um what we know of as a stroke   is a big leap in the blood vessel um but there are \nblood vessels of all different sizes in the brain   so we can see up in my picture as well there are \nsome really thick big blood vessels and they they   can be smaller um so the smaller blood vessels \nwould be for instance micro capillaries and if we   have a small leak in those micro capillaries it&amp;#39;s \nvery hard to detect um so it can be a spectrum I&amp;#39;m more curious about how how did you \nget to this idea why did you you know   um did you have any indication on any um that \nthat this was an issue in FA or how did you get   to the idea to study the blood barrier that&amp;#39;s a \ngood question it was a lot of friends speculation   um we actually are a blood-brained barrier \nlab we are not a free work to taxi a lab so   we didn&amp;#39;t have any access to Patient MRIs um or \nany kind of patient brain samples to look at you   know the possibility for any weeks but what&amp;#39;s \nalways been striking to me is the presence of   brain iron accumulation and disease um which \nthere&amp;#39;s a little bit of literature showing   that the brain iron accumulation happens \nthroughout the entirety of disease versus   the uh the times of disease where the brain \ncells are dying that&amp;#39;s really early so I was   kind of interested to know why this brain iron \naccumulation is happening continually and could   it be coming from if there are any leaks in the \nblood-brain barrier because of course iron is   very present in the blood so if we get any kind \nof micro bleeds like I talked about that might   be a reason that we&amp;#39;re seeing that brain energy \nsituation and that led to this whole hypothesis is there any evidence that that these defects \nare in one part of the brain and not another   reason these are endothelial cells \nby and large I assume yeah yeah   the other ramification of course is that \none of the difficulties with drug therapy   in the nervous system for fa patients is that \na lot of the drugs don&amp;#39;t pass the blood-brain   barrier so you know find finding this out and \nwhether it is differentially an issue could be uh   of great impact on drug access and so on \nyes I agree um from what I know about other S as um blood-brain barrier breakdown um whether \nthat is regional you know specific to one area of   the brain or not um I&amp;#39;m unsure that is something \nthat I would like to understand because as we know   the fa brain itself is affected differentially in \ndisease you know the cerebellum is really affected   versus parts of cerebrum are less packed so that \nis certainly you know an interesting route to   take and like we&amp;#39;ve said earlier um until we have \ntherapies and cures I think that the best way to   approach these pathologies of fa is to not leave \nany stone unturned you know and really try to look   at all of the pathologies that we can to \ntry to find some therapeutic Essentials well thank you Francis I think we probably should \nmove on to the to the final contribution in this   hour and it&amp;#39;s coming to us from uh Tyler perfect \nand he&amp;#39;s from Pfizer and it&amp;#39;s going to be quite a   shift from what we have been talking about because \nnow he&amp;#39;s going to talk about uh cardiac potential   problems and the use of mouse models in particular \nin heart failure in an fa model um Tyler   all right thank you Mike for the \nintroduction go ahead and pull up my slide all right so as Mike mentioned this is \nless of a research project and more a   new tool that we hope that other researchers \nin the fa Community will be able to utilize   so us as well as plenty other of research utilize \nmouth models in order to study disease uh in a   living animal as well as to potentially test \nTherapeutics on there are a number of different   Mouse models for fa many replicate the entire \ndisease as it occurs in human patients but   there are also specific models that only affect \ndifferent parts of the body for fa there are   a number of different models that only remove \nfor toxin from the heart of mice while keeping   it present in the rest of the body this still \ngenerates a lot of symptoms such as heart failure   in these mice models which allow for researchers \nto really focus in on key symptoms of FAA   now in the field there is a commonly used Mouse \nmodel called the mck for tax and mouse model that   I&amp;#39;ve got pictured here in red on the slide \nthis is widely used but we&amp;#39;ve generated what   we&amp;#39;re calling the new mck for tax and model \nthat&amp;#39;s going to be pictured here in blue   and we generated this model because we hope to \novercome some of the disadvantages of the old   nck model which the main disadvantage is that this \nmouse model is a very severe form of the disease   so here on the right I have a graph that \nis actually echocardiographic data which   is an important indication that&amp;#39;s used \nin human patients but I&amp;#39;ve relabeled   it to hopefully make the point that your heart \nhealth can be very good or it can be very bad in   um unaffected individuals as well as fa patients \nnow here in red you can see the old mck for tax   and model begins to show symptoms as early as \nfive to six weeks old which is very young for mice   this progresses over the next couple of weeks \nwith an increased heart size cardiac hypertrophy   which eventually does lead to heart failure and \nthese animals are no longer able to survive after   around nine to ten weeks of age now while this \nis good in the sense that you can get studies   like finished quickly in that short amount of \ntime it does pose a problem in that you have   a very short window in order to look at the \ndisease as well as test potential therapies   especially if you&amp;#39;re trying to prevent the therap \nthe disease from even occurring in the first place   with our do mouse model the new mck we&amp;#39;ve \ngot that pictured here in blue you can   see that up until nine weeks of age which is \nwhen the old model would begin to pass away   our model as far as we can tell is basically \nindistinguishable from uh unaffected Mouse even   though it doesn&amp;#39;t have any for tax and expression \nin the heart instead what we get is starting at   around 13 weeks of age and going to around 18 \n19 weeks of age in these animals we begin to see   um symptoms pop up but they occur uh in a much \nslower fashion and they still do eventually   reach the same severity that we see with the old \nmck mouse model but it takes a lot longer and it   occurs much slower which is uh useful for a mouse \nmodel it allows these animals to live longer into   adulthood it allows researchers more time to test \ntherapies and to see if they can reverse these   changes that aren&amp;#39;t occurring so dramatically and \nso our hope is that you know this new model will   be able to put out into the fa field and that it \nwill be able to help researchers who are looking   at uh correcting the heart symptoms that occur \nin FA in order to hopefully find new Therapies   and with that I&amp;#39;d like to you know thank \neveryone here at Pfizer who&amp;#39;s been a part of   this project everyone at Farah for the opportunity \nto speak and uh to the audience for listening in all right we have a question and it is was cardiac \nfunction assessed between the old and the new   mck mice was there any echocardiogram studies to \nlook at hypertrophy or cardiomyopathy progression   yes so we&amp;#39;ve been able to perform both of those \nstudies not simultaneously but we&amp;#39;ve been able to   um perform them separately on the old and the new \nmice and as I mentioned before the progression   is a little bit slower in the newer mice but they \nstill do reach the same level of severity in terms   of uh echocardiographic output there&amp;#39;s a follow-up \nquestion or another question here what explains   the difference in the timing of the phenotype \nonset and decline do you have any insight in that   yeah so um you know I won&amp;#39;t dive too deep \ninto the genetics um but what we can say is   that our new mouse model initially does have um \na little bit more for Texan being expressed than   the old model not anything that would be above the \nexpression of a wild type animal or an unaffected   animal this model just seems to take longer to \nreally remove all the frataxin from the heart and we have another one uh first uh evaluation \nwhat great work are you finding a demand for your   new mouse cardiac Mouse model and I&amp;#39;m wondering \nhow interested the research Community is in   cardiac research specifically well so this is \nthe first public disclosure of this mouse model   actual actually so you know we are hoping that in \nthe future when this research is published that   the field will be able to have access to the \nmouse into incorporate it into their research   and there is a fair amount of interest in \nthe cardiac aspects of fa um heart failure   or any sort of arrhythmia you know is a is a \nvery uh devastating cause of mortality and Fa   patients and you know that&amp;#39;s the reason in and of \nitself for fa researchers to focus on the heart   um so this slower development is it uh is it \na dilation kind of uh beginning to failure in   other words do you see early on you know 14 weeks \nor so do you see that the the heart is gradually   dilating and thinning or you know what are the \nwhat does that look like in the mouse yeah so at the earlier time points um you know \nespecially at the nine week or so time   point the hearts are indistinguishable \nfrom and a wild type are unaffected   Mouse heart as this progresses we do start to \nsee a shift towards um hypertrophy we have um   increased heart size increased size of the \nleft ventricle um and we do also see um some changes in the dilation of the heart um not able to go too much into that at \nthis point don&amp;#39;t want to get you know   too stuck in the weeds but we do see \na little bit of dilated cardiomyopathy so I guess would you say that does this mouse \nmodel is going to give you insights into what   clinicians should be looking for in their patients \nbecause that&amp;#39;s always a difficult call in in many   patients where they&amp;#39;re compensating but and \ntheir heart is good is managing okay but the   question is who&amp;#39;s going to turn the corner \nto to really nasty potentially fatal failure   is there any insight there from from this new \nmodel yeah that&amp;#39;s a great question you know we   have only done you know kind of the initial \nwork on this model just looking at um the couple of time points that you see on here \na Next Step would definitely be going into some   more of those you know in between time points \nwhen we start to see a phenotype arise to see   if there&amp;#39;s anything specific that we might be \nable to pull out that could give an indication   to clinicians when when our animal goes from not \nhaving a phenotype to having a phenotype to see if   that could be translatable to patients so there&amp;#39;s \na question from the audience could cardiomyopathy   be detected in the early stages uh always be \nfound in Echo in other words is Echo sensitive   enough or is there another another uh technique \nthat would would actually give you better Insight   than simply Echo I realize that goes easier to \ndo but are there other things that you can try Ah that&amp;#39;s a great question um so for us in this initial characterization \nwe haven&amp;#39;t looked at anything   more sensitive than Echo we have been able \nto look at some of these time points at the   um the actual heart of the animals by weighing \nthem and getting the actual heart Mass relative to   unaffected animals and don&amp;#39;t see a \ngross change there but yeah doing a using some more Advanced Techniques we could \nmaybe see something at these earlier time points   um that&amp;#39;s something we haven&amp;#39;t done yet for anybody who&amp;#39;s not worked on a mouse mouse \ncardiac work because of the size of the chambers   and so forth even Echo is very challenging \nuh compared to humans and so forth so uh   here&amp;#39;s an here&amp;#39;s another question in the old \nmck for tax and research model researchers   were able to reverse the damage of the \nheart will the new uh the new model be   also be able to show this response \nif you&amp;#39;ve gotten into treatment yet   um so we haven&amp;#39;t done anything I haven&amp;#39;t \ndone anything in terms of treatment with   the new model but that is definitely you \nknow the next step that we&amp;#39;re looking to   um you know take this mouse model both you know \npotential treatments that have already been   published um whether that be gene therapy or you \nknow any sort of small molecule studies as well all right I don&amp;#39;t think we \nhave any other questions um yep I I would like to personally \nmake a statement I have I&amp;#39;ve I have   uh overseen presentations like this \nit&amp;#39;s extremely challenging to present   particularly to a lay audience but in such a short \nyou know 15-minute segment and all of you have   done a very nice job of of giving the essence of \nwhat you&amp;#39;re

    "transcript": "[Dr. Ngo] The death of neurons,\ncardiomyocytes and pancreatic beta cells results in the\nclinical symptoms of the disease. The loss of neurons in\nthe brain leads to ataxia, defined as a lack of voluntary\nmuscle control and coordination. Patients experience muscle\nweakness, difficulty walking, and loss of sensation and\nreflexes. The loss of pancreatic beta cells leads to decreased\ninsulin production and the development of diabetes. And\nfinally, the loss of cardiomyocytes in the heart\nleads to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy or the abnormal\nthickening of the heart, which can lead to heart failure.\nAnd this is the most common death for patients with\nFriedreich&amp;#39;s ataxia. [Zheng] Hello there. Welcome back to\nanother episode of Rare Diseases! Rare Disease Review is\na not-for-profit medical journal organized by students from the\nUniversity of Toronto McMaster and Western University. This\npodcast is created by the branch of Western University. The\npodcast aims to advocate for rare disease awareness and\npromote students involvement in the rare disease community. We\nappreciate your listening and support today.

Never\ndisregard professional medical advice or delay in seeking it\nbecause of something you have heard from this podcast. My name\nis Zheng Song, and you&amp;#39;re listening to the Rare Diseases podcast. For\nthis episode, we&amp;#39;re going to dive into a rare hereditary\ndisease called Friedreich&amp;#39;s ataxia. Friedreich&amp;#39;s ataxia is the genetic\nprogressive neurodegenerative movement disorder. The typical\nage of onset is between 10 and 15 years. The initial symptoms\nof Friedreich&amp;#39;s ataxia includes unsteady posture, frequent\nfalling, and progressive difficulty in walking due to\nimpaired ability to coordinate voluntary movement, which is why\nit is called ataxia. The affected individual often\ndevelops slurred speech, called dysarthria, characteristic\nthrough deformities and an irregular curvature of the spine called\nscoliosis. Friedreich&amp;#39;s ataxia is often associated with\ncardiomyopathy, a disease of cardiac muscle that may lead to\nheart failure or irregularities in heart rhythm called cardio-\narrhythmia. People with Friedreich&amp;#39;s ataxia have a higher chance to\nget diabetes. Friedreich&amp;#39;s Ataxia presents degenerative changes in\nsensory nerve fibers at the point where they enter the\nspinal cord in the structure known as dorsal root ganglia,\nwhich results in secondary degeneration of nerve fibers in the spinal\ncord, leading to a deficiency of sensory signals to the\ncerebellum, the part of the brain that helps to coordinate\nvoluntary movements. Friedreich&amp;#39;s ataxia, is caused by a\ntrinucleotide repeat expansion in the FXN gene, which codes for\na protein called frataxin. To better understand the scientific\nresearch on Friedreich&amp;#39;s ataxia, I spoke with Dr. Vy Ngo, a PhD\ngraduate from the Department of Pathology and Laboratory\nMedicine at Western university. Dr. Ngo focused her studies on\nthe cellular molecular mechanism of oxidative\nstress, which in Friedreich&amp;#39;s ataxia is an important\ncontributing factor in the progression of the disease.\nWelcome, Dr. Ngo, it&amp;#39;s our honour to have you with us here\nto speak about Friedreich&amp;#39;s ataxia today. [Dr. Ngo] Thank you so\nmuch for having me. [Zheng] Yes, to start off, can we get to know a\nbit about your work? [Dr. Ngo] Well, I recently completed my PhD in\nPathology and Laboratory mMdicine at Western University.\nAnd my research focused on a protein called Nrf2,\nthe transcriptional master regulator of a cellular\noxidative stress response. So oxidative stress is defined as an imbalance\nbetween the production and accumulation of harmful free\nradicals in cells and tissues and the ability of a biological\nsystem to detoxify these free radicals. Oxidative stress is\nimplicated in a multitude of human diseases, including\nFriedreich&amp;#39;s Ataxia, where it plays a major role in the\nprogression of the disease. [Zheng] Well, that&amp;#39;s very fascinating. I\nwould really love to hear more about your research when you get a\nchance in the future. Now for today, could you give us a\nlittle bit of the insight into the cause of Friedreich&amp;#39;s ataxia?\n[Dr. Ngo] Friedreich&amp;#39;s ataxia is caused by a mutation and the FXN gene on\nchromosome 9 that encodes for a protein called frataxin. It is\nan autosomal recessive disease, meaning an individual must\ninherit 2 abnormal copies of the FXN gene from both parents to\nexpress symptoms of Friedreich&amp;#39;s ataxia. This inherited mutation\ncauses an abnormal repetition of three DNA nucleotides, GAA or\nguanine adenine adenine, known as a trinucleotide repeat\nexpansion. In normal individuals, this GAA sequence\nis repeated approximately 7 to 38 times FXN gene. However, in\nindividuals with Fredericks ataxia, there&amp;#39;s a sequence is\nrepeated anywhere from 66 to over 1700 times. This trial\nnucleotide repeat expansion causes gene silencing in the FXN\ngene, resulting in little or no production of this protoxin\nprotein. [Zheng] That&amp;#39;s really interesting. So frataxin protein\nis being affected in this disease for the patient to\ndevelop Friedreich&amp;#39;s ataxia. What is the role of frataxin? [Dr. Ngo] Frataxin\nis involved in the incorporation of iron into iron-sulphur clusters, which\nserves as various enzyme cofactors including\nmitochondrial enzymes involved in electron transfer and\nultimately mitochondria ATP production. With insufficient\nfrataxin, two (2) key outcomes occur. Firstly, mitochondria are unable\nto incorporate iron into these iron-sulfur clusters, resulting\nin decreased mitochondrial ATP production and insufficient\nenergy for the cell. Secondly, these unused iron accumulates in\nthe cell and reacts with oxygen to form harmful free radicals,\nresulting in oxidative stress over time and ultimately oxidative damage\nif not remedied. This reduction in cellular ATP combined with\noxidative damage results in cell death, specifically in neurons\nand cells of the pancreas and heart, where frataxin is\nnormally most highly expressed. [Zheng] Thank you so much. So with these\nchanges as cellular level, what kind of symptoms and signs are\npatient might present? [Dr. Ngo] The death of neurons, cardiomyocytes, and\npancreatic beta cells results in the clinical symptoms of the\ndisease. The loss of neurons in the brain leads to ataxia,\ndefined as a lack of voluntary muscle control and coordination.\nPatients experience muscle weakness, difficulty walking,\nand loss of sensation and reflexes. The loss of pancreatic\nbeta cells leads to decreased insulin production and the\ndevelopment of diabetes. And finally, the loss of\ncardiomyocytes in the heart leads to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy or the abnormal thickening of the\nheart, which can lead to heart failure. And this is the most\ncommon death for patients with Friedreich&amp;#39;s ataxia. [Zheng] Wow this is very critical\nconditions. So how may a patient be diagnosed and treated?\n[Dr. Ngo] Currently, Friedreich&amp;#39;s ataxia is diagnosed by genetic testing to\nidentify the trinucleotide repeat expansion and both copies\nof the FXN gene in addition to brain images scans, nerve\nconduction studies, blood tests and cardiac tests.\nUnfortunately, at the time there is no cure for Friedreich&amp;#39;s ataxia\nand currently no approved therapies for the treatment of\nthis disease. Treatment is focused on minimizing symptoms\nand maintaining comfort and muscle function. Options for\nthis include physical bracing of limbs, physiotherapy, speech\ntherapy, occupational therapy, corrective skeletal muscle\nsurgery, and medications to treat heart disease and\ndiabetes. And importantly, ongoing research has been\nconducted with hopes of a cure. [Zheng] So with all the wonderful\ninformation you presented here, could you tell us about the\nresearch side of Friedreich&amp;#39;s ataxia and how this is related\nto your research? [Dr. Ngo] As mentioned, Friedreich&amp;#39;s ataxia is a result of\nthe increased production of the protein frataxin, which can\nimpair mitochondrial function and cause oxidative damage. This\noxidative stress induced damage and Friedreich&amp;#39;s ataxia is of\nparticular interest to me, and so I&amp;#39;ll take a moment to discuss\nsome of the current work that is being done in this area. The\nfree radicals, such as those produced in Friedreich&amp;#39;s ataxia,\ncan damage cellular DNA, proteins and lipids,\nresulting in cell death. The cell contains various mechanisms\nto detoxify these free radicals and this is chiefly controlled by\nthe protein transcription factor Nrf2, which I mentioned before.\nNrf2 is responsible for activating the cellular\nantioxidant response. So essentially, Nrf2 means\nless oxidative stress. Small molecules that can activate Nrf2 \nmay have the potential to induce clinical\nbenefits in patients with Friedreich&amp;#39;s ataxia. A 2019 study by Petrillo and\ncolleagues compared different error of two activators for the\ntreatment of Friedrichs ataxia. They found that sulforaphane and\nacetylcysteine were particularly effective on genes involved in\npreventing inflammation and maintaining homeostasis for the antioxidant glutathione and that dimethyl\nfumarate or vatiquinone (EPI-743) were effective in counteracting\ntoxic products accumulation. And finally, that they found\npositive effects of idebenone on mitochondrial protection. Other studies have found similar\nbenefits for Nrf2 activators in improving mitochondrial\nfunction, reducing oxidative stress and inflammation, and\nultimately preventing cell death in the brain, heart, and\npancreas. [Zheng] Well, that&amp;#39;s incredibly\nfascinating. With these great progress in research, what do\nyou think is the direction of future research? [Dr. Ngo] Collectively, this suggests that\nthe development of synergistic therapies based on a combination\nof Nrf2 activators may have therapeutic benefits to patients\nwith Friedreich&amp;#39;s ataxia. Such research is currently ongoing\nand in addition to reducing oxidative stress and improving\nmitochondrial function, other areas of Friedreich&amp;#39;s ataxia\ntreatment research include modulation of frataxin-\ncontrolled metabolic pathways; frataxin replacement,\nstabilizers and enhancers; methods to increase FXN gene\nexpression; and gene replacement and gene\nediting therapies as outlined by the Friedreich&amp;#39;s Ataxia Research\nAlignment Alliance (FARA) [Zheng] That&amp;#39;s great. Thank you so much\nfor joining us today Dr. Ngo, and thank you so much for the\ninformative interview. I&amp;#39;m grateful for your time and the\namazing research you have shared. You have provided a\ngreat contribution to advancing the science of pathology and\nmedicine, and we&amp;#39;re really honored to learn from you today.\n[Dr. Ngo] Thank you so much.",

    "transcript": "[Music] hi everyone welcome to my youtube channel today is a video i&amp;#39;ve been wanting to film for a very very long time but um i just feel like i&amp;#39;m finally in the place where i can share it and talk about it with you guys um i&amp;#39;m really nervous to tell my story but i&amp;#39;m also equally as excited to hopefully raise awareness and teach people um about fa so without further ado let&amp;#39;s get into my story so i&amp;#39;ll start out from the beginning i have been a clumsy child my entire life you can ask anyone in my family i was always falling and i always landed like straight on my mouth if i look back at all of my old photos i always have a busted lip um i never really thought anything of it i just i wasn&amp;#39;t athletic i wasn&amp;#39;t graceful i guess it&amp;#39;s the word um my entire life and that was kind of the label i gave myself was clumsy and um i kind of used it as a reason why everything was happening and i never thought anything of it like i just thought i was the clumsiest person i&amp;#39;d ever met um i got into high school and about my junior year i really started to be off balance and uncoordinated i was made fun of her how i walked i kind of just became the joke sort of not not in a bad way not in a bullying way but like oh medicine can&amp;#39;t walk don&amp;#39;t let madison carry that you know and again i was just like ugh i&amp;#39;m so clumsy my senior year i could not walk down the hall without either holding on to a friend or um leaning against the wall i would if i was alone walking down the hallway i would walk against the wall because i just wasn&amp;#39;t stable enough to do it on my own and i can look back at all of this now and see how it was kind of obvious but again at the time i had no idea what friedrichs ataxia was and so i remember when at my graduation my biggest fear i didn&amp;#39;t even care about graduating like i did not want to fall walking the stage and i did not wear heels they wouldn&amp;#39;t let us wear sneakers which is what i feel most comfortable in but um i wore sandals and i kind of stumbled like right when i got up there and then i was like and i took a deep breath and i i kind of just didn&amp;#39;t let myself think i just wanted to get across the stage so thankfully it didn&amp;#39;t fall then but um summer after my senior year so right after i graduated high school i went to washington state um my ex-boyfriend now but back then i was going on a trip to see him for two weeks and we went hiking i almost fell off the mountain it was so terrifying i was slipping everywhere i was just so uncoordinated and unbalanced and throughout the whole trail and um we went back and i kind of tried to put it behind me but um his mom is a physical therapist and she kind of saw the whole time i was there it was really difficult for me to go downstairs to just walk in general is getting really difficult and um she is the one that oh hi she&amp;#39;s the one that kind of helped me you know maybe you should distract out maybe you should go see if there&amp;#39;s something going on and so i went home and i i had like a yearly checkup uh coming up like that next week or something and i decided i was going to tell him about my balance issues and that&amp;#39;s just kind of how it all started um i told him about my worries about my balance and stuff and he was like because when he sees me i&amp;#39;m just sitting i&amp;#39;m not walking really and um he had me do all these balance tests like touch my nose all that stuff and um follow his eyes touch his finger and then he had me walk for him and i failed all of the balance test and he was very concerned and so i went and got an mri that day remember being terrified um it was very scary and uh they actually called me back and said they wanted another mri said that they thought my spinal cord was really narrow back at the time and um that of course worried me and my parents i got a second mri done so it was august 2019 and i was living alone in round rock starting college just like trying to live my life and be normal even though i kind of had this you know just constant fear in the back of my mind like what is wrong with me so i went and saw my neurologist and he kind of diagnosed me with ataxia just ataxia then um so that&amp;#39;s like issues with my gait like how i walk and stuff like it&amp;#39;s kind of like this is awful maybe i&amp;#39;ll walk for you at the end of this video so at first he wanted to do all of these tests to see if it was a vitamin deficiency something else with my blood so i had all this blood work done and i was kind of praying that&amp;#39;s what it was because if it was because of a vitamin deficiency i could just take a supplement i could take medicine and help it out but of course my blood came back completely normal all the results were negative um and so he was like the next step is genetic testing [Music] to see if your disorder is genetic and it was like right when kovet hit like march april and so we had a virtual meeting with my geneticist and she like stalked me and told me that she was going to test for all these different types of ataxia to see what mine was and and i think it was two weeks later i had my blood work done again but this was genetic testing and so they like sent it off to the lab or whatever and it took about four or six weeks or something but it was june when she called me and i was alone in my apartment in round rock and she told me i had friedrichs ataxia she said that this is a rare disorder but the type of ataxia i have is the most common um it occurs in one in fifty thousand people it&amp;#39;s genetic and there&amp;#39;s no cure um it was really hard to hear and i was alone and i just prayed to god and i was like why we are not getting emotional so um that was really hard it was um so i did what any person would do right after she hung up with me i googled it do not google it um i just saw that within 10 to 20 years you&amp;#39;d be in a wheelchair um the mortality rate it&amp;#39;s kind of the worst facts and anyway later on she had me meet with her in person and she talked to me and told me all about fa and stuff it&amp;#39;s a progressive disorder that is genetic so both of my pain i&amp;#39;ll do this in the most simple way i can but um we all have a gene called frutaxin and my parents have like a mutated gene both of them it takes both of them to have it so they both had a mutated gene and if they both have it there&amp;#39;s one in four chances that their children can have it and i have it so um i pray to god every day that my siblings don&amp;#39;t have it and they never will neither of them are symptomatic and they don&amp;#39;t really want you to get genetic testing until you&amp;#39;re 18. um if you&amp;#39;re not symptomatic friedrich&amp;#39;s ataxia is a neurological disorder that affects my balance coordination my speech my heart um my muscles things like that it doesn&amp;#39;t affect me cognitively like i can think and reason and praise god for that but um it&amp;#39;s progressive so as time goes on my nerves in my arms and legs will slowly degenerate and stop working and pretty much um it gets harder every day i&amp;#39;m not gonna lie to walk and be balanced and but i&amp;#39;m going to keep fighting it and i&amp;#39;m not going to give up i work out every single day because that is the best thing you can do to keep yourself strong physical therapy and occupational therapy have completely changed my life they&amp;#39;ve made me feel so strong they&amp;#39;ve done nothing but be there for me i love my therapist with like their family and um they&amp;#39;ve kind of just been with me throughout this whole thing um it&amp;#39;s now february of 2021 and so i&amp;#39;ve been going there for like a year or so so after i was officially diagnosed with the fa i was set up with a team i&amp;#39;m so thankful i had the best doctor ever he set me up with a cardiologist a heart doctor and a ophthalmologist which is an eye doctor and of course my neurologist and then him as my primary care and i see all of them hopefully just once a year for a checkup to keep everything in check because um i am high risk for cardiomyopathy i think as i say which is like thickening of the heart muscle and so i get that monitored every six months i avoided my diagnosis for a very long time i only told of course my family and my very close friends but i didn&amp;#39;t want people to treat me differently or i don&amp;#39;t know i just i still wanted to be just madison before my diagnosis because it&amp;#39;s not who i am well i got diagnosed in june and i finally made the decision to share my story on social media i think it was right after christmas yeah so december june 2 december i didn&amp;#39;t really tell anyone um i really didn&amp;#39;t let myself accept it i went through a hell of a lot of stuff um in 2020 uh right after i got my diagnosis i went through a breakup i um failed out of my sonography program i and so i was trying to cope with all of that while also trying to accept that i now have a rare disease and it just really didn&amp;#39;t work out the best for me i struggled a lot a lot a lot in 2020 but um i started going to emotional therapy highly recommend and i have gotten so much better just learning how to cope with everything i&amp;#39;ve been through and also coping daily with having fa i have never been in a better place than i am right now i know it&amp;#39;s hard after everything i&amp;#39;ve just shared to say that but i am i am so happy so flash forward to now um it&amp;#39;s february 2021 i have gone to therapy i&amp;#39;m continuing to do physical and occupational therapy once a week just to hold me accountable and keep me strong i have moved home with my parents i feel a lot safer here um if i fell or if something happened i&amp;#39;m happier being surrounded by my family every single day it means the world to me i&amp;#39;m super happy to have my dogs um you&amp;#39;ll sleep with me every night and i&amp;#39;m also very happy because i have made friends with fa sharing my story i cannot tell you how comforting it is to know that you are not alone because i thought i was alone for six months um maybe even longer than that before i got officially diagnosed i i really thought i was alone and sharing my story i have met some of the greatest people i met i&amp;#39;ve met them virtually i&amp;#39;ve not met them in person i hope one day i can but they&amp;#39;re so kind and motivating and they inspire me every day to keep going i&amp;#39;m doing online school i am a psychology major now uh much less of a physical challenge and um more of a mental one um i love it so so much my plans are to one day be a therapist and just help people in general with whatever they&amp;#39;re dealing with because i now know from experience how crippling anxiety and depression can be and i&amp;#39;ve overcame that and i want to help other people learn to cope in healthy ways like my therapist help me i&amp;#39;m so grateful i know it wasn&amp;#39;t my plan that i had for myself but i do truly believe that this is god&amp;#39;s plan for me and i&amp;#39;m going to try the best to fulfill my purpose and help other people the best i can um and live a happier life as well as raise awareness for free drugs with ataxia so i can help people find a cure because fa is just a part of me it doesn&amp;#39;t define me and who i am um so yeah i&amp;#39;m so thankful for each of you that clicked on this video i&amp;#39;m gonna leave information about fa down below so if you want to educate yourself more about it and you know learn what you can do to help i will leave those down below thank you guys for watching i&amp;#39;m sure it was kind of all over the place i didn&amp;#39;t really have a set plan for how i was gonna tell the story and i hope i didn&amp;#39;t leave anything out too important this was such a big season of change and so it&amp;#39;s like i want to remember this and so i picked up the camera and this will be my fourth video i&amp;#39;m hoping to post it on rare disease day um it&amp;#39;ll be my first rare disease day where i knew i had a rare disease i hope you enjoyed this video if you liked it don&amp;#39;t forget to leave a like leave a comment and subscribe all of my videos won&amp;#39;t be this deep that&amp;#39;s it enzo you have anything to say thank y&amp;#39;all for watching bye",

    "transcript": "hi everybody i&amp;#39;m adriana ellis and i&amp;#39;m excited to share with you what i learned about friedrichs ataxia so to start off this this disorder is typically diagnosed before the age of 15 so some symptoms include ataxia which is a lack of coordination dysarthria a slow or slurred speech poor balance difficulty swallowing decreased gross and fine motor skills and cardiomyopathy and as of right now there is no cure and it&amp;#39;s a lifelong disease so let&amp;#39;s start off with a video to show what it&amp;#39;s like for someone living with friedrich ataxia [Music] so [Music] so [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] all right so i chose this video because it showed a little bit about how frederick&amp;#39;s ataxia really impacted his life and his activities of daily living so let&amp;#39;s talk about the etiology so what&amp;#39;s the cause of frederick&amp;#39;s ataxia so ferguson atexia is an inherited recessive allele on the gene fxn which causes the production of frataxin frataxin is a protein that helps the mitochondria function and as you all know the mitochondria is responsible for producing energy for cells and cells that use a lot of energy a lot of energy that the mitochondria produces are nerve cells and heart cells that&amp;#39;s why people with friedreich&amp;#39;s ataxia have these symptoms related to um lack of coordination [Music] um just nerve cells dying and then heart cells so like the cardiomyopathy and um so the the dyeing nerve cells lead to a lack of sensation which also often starts in the legs and that is why typically they need people with freedom&amp;#39;s ataxia need wheelchairs um poor gait and balance and an idea that i thought of to show kind of like how poor gain and get imbalance would affect your life is if you just get like a high heel or like a shoe and you put it on just one of your feet and you try to walk and then you notice how difficult it is and how it could really impact your life um so that kind of shows a little bit of how and if you like run it&amp;#39;s obviously like really like impacts like how you walk and like your balance and stuff so and it also leads to hearing and vision loss dysarthria so the slowed or slurred speech and difficulty swallowing and then so the heart cells dying can lead to heart palpitations arrhythmias and then the cardiomyopathy and then some more diseases that are typically associated with friedreich&amp;#39;s ataxia are diabetes scoliosis and then foot deformities so frederick detective ataxia is pretty rare it occurs in one in five fifty thousand people worldwide that&amp;#39;s point zero zero two percent of the population and is typically diagnosed before the age of 15 as i said um it worsens over time and within 10 years most people need a wheelchair and or like a walker to ambulate and then it shortens the lifespan some people are known to live for up to 70 years but it does typically shorten the lifespan and then some related disorders are ataxia with vitamin e deficiency and this is different because if you take a vitamin e supplement your symptoms don&amp;#39;t progress as worse as with friedrichs ataxia and then there&amp;#39;s also spinal cerebral ataxia with axonal neuropathy and these are due to mutations in the tdp-1 gene and both of these are both recessive alleles so they are also quite rare so then risk factors as i said if both if both parents carry the recessive gene then there&amp;#39;s a 25 chance so as seen on this punnett square this is a recessive this is a recessive and so you have a 25 chance if one parent has both recessive alleles then there&amp;#39;s a 50 chance of getting the disease and then medical management so physical therapy speech therapy surgery surgery for musculoskeletal issues such as scoliosis or the foot deformities and then braces can help as shown in the video and there&amp;#39;s treatments for the other conditions like diabetes too and so this is a little bit about how occupational therapy can help i looked at the domain and the the aoda framework and look through some of the adls so you can tell like in the video brushing his teeth was difficult due to the lack of coordination eating may be difficult due to swallowing difficulty swallowing and then walking with the gait imbalance and leisure so some other occupations they won&amp;#39;t be able to do like if they had done it before like fishing and such if they need to use their balance and coordination it might be more difficult um and then play so most people are diagnosed when they are children so this will impact the way that they play with others and then social participation this will impact as shown in the video he wanted to go roller skating and he was able to but it may impact his social participation in that way so then some related precautions just with transferring and wheelchairs or ambulating sorry um so people use wheelchairs walkers canes such a you know such like that and then they may need routine checkups for their diabetes or their heart issues like cardiomyopathy and then here are my references and then we&amp;#39;re gonna do a mini jeopardy interactive piece hi everybody so this is julia and chris her fiance here to help me out with mini jeopardy so let&amp;#39;s start off with julia which one which category would you like to choose let&amp;#39;s do miscellaneous for 200. all right most people with frederick&amp;#39;s ataxia are diagnosed by this age chris what is 15 that is correct it&amp;#39;s 15. go ahead let&amp;#39;s go with etiology 400. all right this trinucleotide repeat decreases the production of frataxin julia what is the gaa trinuclean trinucleotide repeat yes the gaa trinucleotide repeat produces protection or decreases the production of protection sorry go ahead choose category let&amp;#39;s do cathedral physiology for 400. all right lack of sensation often starts in this part of the body and those with who have frederick&amp;#39;s ataxia chris what is the lower extremity that&amp;#39;s true it starts in the lower extremity all right let&amp;#39;s go with miscellaneous for 400. so i gotta give you your points all right this profession can help those with frederick&amp;#39;s ataxia by helping them with balance and coordination julia what is occupational therapy that&amp;#39;s true you get 400 points go ahead next category etiology for 200. this protein is coded by the fxn gene chris what is frataxin that&amp;#39;s right go ahead let&amp;#39;s finish it off here with pathophysiology at 200. this heart condition is common for people who have friedreich&amp;#39;s ataxia julia what is cardiomyopathy yep that&amp;#39;s true all right this so the final score is 1 800. final question this is a percentage of people that have frederick&amp;#39;s ataxia worldwide go ahead 0.002 that&amp;#39;s true chris wins whoo you get 500 points for the last one all right thank you guys i hope you learned a little bit about frederick&amp;#39;s ataxia",

please I would like to thank for the invitation we wish you good fruitful conference I am here as a coordinator from the European Council for sectional children&amp;#39;s abuse to sensitizing make people aware with all the tools that we have from the European Parliament so that we can meet the children all the golden rules that the European countries talk to them about their body all the related issues and now we have a new cartoon story where the protagonist is on a wheelchair so that we can protect the more vulnerable children our aim is to stand by them listen to them so that they know how they can avoid the situation that may lead them to a difficult situation but make parents aware to be careful with the emotions of our children you know a villain in sexual abuse comes from the family environment of the child who knows the person or trusts and perhaps we know this person one out of five if children in Europe we have sexual abuse in Greece which is 16 and only two out of a hundred children break their silence because their feelings are mixed the person that they love and to carry on we through the informative tools to try to urge children to speak but at the same time the state has a national election plan with the initiative of the Prime Minister which is for the protection of children&amp;#39;s sexual abuse and for this action plan 11 Ministries cooperate so that we can restructure the institutional operations become 10 children friendly and help towards this Direction with the thought that the informed children are safe we continue the sensitization and awareness campaign I will leave the informative material so that it can reach all children and I will be here to stand by in your efforts as a member of Parliament and at the same time in any other field that may be necessary thank you very much for your attention it&amp;#39;s time to go to the second panel to talk about the clinical research and Innovative treatment I&amp;#39;m very glad that we have we women have uh um and it is proved by all of you that you are here and every day at the place of your work the next coordinator which is evangelia headed the hematological clinic hospitals and associate professor at the Washington Seattle University she set up the program in the hospital she spend some time into transplant with the patients treatments [Music] you have the floor thank you very much I am glad that I welcome you into this session which I think we all expect since it mentions to the innovative uh but actually it is a great honor to chair this session I would like to thank Mr karachias for this honorary invitation to help thank him also for the ability that he gives me to get to know the disease I only remember it from my students here and his Devotion to the disease and the effort for treatment the mobilized me as well as a scientist that has to do with a gene treatment and from now on we are planning without the researchers in Thessaloniki to be able to approach from our side the gene therapy for this disease in English [Music] we have a distinguished speaker with us uh Dr Mirella erotica yes Dr christophany and Dr Amanda George [Music] um Dr Tory uh Mandy sent uh Sophie will be uh joined will join us virtually Dr rodic is with us here um and um I would like without any further delay to start I will start thank you okay um I was um I was switched to Brick now uh I will start basically for Genie treatment in order to understand accordions to understand what we are going to hear later on ataxia but what we call rare diseases and how rare are they reality rare disease is characterized by the is considered that 60 people in the United States 15 Europe 75 in China per 100 000 people right these are chronic diseases many times difficult which can affect every system in the human body however for the rare diseases the interesting thing from from research groups is not particularly high as you really understand therefore for more rare diseases in reality they represent and non fulfilled medical media rare disease perhaps the term is it not this disorienting if we consider that more than 7 000 rare diseases are that affect the over 400 million people all over the world and these numbers are increasing since new rare diseases are recognized and characterized the gene therapy theoretically could correct any Gene disease and the proof of concept has shown that with a dream treatment we can have results the term for Gene treatment is that we are talking about a biological product which comprises from a combined DNA and it is used in the human events in order to correct to replace to other or to eliminate them a genetic a mutation or not depending on the target where the final Target is to treat or to address diseases gen genetical problems the gene treatment is a new medical practice it is as regards to basic access is that compatible medicine acts by changing the phenotype a patient has to have the equipment by received agenda and certain exogenously and also chemotherapy however creates a many problems on the other hand the gene treatment is a holistic way of addressing the problem since it targets the root of the disease that uh there is a mutated it can be transferred to the cell and they said ideally come down with a gene correction in C2 or alternatively with Gene addition then the underlying disease can be corrected the other side which shows that the real in reality Gene treatment is a new medical practice is the fact that the new era in the treatment where we have been in has changed the traditional model of the drugs which is not produced massively standardized but the raw material derives from the patient and the end product ends up to the patient it&amp;#39;s a customized treatment and it is not a drug that is going to be metabolized we are talking about live cells for and may remain there for the rest of the people&amp;#39;s life that&amp;#39;s why we are talking about live drugs therefore it is a new medical practice at this point we have to point out that the change that means only in somatic cells and not in a reproducts in cells we don&amp;#39;t want to create uh generally generations of mutated people only in the issue that it has a problem in order to create a phenotype and not to corrupt to correct a natural how does it work the gene treatment it works is based on viruses that become inactive takes place by removing the structural elements of the virus and in their place we have the natural genetics this is a natural dream is foreign but also to have the expression of the virus in the long term otherwise it will remain [Music] but that does not guarantees the expression how is he delivered either was used the treatment is used when it is easily accessible the cells as you can see here is used when the target cells are not easily accessible like the lungs liver foreign foreign um and here we have another example of Hemophilia other genetic treatment very simple procedure for the patient the viral vector is used immediately in these cases we use a stereotypes of the viruses that show tropism towards everything targeted tissue there are two basic ways the traditional the classical type of genetic treatment addition of the gene in the Target cell using some viral vectors the viral Vector is going to be incorporated and inserted remains with a mutated Gene but the protein that is generated produced is normal the technology of genetic processing has been advanced in recent years and in this way we can Target the English side we use some nucleus is specific for the targeted side these nucleus is that the act as a molecular scissors and with the nucleosis in the guide molecule that later to the Target point target decided we have the correction of this mutation the differences of these two approaches are that the target side is critical here is not predictable another way you have a genetic treatment is a combination with the Democratic cells technology and we have the possibility to reprogram them by putting them in a culture with a cocktail of a transcriptional age and it says so we get them into a naval developmental stage and in this state we have two choices to have a genetic processing to correct the genetic relation the genetic damage so to have an enriched population of the genetic cells have to be transplanted and the other um well it is at this stage to have a differentiation of these cells the abnormal Gene so we have and then reach the cell the rich population of the disease the cells and with the old 3D cultures and choose new drugs foreign [Music] the specificity of a cell 40 years have gone by since the beginning of genetic treatment and nowadays we have excellent clinical results and outcomes and many drugs for rare diseases that have been approved by the various institutions and the genetic treatments and nowadays we have many success stories in a variety of diseases we can see 500 the ones that we have approved products and I confused by saying that as a president of the association of genetic treatment and their electorality of medicine we support the research for rare diseases you can see that in the program of having the agenda of our conference on the 27th of May 28th for me and we are all invited to participate foreign speaker she&amp;#39;s a doctor doctor she&amp;#39;s an um associate professor and principal fellow in Imagine Institute she leads the research group on mitochondrial diseases oh sorry I apologize sorry for that um so um a principal research fellow at the law of Russia medical research institute at the University of warlock in Australia and her research focuses um in human stem cells to develop models for studying the nervous system and also to develop therapists for neurodegenerative diseases and in particular future Academia so um the stage is yours thank you very much I&amp;#39;ll just share my screen and please be a moment sorry can you see that okay okay so firstly I would like to thank um the it&amp;#39;s um the it&amp;#39;s the possibility to speak today this um meeting I&amp;#39;m sorry I um can&amp;#39;t speak Greek I really wish I could but um yeah thank you very much it&amp;#39;s a great honor to be presenting at this meeting so with this brief talk I&amp;#39;m really going to be speaking mainly about in the overview of the research Direction our lab is taking in terms of for um Fredericks ataxia and so sorry I will just move on so when we think about different therapies for um fa the ideal scenario obviously is to basically correct the mutation because that is the the critical thing causing it is that GAA expansion and obviously the uh new technologies moving forward with this in um in particular in crispr Technologies the other approach is obviously to deliver for a toxin and there are our group and other groups around the world working on this as well in particular looking at different Delivery Systems and it could be using a viral approach as we&amp;#39;ve just heard before from um and Validia um introduce that really well as well as obviously nanoparticles the next level approach is to then potentially promote cellular Health in particular their cells that are degenerating or to prevent further degeneration and progression of the disease and a lot of these approaches in therapies are looking at in particular antioxidants or other compounds that may endogenously increase protection levels and finally there is also the possibility potentially for some tissues for tissue replacement and in that case would be transplantation the reason that I&amp;#39;m highlighting all of these approaches is just to show you that stem cells can feed into each of these because stem cells offers a really useful platform to test these different therapeutic Avenues in a more High throughput system before you go into the human and patients so when again to this audience my apologies how I&amp;#39;m pitching at some they have a great understanding of stem cells and others that may be new but I thought to sort of go back to some of the basics so really when we Define a stem cell obviously it&amp;#39;s a cell that can proliferate to give rise to cell and also a cell that can proliferate to give rise to a specialized cell and relevant to that tissue now there&amp;#39;s many different types of stem cells in the body those that give rise to the hemopridic system the bone marrow and and so forth but the ones that we work in the lab are these induced pluripotent stem cells and these stem cells are actually artificially created even though they&amp;#39;re derived from Human tissue or in patient cases so this was technology that was developed around 2006 by professor shinya yamanak in Japan and there was also other groups involved in the US and he got a Nobel Prize for this work in 2012 because it really was a game changer for modern medicine mainly for disease modeling so very briefly and again I could although I don&amp;#39;t understand Greek I could see the slides before that you already introduced this concept but the technology behind this is that essentially can take human tissue usually we use skin cells it can use even fat cells or blood cells and introduce four or five different genes or proteins in the past we used to use viruses but now there&amp;#39;s many other approaches that essentially these four or five proteins the combination of them converts we say reprograms these skin cells to become into a pluripotent state so this word pluriponent means that these cells have the capability to give rise to all cell types of the body and essentially they&amp;#39;re mimicking embryonic stem cells that you find in a particular stage of the blastocyst which would give rise to the um to the baby or the the whole human body so once they&amp;#39;re in a pluripotence state then in the dish we can then drive them into different cell types of of the body that we may be interested in and you can appreciate this technology is really powerful because we can do a lot with these cells we can genetically edit them to either correct the mutations we can introduce new mutations to understand the disease obviously use different cell types for drug screening screening and for some diseases in some scenarios you can transplant them back into the patient as they&amp;#39;re moving forward for Parkinson&amp;#39;s Disease so when this technology came about our group and also other groups around the world um quickly moved forward into this technology to develop Fredericks Ataxia ipsl lines so in our lab alone we&amp;#39;ve got about at least 13 different Fredericks attack system cell lines and obviously there&amp;#39;s other stem cell lines around the world and the main lineages that we&amp;#39;re focused in working on and this is also with other collaborations in Australia is the main tissues main cell types affected in fa so that&amp;#39;s the cardiomyocytes relevant to the heart tissue then we&amp;#39;ve got all the different brain cell types in particular the cerebellar um um neurons and then in my lab in particular we&amp;#39;re primarily interested in the dorsary ganglia Sensory neurons so this is where the proprioceptor neurons are found the which are the neurons are sensory neurons that are innervating the muscle that are sensing feeling and it&amp;#39;s these neurons as well as this um cerebellar neurons that are one of the primary sites of degeneration that begins in FA so this is just to show you you know the basic concept where you can essentially go from skin to stem cells to neurons and these neurons that you end up in the dish essentially have the same genetic background of where they came from so it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s almost like the same cell type that&amp;#39;s converted to different stages and um and different different properties so why use stem cells for screening well obviously there&amp;#39;s you know a lot of value but one of the main things to highlight is that one same that one cell lineage you&amp;#39;re working with you can differentiate into the multiple lineages so you can have the cardiomycytes you can have cerebellar neurons you can have the door through ganglia Sensory neurons so you have a really nice platform looking at different cell types but again with the same genetic basis and and other properties obviously because it&amp;#39;s an ongoing resource you can make multiple patient lines with varying genetic backgrounds different GAA repeats and different um phenotypes you would say reflecting different disease progression and obviously they&amp;#39;re quite a valuable resource for high throughput you know screens with different Therapies so for this talk I&amp;#39;m just going to give again a very basic overview how we&amp;#39;re using stem cells to look at differential Gene Delivery Systems for delivering protection to the body so again it was it was really presented very well in the previous slides as I could see from from um from what I saw that gene therapy is very much an umbrella word for meaning many different types of approaches it can be X fever where you genetically manipulate the cells and then transplant those cells into the body or can be directly in Viva where you actually use viruses or nanoparticles to deliver the gene into different Target tissues now of this as you can imagine like all Technologies the many different parts that you need to work on at the same time to get it all right and with gene therapy one of the main things to get right is actually the delivery system so how you&amp;#39;re going to deliver for a tax and then there&amp;#39;s other issues as well on how much ritaxin to give and how to actually deliver for a tax and to the right cell type and also into the mitochondria now we&amp;#39;re quite fortunate in our lab that we&amp;#39;ve been funded both from Farah USA and also from the Australian government to look at diff a multi-prong approach different Delivery Systems in particular the nanoparticles or using Associated adenoviruses or viruses so with um no matter which approach you take whether it&amp;#39;s nanoparticles or viruses or different types of viruses the key thing about the delivery system to appreciate is that every cell in the body has its unique signature and will only allow certain things in and others it won&amp;#39;t allow in and so when you&amp;#39;re trying to develop a delivery system you have to think well what will preferentially deliver this gene into this cell type and not others so what is particular about the particular nerve cell and there&amp;#39;s so many different types of nerve cells with all different properties which will allow for taxon to get into this particular nerve but avoid the liver for example so this is where again stem cells offers a really good platform to screen for these sorts of things so with the case of looking at nanoparticles so we collaborate with the group from University of Melbourne Professor Frank Caruso he&amp;#39;s a bioengineer and Dr Christina Cortez Hugo and we&amp;#39;ve been um this is a pharaoh funded project both USA and Australia and where we&amp;#39;ve been using basically um these stem cells or sensory neurons to screen different nanoparticles but the things that I&amp;#39;d really I&amp;#39;m not going to show data but I just want you to appreciate the concepts behind this so nanoparticles are usually engineered um constructs but they can be also naturally occurring and there&amp;#39;s many different types of materials that can be used in the nanoparticles so you ones that we&amp;#39;re particularly looked at are silica based nanoparticles even gold nanoparticles or you may be familiar with the lipid nanoparticles which where the covert vaccine was used to deliver the MRNA there&amp;#39;s also different ways in which you can assemble the nanoparticle itself so it&amp;#39;s not just the particle but different approaches we&amp;#39;ve looked at was saying layer by layer so the core of the particles there was silica but the external part of the composition of the nanoparticles was a different sort of material which may again allow better accessibility to certain cells then you can have different nanoparticle sizes as well as the extracellular features which are charged and then as I mentioned you can also have naturally occurring nanoparticles so every example we looked at glycogen which is a natural metabolite that your body makes and some of these natural metabolites you can also engineer and modify in order to attach say the DNA of Interest the gene or the MRNA so that it can get into enter into the cell and the strong advantage of nanoparticles is that it&amp;#39;s not just about delivering DNA obviously they can be used to deliver mRNA again thinking about the covert vaccine they can also be modified to deliver proteins or particular drugs so the bottom line with nanoparticles is that they give us the greatest flexibility for screening to look at different components to deliver for attacks into different tissues however because it&amp;#39;s a double-edged sword because you&amp;#39;ve got all those different variations the screening takes longer so over the years we&amp;#39;ve been working with as I said these bioengineers and looking at different nanoparticle types different nanoparticle sizes charges particle densities the way they&amp;#39;re assembled and we&amp;#39;ve been using our Sensory neurons derived from fa patients as a platform we&amp;#39;ve been controlling them in 3D in 2D to screen the the various types and we&amp;#39;ve obtained some quite promising results with different compounds like silica based small nanoparticles and glycogen and then however I would like to flag that also when we then go to the in Vivo model when we test these in say animals we see sometimes quite different results so what we may see in the dish doesn&amp;#39;t always necessarily translate to what we see in Vivo and that makes sense because in the body you&amp;#39;ve got the immune system you&amp;#39;ve got even in the nervous system you&amp;#39;ve got glia that can soak up different things so that&amp;#39;s okay because that&amp;#39;s the approach we take so we do all our screening in this in in our stem cell based cell types then we go to a new Vivo if it doesn&amp;#39;t work we go back to our platform and look at and stream the next candidates so just because it doesn&amp;#39;t always translate it&amp;#39;s not necessarily A Bad Thing it actually validates the purpose of having a an in vitro screening platform to Fast Track This to then choose the top candidates for the in Vivo scenario for the annual studies so the second approach as I mentioned is looking at viruses in particular the adenoviruses this is work that was very recently funded um only last year so again it&amp;#39;s still early days and I&amp;#39;m just going to highlight um the con the approach that we&amp;#39;re taking um so basically there&amp;#39;s three main aims and this is uh quite a large-scale project um involving many collaborators across Australia and a lot of different expertise and I myself don&amp;#39;t have expertise in um in adenoviruses but we&amp;#39;re collaborating with them Dr Le Sheckler whiskey from University of Sydney who&amp;#39;s our you know virus Guru who advise us on everything so again with adenoviruses there are many that have been used in clinical trials at the moment but those of you who are familiar with this technology are aware that as with these aavs there&amp;#39;s many different types and they definitely have different preference into which different tissues they can Target so with our collaborators what we&amp;#39;re doing is we have these different libraries and kits so we&amp;#39;re screening one is an aab testing kit so in this kit there&amp;#39;s at least 70 different aavs which are at the moment available some are being used in clinical trials and some are being used in the lab and we&amp;#39;re using those to screen our different stem cell platforms to see which one&amp;#39;s preferentially get into the cell in parallel we&amp;#39;re also screening libraries of bioengineered aav so these have been randomly mutated in different ways particularly at the Casper that is the external part of the virus that determines where it how it transfects into what cells it transfects into and we&amp;#39;re using the same cells as the screening platform now both the kits and these libraries have been barcoded so they&amp;#39;ve been genetically modified so like when you go to the supermarket and you go through the screening and every product has its barcode so the idea is that we transduce infect ourselves with these different libraries and the ones in which and they&amp;#39;re carrying a gfp protein a green fluorescent protein and the ones which show to be efficiently infecting the cells we&amp;#39;re able to isolate by fact sorting sequence it and then um and then identify which particular adenovirus type whether it&amp;#39;s by an engineered one or one that&amp;#39;s available was preferential in efficient in transfecting that cell type this will take two or three rounds but we from there we will get our top candidates as I mentioned the main platforms that we&amp;#39;re using is the cardiomyocyte so this is in collaboration with um Dr Max Lim from Saint Vincent&amp;#39;s Institute in Melbourne and he has beautiful models of using using the same stem cell lines as we have in making cardiac organoids so these are tissue-like structures that are mimicking the cardiac you also can introduce vascular cells and and neural cells into there and has beautiful functional assays to measure activity the other collaborators with Dr Sam Naylor from Queensland in Australia and he has developed the technology to make cerebellar organoids so as you know in FA the main region of the brain mainly affected is the dentate nuclear nucleus within the cerebellum so Sam has been able to derive these cell types from these stem cells and make them into these little organoid-like structures and what&amp;#39;s nice is that in his um organoids he has identified quite a large proportion of the relevant nuclei that neurons that we&amp;#39;re interested in which is the Deep cerebellar nuclei and then in my lab we&amp;#39;re interested as I mentioned is in the dorsa ganglia Sensory neurons and again I don&amp;#39;t have time to go into all this data but there are different types of the one sensing pain the one sensing skin but touch and feeling and the others are the proprioceptors that innervate the muscle and we over the years have developed a lot of protocols and expertise in deriving these cell types in the dish and also just to highlight that it&amp;#39;s not just about getting these Sensory neurons as a whole we&amp;#39;re also really gearing in and we&amp;#39;ve just recently we&amp;#39;re fortunate to get funding from thara to look at this steeper where we&amp;#39;re able to derive a more pure population particularly of these proprio sensing Sensory neurons again these are the large Sensory neurons that are innervating the muscle that are one of the primary neurons that um that are degenerating so we&amp;#39;re using these cell types in in our screens and this is again preliminary data but just to show you um that again in our Pro initially we&amp;#39;re doing these screens as I mentioned with the green fluorescent protein because we need this to be high throughput to extract it through um through identifying the appropriate cells that have been infected so that we can isolate them and sequence them and we&amp;#39;re getting um interesting results you know some are consistent some are different across the different cell types and different platforms and then once we&amp;#39;ve chosen our top say you know three to five candles there&amp;#39;s still more work to be done so there&amp;#39;s the the second part is to look at the dosing of the virus again to verify the efficiency of transfecting that cell type also a virus may be great in you know infecting the cell but it may not be ideal for manufacturing purpose and that&amp;#39;s where we give it to our collaborators in Sydney and they&amp;#39;ve got a lot of experience in in this area we also in the dish can um see how well or poorly these cells interact with antibodies within the within the immune system because obviously we don&amp;#39;t want an immune reaction so we can help avoid that by screening for that in the dish and one of the main parts of the same as well is to specifically look at the liver because the liver is an organ that mops up a lot of things that you ingest in particular viruses as well as nanoparticles so we collaborate with another group again from University of Melbourne who has Works in liver cancer and there&amp;#39;s a lot of expertise in making liver organoids and from patient cells so once we&amp;#39;ve derived our top candidates we will screen these aavs in these liver organoids to see the ones that do not actually infect the liver so it&amp;#39;s a negative screen and then finally once we get through that part obviously it&amp;#39;s all about protaxin and so that&amp;#39;s we will choose our top candidates introduce for taxon into the candidate top um aavs and then perform similar studies in our stem cell models and going much deeper obviously looking at mitochondrial outcomes and also functional outcomes and we have a quite a bit of expertise in that area to look at that and just to wind it all up the things that we really are facing now as we&amp;#39;re entering in this work um in particular gene therapy is and again many of you may already appreciate that it&amp;#39;s not just about delivering for a taxi but a key thing is how much for a taxon because I say it&amp;#39;s the Goldilocks amount you don&amp;#39;t want too little obviously but you also don&amp;#39;t want too much so what is the right amount and how do you regulate that so we&amp;#39;re having ideas we&amp;#39;re collaborating with Dr Marek napparella who&amp;#39;s worked on the protection promoter that helps regulate protection levels and see if we can incorporate that in obviously as I&amp;#39;ve highlighted translating these studies in the dish to human is always a challenge but we&amp;#39;ve got um already in place with that collaborators different Prime models to sort of address that and then a big thing is the delivery approach so you have to think do you just you know inject it directly into the regions of the brain or do you or the in the cardiac issue or is it through you know intramuscular or IV again they&amp;#39;re things that we need to consider and one of the main things that obviously the Pharaoh communities very much aware is read out so we can measure readouts in the dish it changes in mitochondria but again when it comes to clinical trials it is key to even pick up subtle differences and over time to see what we see in the dish how does that translate into humans and it&amp;#39;s and even like the subtle changes in it could be as simple as picking up a cup you know something like that so that&amp;#39;s sort of like the overview of our work like I said it&amp;#39;s smaller about the approach and different things to think about um and where I&amp;#39;m coming from is more about the using um the model approach so hopefully Fast Track these therapies as quickly as possible to the to the clinic and all of this work couldn&amp;#39;t be done without the excellent teamwork across everywhere with everyone and of course funding from um Farah and also the Australian government with the mrff stem cell Mission so thank you for your attention oh sorry my Shell&amp;#39;s still it&amp;#39;s green you can Drury to recognize data should we uh go on with us okay okay and the questions will be at the end so our next speaker series we has so uh Dr rodical Nies as his associate she&amp;#39;s a research director at issue at imagine uh Institute in France and she will talk to us on the role of iron in the mitochondrial uh protein products and how the cellular iron homeostasis is maintained or is Disturbed in this conditions thank you first first of all I would like to to thank you especially to thank God that kiss for this very kind invitation to this first conference so I&amp;#39;m working in Imagine Institute in Paris which is in nature hospital my group is working on mitochondrial disorders and we have a very special interest of physical taxia and I will present you relatively recent results that will be the the starting point for clinical trial so it&amp;#39;s a I must say that the function of fataxine is very difficult to understand and more specifically the consequences of the fatexing defects are very wide and complicated and I will try to show you a small part of these consequences and I will try also to make it very simple because it&amp;#39;s relatively difficult to explain soon as you know fataxine is a mitochondrial proteins these proteins is shown here is located in the mitochondrial Matrix and it is mainly mainly involved in the biogenesis of iron sulfur clusters these ions are for clusters will then be associated with different proteins some of these proteins stay in the mitochondria and some iron safer clusters exceed from the mitochondria and will be associated with other proteins so it means that a defect of ataxine will result in a defect of several proteins inside the mitochondria and outside the mitochondria you know that patients with phenic Ataxia accumulate iron in the brain and in the heart and we were interested in the reason of this iron accumulation and before to show you what happens in traffic Ataxia I will explain you very briefly the major what are the major actors involved in Iron homeostasis in the cell first of all Iron enter into the cells mainly by the fratics by the transaction receptor the iron which is the green spot here are linked to transferrin that transfer the iron and this transferine binds to the transaction receptor that allows the iron to enter into the cell the icon can also enter into the cells via different Transporters that are called non-conferring Bond ion and TBI and then after entering the cells the ion is stored in a in a protein which is called ferritin and this is very important because iron is very toxic but so it has to be protected the cells has to be protected from the ion and at the same times the the a lot of reaction and function in the cells need iron so there is very important to have a very good equilibrium that maintain the appropriate amount of iron into the cells that make the entry that regulate the entry the storage and the exit of the ion and finally the iron exceed from the from the cells using the Ferro protein which is another protein so the regulation that of the iron content is very well known since very long time and briefly it it allows that in low iron conditions there is increased transferring receptor protein here that allows iron uptake and decreased ferritin to limit the iron storage to make it available and a decrease feral protein that limit the iron exit on the contrary in high iron conditions the translation receptor is decreased limiting the iron attack but the ferritin is increased to a lows iron storage and the ferroportin also is increased to allow the iron exit and this will make the amount of iron correctly regulated in the sets so as there is iron accumulation in brain and heart of patients with chronic addiction we decided to measure the iron content in fibroblasts of patients which is a relatively easy cells to obtain and to grow so as you can see here we measure the iron content of fibroblasts from three controls and five patients and we did the experiments in fibroblast with no iron we always high iron concentration in the gross medium and as you can see here the three control cells increase little bit the iron content when grown in high iron content but in the philic Ataxia patients fibroblast there is a very important amount of iron that suggests that these cells are totally unable to limit the iron uptake and we then wanted to understand this mechanism and we first focus on the translation receptor first of all we observe that the Translating receptor accumulates in fibroblasts of clinical texture patients you can see here a picture of the cell in which we have as blue the nucleus and in green the transferring receptor and you can see that there is a very higher signal for transferring receptors in patient cells compared to control sets we then we then find try to understand the the reason of this accumulation of transaction receptor and to make a very long story short what we learn is that transference has several other proteins can undergo modification and one of this modification is the addition of palmite which is a fatty acid and this modification is called palmitoylation so the transition receptor here is shown after addition of this polluted which is the permituation not only transferring receptor but also the non-transferring bond iron transporter the ntbi transporter also undergo Palmetto relation and this Palmetto relation is very important to modify the traffic of the protein in the cells and this is important for these Transporters because they comes from the cell membrane and they have to go inside the cells and then to go back to the membrane so palmito illusion is very important for this type of protein so it modified the traffic and of course also their localization what we observed is that in Friedrich fibroblast there is a decreased parametration of transferring receptor and also on the ntbi transporter and because of that we this result in accumulation of transference receptor at the same membrane which induced iron uptake because the transference receptor is stacked at the same membrane and continue to import iron and of course of iron overload so this is one of the reason of the abnormal and increased amount of iron in in cells of freak Ataxia patients there is also other reasons but it&amp;#39;s it will be too long and I would like now to focus on on this part of the result because we have now a molecule that could modify this abnormal this decreased parameterulation and this molecule is called artisanate it&amp;#39;s an Amity optimism in the derivative which is known for very long time as the anti-malarial so it has been used for very long time in a lot of of countries and very interesting for us in the case of chronic Ataxia this molecule can cause the blood brain barrier and it has been shown that artisanate induced permutation of transference and we then result in Iron overload this has been shown in cancer cells and we use it in fibroblasts of patient with phenic Ataxia and once we observed is that when we incubate when we grow the cells of control and patients with artisanet here you can see the the black box that correspond to the amount of iron in patient cells grown with artisanate meaning that the artisanate reduce has a very strong effect and reduce the ion content in patient sets it&amp;#39;s still a little bit more than in control cells but it has very importantly decreased So based on this results we have decided to set up a clinical trial that we call the Artemis because of the name of artisanetum and uh we we will very soon start this this clinical trial we have it has been delayed for months and monsters because of administrative problems and this is a phase one two clinical trial meaning that it is a study aiming to determine the tolerance and the efficacy of this molecule by this clinical trial we aim to identify the effective dose of artisanate able to reduce iron and we will measure the ion in blood cells in in the patients and the second point is to identify the maximal tolerated dose of active units so it will consist in those escalation study with one tablet of 25 millimeter milligram per day and that will probably progressively increase until we found an effect a decrease of the ion in bbmc so I this is very promising and and I hope that we will have success with this clinical trial but I have also to tell you that as I say this before there is a lot of consequences of attacking deficiency and artists unit will act on the permutualization only this is already very important because it will probably modify the ion uptake from a transparent receptor also from the NTB Transporters but also on other functions some of them being involved in the physiopathology of however there is a lot of consequences of attacks in defect that are respiratory chain defect the the energy production deficiency of different enzymes inside the mitochondria outside the mitochondria especially the hymns and disease the some DNA some some enzymes and protein involve in DNA replication and repair and I don&amp;#39;t say that artisanate will cure completely different cataxia but it will help to to limit the iron uptake that could be detrimental for for the patients and I hope that we&amp;#39;ll have a relatively soon in the six following months uh good news from this clinical trial and before finishing I would like to thank the people who were involved in this work especially foreign was a very brilliant PhD student and Arnold Monique who will perform the clinical trial and I thank you for your attention thank you very much Dr erotic the questions will be at the end the next speaker in the program is Dr Sophie Stephanie but she will join us after the end of the first session due to the time difference she will join us virtually from San Diego and our final speaker for this session now is Dr Mendes George associate professor of pathology and cell biology and Columbia University Dr Mendes good morning everyone and I hope you hear me well um thanks very much first of all to Mr karachias for the kind invitation to share with you in the next 12 to 15 minutes something that we have learned from a different disease not produce a tax yet but spinal muscular atrophy and why spinal muscular atrophy I hope that you will see in a moment the common interests common mechanisms between the two diseases so a little bit um some of the natural history for uh spinal muscular entropy or SMA patients there are mainly five types as you will see here I hope that you will see my pointer um from type zero to type four the large majority of the patients are the SMA Type one more than 50 percent of them um here in this axis is the age this is mostly a juvenile type of the disease affecting mostly babies in the most severe types which is the type zero and the type one this is a fatal disease and patience suffering from SMA of this kind and of these types succumbed to the disease within a year or two after birth SMA Type 2 is the most moderate um type of the disease and sma-3 and even SMA Type 4 these are the milder forms of the disease with mutually nearly normal lifespan but with severe motor disabilities so a little bit about the disease one of the common things together with phrase Factoria is that this is all about a single protein dsmen protein SMN standing for survival of motor neuron in humans there are two genes as shown here responsible for the production of The SMN protein the Gene smn1 and smn2 you do need both genes because deletional mutations of both genes uh results in embryonic lethality um so the disease is causing due to the deletion or the mutation of the smn1g the smn2 gene is a similar type of Gene but unfortunately produces much less full length or proper protein compared to the smn1 so the disease is due to the severe reduction of the full length protein produced by the smn2 gene now how do we study the disease so one of the important things in preclinical Trials to First understand the molecular cellular neuronal circuit mechanisms as well as design potential Therapeutics we need to use an animal model and in SMA we have used the mouse model however the mouse doesn&amp;#39;t have two genes as the humans do the Mouse has a single endogenous SM and Gene that produces SMN and of course similar to humans if you deleted The SMN and don&amp;#39;t do the gene you&amp;#39;re having embryonic retirement so how people decided to do to recapitulate and have an animal model of the disease they have knocked down the endogenous cement and they have taken two copies of the human smn2 and humanize this into the mouse genome by having the two copies the results of this again is the deficiency of The SMN protein now this cartoon shows a typical type 1 phenotype of the clinical symptoms prior to the identification of the genetic cause of the disease it used to be called The Flop infant syndrome because the baby didn&amp;#39;t have any reflexes uh similar to this type one is the so-called Delta 7 Mouse model and you can see here an affected Mouse on its side is alive but it has very little posture and very little reflex compared to the normal Litter Mate um this mice survive approximately two weeks after birth whereas type ones are similar they succumb to the disease a year or so after birth what are the whole marks of the disease first of all the death of spinal mutton neurons in selective spinal segments muscle atrophy and impairment of spinal reflexes and postural defects again these are similar characteristics to what we&amp;#39;re seeing in Friedrich ataxia as um Mirella has eluded previously um we would have liked to see uh the point um that really is key to the pathophysiology of the disease just summarize many years of work from my lab here at Columbia and as well as from others all over the world this is a transverse section of the spinal cord in blue is a spinal motor neuron sending its action through the periphery making synapses with skeletal muscle in order to activate it but the muscle in itself knowing where our muscles are in time and in space this information is provided by this green cell which is essentially neuron known as the proportion neuron which goes and makes direct synaptic contacts with motor neurons so over many years of research now what we have found and the main findings of the disease is first of all that you having loss of this particularly synapses motor neurons effectively dysfunction selective motor neuron death and denervation all these leading to muscle paralysis and if the muscles are affected are reaching the lungs then you having respiratory distress and ultimately death of the patient as well as animal models so these things particularly now with the proprioceptive neurons raising the possibility that there might be common mechanisms between SMA and Fredericks Ataxia and particularly I would like to point out the following scenario what we have shown is that here is a spinal with the neuron that&amp;#39;s the Soma which resides within the spinal cord this is the action in the peripheral nerve and here is the muscle how do motor neurons work well the motor neon has been activated by pre-motor neurons showing here these different green synapses which are opposed to a certain type of potassium Channel which is the KB 2.1 or also known as the delayed rectifier when your these synapses are activated they depolarize or activate the motor neuron the motor neuron actually and finally subsequently fires Action potentials which these Action potentials transmitted to the muscle in order to produce a fuse contraction and muscle movement ultimately joint movement in the context of the disease and certainly spinal muscular atrophy what is really happening is that you&amp;#39;re having fewer premotal synapses particularly from proprioceptive neurons which are glutamateergic and therefore they&amp;#39;re having less ability to activate the motor neurons subsequently to the reduction and dysfunction of those synapses you&amp;#39;re having fewer delayed potassium rectifier channels leading to a reduction in the firing ability and frequency of motor neurons and instead of the normal muscle movements you&amp;#39;re having Twitches effectively um resulting in an ability to move so because of the essence and the critical role proprioceptive sensory synapses play on the postsynaptic motor neuron function then this raise the possibility that perhaps what is happening in SMA might be relevant to Freddy&amp;#39;s Ataxia as well so a little bit about the current therapies since the gene was developed back in 1995 from Judith milky&amp;#39;s lab in France uh there has been an enormous effort uh at the basic medical research level as well as the clinical level and back in 2016 the FDA approved the very first therapy this is called spinraza and it&amp;#39;s based on the antisense polycloniglottite approach this is administered intractically and is supposed to be a drug that sorts out the splicing defect in The SMN uh 2G so this can be applied to all SMA Type patients and of course it does not depend upon the number of copies of the smn2 which is really the moderator of the disease there is no limitation and of course this has to be applied for a lifetime and I will tell you in a moment uh how the second uh FDA approved is the gene therapy as Mirella and Dr yanaki has alluded this is based on a viral approach using their then Associated viruses or AVS this administered in traffic intravenously and of course this applies to all SMA types and this is a one of treatments you&amp;#39;re having one shot and that is it the third and most uh recently approved is a small molecular approach which has which has been uh developed by PTC in collaboration with Ross and the SMA Foundation here in New York this is uh basically a pill you take one pill once a day for the rest of your life it could be applied to all SMA patients older than two months old for a lifetime now um a little bit about the cost and the limitations and the differences of the three Therapies spinraza or here the antisense oligonucleotides cause for the first time 750 000 during the first year and 350 000 dollars per year thereafter for life and this being administered intrinsically which means that the patient has to be admitted into the hospital and injected into the cerebral spinal fluids what are the limitations well first of all The SMN increase depends up how many smn2 coping numbers each patient exists uh it has to be administered within the CNS meaning that perhaps in the periphery that might not be so um accessible you need to have it every three to four months for the entire um life and of course there is pretty high cost considering again is the gene therapy and currently as most of you know is the most expensive therapy for any disease in the world one shot 2.1 million however there are limitations with that first of all uh it cannot be applied to all SMA patients which have having a much higher antibody than 15 milligram per ml it&amp;#39;s restricted to the age so it cannot be uh given to any patients because of issues with the blood brain barrier much more important and this is the major difference between the other two therapies with the viral mediated therapy you have really no control of how much you over expressing as I met the cause of the disease the main issues with a protein so it continues since the the viral will transfect virtually every single neuron that it can be applied to The SMN is going to continuously be over expressing over time and in collaboration with Dr pelicioni another colleague of mine here at Columbia we have recently published and we have cautioned the community that when they&amp;#39;re using an aav particularly with an uncontrollable overexpression of that protein it might have severe toxicity as we could have seen it in the mouse model whether we&amp;#39;ll apply in humans remains to be seen and we hope that we are wrong but of course this has to be taken into serious considerations particularly for neurologists when they are considering offering advice to prospective patients and other limitations that the re-injections is not possible because as soon as you inject the aav you will start the patient is going to start building antibodies and of course there is always a problem of liver toxicity and potential side effects the small molecule approach currently being marketed by Rush at abrisdi it&amp;#39;s much cheaper compared to the other approach but still quite expensive depending upon the weight and the frequency in the country so this is uh in the U.S approximately hundred thousand dollars to 300 a year once a day appeal um there are also limitations with this approach there is um um currently you&amp;#39;re not allowed at least from the FDA point of view to be administered in neonates um it also May Target other transcripts and that suggests that you might have potential off-target effects and of course the cost which is also needs to be taken into account still is considered to be very high so just to summarize what I&amp;#39;m hoping frigid Axia Community is going to learn from what we have found in spinal muscular atrophy research and Therapeutics is that this was extremely fast considering from the moment that we have developed we have discovered the cause of the disease in spinal muscular atrophy back in 1995 and 2016 just over 20 years this has been a tremendous success in identifying the mechanisms and also bringing therapy into the patients however this could not have been done without the production and intense research efforts based on animal models cellular models not only mice but also other animal models that this was key but the mouse model particularly is terribly important as a pre-clinical model in order to go for an FDA approval and then of course non-human primates will be used for toxicity but without proof of concept and proof of principle that we can rescue the mouse from the disease that would not have been possible and this came together with basic uh and clinical personnel so when The SMN level is reduced to 20 the SMA is also considered to be a multi-organ disorder so it does not really only affects the central nervous system although the central nervous system is the major issue you also have other issues with heart liver lungs and so forth and so on so the level of The SMN protein is key to the extent that other organs are affected however the neural circuits between the motor neurons and the sensory neurons are key to understanding motor disorders and motor control there is also a clear and limited therapeutic window because it has been very well established right now that The SMN is very much needed during embryonic development and early postnatal periods SMN is not so much needed in adults so as soon as and it&amp;#39;s imperative to diagnose the situation pretty fast in order to intervene as fast as possible and it&amp;#39;s current the current uh thinking uh in therapeutic is that the earlier you intervene the better the outcome above all and I want to finish with a positive hopeful message that although SMA it&amp;#39;s not cured there are three currently three powerful therapists that help first alleviating and helping from uh death of a patient something that it would have been impossible 20 years ago and right now we might not be fixing everything but we&amp;#39;re setting getting closer and closer and on that note I would like to thank you and of course should time be I will be more than happy to discuss any questions foreign [Music] so my question is that we were discussed about the possible treatments and the technologies that are advancing how close are commercialization let&amp;#39;s say to be available to patients for all this kind of stuff okay I think the question is from a fake patient all these Advanced Technologies how close could be to commercialization and I don&amp;#39;t know who would like to uh [Music] online now uh I would uh take this question to the next panel where actually we are discussing about the pipeline update so I would suggest to uh to take it as a note and move it forward to the next panel okay um another question yes Dr Francis so first of all I would like to thank all the speakers for the wonderful presentations and talks and especially those that came from abroad uh either through Zoom or in person that&amp;#39;s uh we&amp;#39;re greatly honored um I have a question for um uh Dr Agnes I think I really love the presentation congratulations for the very inspiring work that you&amp;#39;ve been doing have you um do you have any insights maybe on that parliamentarilation defect that you see on the transferring molecules whether that is a consequence for example of a metabolic switch or perhaps a defect in gene regulation maybe some uh parametration transfer azes are not expressed as high I think actually we are able to to understand why there is difficult motivation it&amp;#39;s relatively simple when you have found the solution but it was very difficult to demonstrate it actually the fat accent defect results in the iron sulfur Crystal containing proteins one of them is lipoic acids that make the lipoic acid that is involved in the pyruva dehatogenase activity and when there is no lipoic acid centers and no lipoic acid there is decreased pdh activity decrease acetically synthesis and decrease Palmetto willcoa which need the capacity for for some disease so this is there is a direct relationship between products and defects and permituation that&amp;#39;s wonderful and is the drug that you&amp;#39;re targeting the defect also affecting that cycle that actually we don&amp;#39;t know how the antigenet acts what we precisely but that what we know is that it increased the parameter relation of transferring receptor also on other ion transporter and probably also proteins that we didn&amp;#39;t have looked at for the moment thank you could I address the question to Mirella also if you&amp;#39;re in line yes yes thank you [Music] University thank you also very much for the wonderful presentation and for sharing uh such inspiring and exciting data with us here today uh my question um is uh concerning the development of these novel vectors that you&amp;#39;re trying to Target I guess different tissues with this so how do you envision this in the future do you think that it&amp;#39;s going to end up as a combination therapy using multiple vectors or are you trying to find a single Vector that targets the uh disease tissues while at the same time protects or does not enter liver for example or other tissues thank you okay thank you um for the question and the compliment some we don&amp;#39;t know we we&amp;#39;re throwing everything at it um it I imagine exactly like with the other speakers I think treatments for most diseases is a multi-prong approach and I think it will require you know various approaches for different tissues that you&amp;#39;re targeting and even if it&amp;#39;s a gene delivery it won&amp;#39;t be just Gene delivery I&amp;#39;m sure that you&amp;#39;ll have to add you know other therapies in combination with that I I would be surprised if it&amp;#39;s the one aav that can you know the magic aav that can infect all the relevant tissues and not liver um so I guess it&amp;#39;s just this is the you know like um I guess the next session and the clinicians would be better to answer this but it would be depend on what is the most um prominent tissue that needs to be targeted for this individual is it the cardiac you know is it regions of the brain and how we approach that and um and again with aavs I mean it was brought up with um the um George&amp;#39;s talk about SMA um toxicities is one big thing and with gene therapy you just have one shot that&amp;#39;s the the high risk with gene therapy um in particularly when it&amp;#39;s you know in entering into cells and that&amp;#39;s why it has to be much more carefully thought out um in that way so I didn&amp;#39;t directly answer your question but I guess the bottom line is no we&amp;#39;re we&amp;#39;re just seeing what aav targets the cardiac and maybe probably another auv that targets preferentially you know the cerebellar and so forth and it would just wait and see thank you okay thank you actually have um um you didn&amp;#39;t show us what the promoter of this aavco um is um [Music] yes so um for the screen at the moment it&amp;#39;s just a standard we&amp;#39;re just using a green fluorescent gfp for the screen so it&amp;#39;s just um a CMV and we in our work we use a lot of the human elongation Factor promotes so it&amp;#39;s just a generic promoter once we choose the candidate aavs we are going to address the promoter and the approach we would like to take is to look at the frataxan endogenous promoter so we&amp;#39;ve had conversations with our collaborator and colleague in U.S Dr Merrick naparella who&amp;#39;s published work in looking at different regions of the for tax and promoter to see what is the minimal promoter region to give rise to for tax and expression and um and I&amp;#39;ve just put in a grant earlier this year to look at that with to the Australian government to screen the three or four different promoters because a lot of it will be about you know obviously regulating protection levels and you don&amp;#39;t want it too high you may be just a minimal promoter would be sufficient to avoid toxicity due to fretaxin obviously there&amp;#39;s also maybe toxicity due to the aav itself but at least the protection so we&amp;#39;ve had these conversations with um the Sheck you ideally you want to a highly efficient aav and then play with the promoter you know so you want minimal you know transfection minimal dose to to so because it&amp;#39;s so efficient that&amp;#39;s the approach we&amp;#39;re taking thank you thank you the main message I wanted to give is that again it comes down to flexibility because again like we heard in the SMA you know talker maybe you know it&amp;#39;s about delivering for tax and protein or for tax and mRNA or a compound like that small molecule but that compound you can&amp;#39;t just give the small molecule you know be degraded so it needs to encapsulated inappropriate delivery system to enter into the appropriate tissue and nanoparticles just gives you such um you know the vast materials the engineering you&amp;#39;ve got a lot lot more flexibility to work with so aavs you know work well in certain ways but they are limited even with the DNA you know at the moment you can only deliver DNA and a certain size whereas another particles you&amp;#39;ve got a lot more open but with that obviously um it takes a lot more work to screen so once you find this works you&amp;#39;ve got to find the appropriate delivery system to um deliver that so definitely nanoparticles needs to be on the table as a delivery system for fa in parallel with with everything else that&amp;#39;s you know from you know our perspective thank you okay so I think that it is a time to to close for a for a an hour let me let me thank the whole panel it was really forward looking and thank you uh Dr janaki thank you Dr virena daughter from Australia thank you uh and yes thank you all it was really inspiring for our patients to see that the research is ongoing and we are looking forward for the next session that starts in an hour with an update on the pipeline so without further Ado Lance is served so please feel free thank you so much",

    "transcript": "the national guests this Sunday tomorrow is in the general elections time so when we designed with Euro Euro Ataxia this conference actually the government hasn&amp;#39;t informed us of course of this general election and that&amp;#39;s why that was a very huge burden with uh for us so because we have done the commitment that we have made our commitment to our partners that was very difficult to change dates uh that&amp;#39;s the reason that why our main neurologists the ones that we cooperate with they are coming out of all places in Greece uh speaking through Zoom I will we will start in in one minute I see everyone is coming and that&amp;#39;s the reason that we have made this this modification foreign we will start by introducing our first for the Greek panel let&amp;#39;s say speaker of the day which actually is Professor kimiskidis Vasilios I salute everyone I salute Professor Kursi squeeze I see him online the professors professor karadema and professor vasilius kimis professor dinoplos is here with us unfortunately he had a bad headache and he&amp;#39;s not going to to join us so we will without further Ado sorry for letting us for letting you uh let&amp;#39;s say a little bit late out of the schedule it has been a wonderful sessions uh till now and this is the reason that the schedule has fall a little bit behind but without further Ado I will introduce professor who is a professor in neurology in a professional in neurology in HEPA University Hospital in Thessaloniki and Aristotle University he is a a very good friend of our association and very and very and we are very happy and fortunate that we we cooperate with him professor kimis kid is the the floor is yours so dear colleagues ladies and gentlemen first of all please let me express my sincere thanks to the Hellenic federal tax Association and to vasilis carriages in particular organizing this event and of course for the kind invitation to participate so my disclosures so in the next very few minutes I will outline the care of fa patients at my Center which is located at the ahepa hospital of the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki the care of these patients actually takes place at the NDA neuromuscular unit India HEPA Hospital and it reflects a collaboration between the laboratory of clinical neurophysiology which is led by Associated Professor Maria Antonov the second University Department of Pediatrics which is represented by Professor evangelos Pablo and the first Department of Neurology which is directed by me and I would like to stress the importance of the close collaboration between pediatricians and adult neurologists because these close collaborations ensures the smooth transition of patients from the care of the former the pediatricians to the care of the latter the adult neurologist currently we follow and care for a cohort of 13 adult fa patients age 17 to 47 years with a mean age of 29. and the essence of this girl is crystallized in the word Maldives discipline narrative all patients typically attend our unit on a manual basis once per year not including of course extra visits should any emergency any special issue okay and during each one of these visits the patients are sequentially examined by a neurologist who is leading the overall care as well as a cardiologist an orthopedic surgeon a pneumonologist a physiotherapist and a psychologist in addition to that consultations by all relevant Specialties for instance or pharmacologists entice clinical geneticists or specialists in diabetes are arranged as needed while the patient is on the side and in my humble opinion this is a major advantage because mobility issues are of obvious importance to sa patients and therefore the minimization of transfer time of transfer cost and transfer effort is considered highly beneficial by both patients and their caregivers now just a few words about the contribution of each member of our team the neurologist has already said is the overall coordinator he or she assesses the patient urologically at its visit with clinical measures standard measures such as sorrow and fast and summarizes an assesses the results of all other examinations and assessments such as cardiac biochemical neurophysiological or Imaging and thereby he can monitor both the primary and the secondary symptoms of the disease but he is the coordinator our physiotherapist is involved in the design and the monitoring of The individualized Rehabilitation plan I will not enter in details but certain key elements of this plan which of course is designed based on the ambulatory status of the patient assuming the slide one particularly important facet of the collaboration between the physiotherapists and the neurologist is the management of spasticity as a first step non-pharmacological measures such as strengthening and muscle stretching are introduced by the physiotherapist but as a second step permalogical measures both systematic drugs as well as local pharmacological measures for instance botulinum toxin are used at our department are notable in particular has the expertise to utilize effectively these three in inappropriate cases the contribution of the cardiologists cannot be overemphasized he is on site I repeat and performs ECG and echocardiography on each and every visit and should concerns about cardiac arrhythmias emerged he arranges everything he arranges holy monitoring or Loop recordings or any other appropriate investigations and interventions the pneumonologist is also on site and provides a comprehensive assessment of respiratory function but also explores the presence of sleep disordered breathing and arranges appropriate testing and management the orthopedic surgeon again is also on science all these people gather together when the patients arrive and routinely perform spinal examination Monitors care progression and provides helpful suggestions about bracing about scoliosis surgery and about the management investigation osteoporosis last but not least our psychologists screens or mental health issue or patients for the presence of depressions for the presence of anxiety or psychosis this is extremely important she also provides a first level of management but if needed patients are readily transferred readily referred to science countries for further pharmacological treatment I previously mentioned that consultations by other Specialists are readily available at our unit let me give you just two examples for instance patients with swallowing difficulties so for these patients a comprehensive assessment by a relevant ENT expert is visible is available and then on the basis of the results He suggests strategies to overcome this video and similarly a consultation by an ophthalmologist is regularly requested to assess vision and also rule other other causes of vision deterioration in these patients non-essa related causes or of course the presence of diabetic retinopathy finally speaking of treatments all of our patients receive symptomatic medications for the various aspects of the disease as already mentioned and through them just through them received Q10 and vitamin E now why three of them these were ambulatory patients that had low levels of both Q10 and vitamin E so we decided on the basis of some fairly low quality evidence admittedly to administer them however none of our patients receive specific fa treatment I referred to skylaris of course and it would be a major fit for all patients in Greece if this would be visible for instance By An Early Access program and I believe that I Echo the opinion of all uh our Greek colleagues on this issue we are hopeful that the management seemed that I outline covers the needs of our patients at least to some degree of course more can be done and more should be done to improve further the management of these patients and ideally it should be done through collaborations collaboration with the Hellenic federal tax Association and of course with all other centers in Greece and abroad and I would be happy to discuss any specific aspects on this issue so I thank you for your attention thank you Professor thank you for uh this uh concise presentation of the capabilities that we have at our HEPA uh University in Thessaloniki and I welcome a professor zaffirio dimitrios who is a pediatric neurologist and uh he is uh the head of the Hippocratic University Hospitality Thessaloniki pediatric neurology Services uh he uh he will speak about also the capabilities that they have in their Center and how they they manage our patients in their Center Professor the the floor is yours thank you very much Mr karachias for this wonderful opportunity to gather with other colleagues all among Europe uh unfortunately in a difficult weekend for Greece uh I mean organization from an organizational point of view uh I wish you know that I have mass first to be with you uh at uh dohoro at this very moment but unfortunately uh some problems that uh arise through this election weekend made this impossible but again thank you very much for this very kind invitation to talk uh I think on behalf of my other colleagues pediatric neurologists in Greece but mainly for saroniki and from the scope of the child neurologist regarding the opportunities and the possibilities that we have to uh follow diagnospheres follow and why not provide [Music] a more substantive therapy for patients with free drugs attraction I will not have any slides uh I think that vasiliski miskiris made a wonderful introduction because more or less uh uh this collaboration scene that is followed in a HEPA hostel for adult patients with fried rice Ataxia is more or less what we are doing in hypocratio hospital but I would like to underline some special aspects of freedax ataxia regarding the Pediatric AIDS first that most of these patients they do have their Fair symptoms during the first two decades of life so I think that uh first it&amp;#39;s the uh duty of a pediatric neurologist to diagnose pre-dixotaxium there are of course some patients that manifest symptoms after the second decade of life but most of these patients they do present in pediatric age so we have this special knowledge of these symptoms which are mainly neurological uh we follow more than 10 patients pediatric patients under 17 years and I assume that at least three or four of the patients that are followed in a HEPA Hospital our patients first diagnosed by us at hippocratician uh a clinical hospital at the First pediatric clinic uh we have the same way to follow these patients uh it&amp;#39;s a multidiscing disciplinary approach with the neurology or the neurologist organizing uh the follow-up but also having other doctors I would add here also the endocrinologist the Pediatric endocrinologist because as you know better than myself diabetes is a common manifestation of Freedia cataxia and we need to also help in this issue we have a the whole range of physical therapists in gratio there&amp;#39;s a special Developmental Center called Center focus where we have the occupational speech Therapies in the physical therapist and we are trying to uh uh stay in line with uh what their colleagues in special centers all over the world are doing regarding the scales that are used the motor scales I mean but also swallowing scales and every other scale trying to make us speak a Common Language when we refer to these patients and this is very important I&amp;#39;ll come very quickly to what I think is the most important aspect of my presentation to you because this way having all these Specialists and having all these knowledge as our colleagues abroad make us uh very capable of uh taking part into clinical trials and this is something that I would like to underline my Center participates in more than 20 clinical trials more than eight having to do with neuromuscular disorders uh epilepsy multiple sclerosis and all um all uh other areas of pediatric neurology and I think this is something that uh three years give us knowledge about uh how we can proceed with these patients and uh having a meticulously follow up as vasilis explained to our little pediatric patients so the same is true also for uh one or two centers in Athens of course my good friend and colleague are gears dinoplus uh almost participate in every trial that we are uh are well and we have our collaboration with our adult colleagues and we are trying to make this transition uh possible however as you may well know sometimes the Pediatric patients are stuck into pediatricians or pediatric neurologists and this is something that needs to be further worked on uh in order to ensure a smooth transition from pediatric to adult age it&amp;#39;s very important that in cases where new therapies new Innovative therapists Precision therapies uh arise we can work together with our colleagues adult neurologists this was the case in uh at least two novel medications for therapies for spinal muscular atrophy and I think that we are more than ready to uh uh have patience both Pediatric and adults uh participate in any new clinical trial but also to give them the opportunity to try at least uh the novel medication that has already got permission from the FDA uh regarding Friedrich ataxia but apart also from friedrich&amp;#39;s Ataxia and because this is as uh a series told me Euro Ataxia project of course we all know that Friedrich Ataxia is the most common actually at least a genetic attacks at least in childhood but I think there is the knowledge of the people here and the possibility to work multi-disciplinary to diagnose other forms of inherited ataxias uh also through the genetic you know very well that we diagnose at least 70 percent more spino several taxias or spinal a Heritage plastic caplesias or some metabolic disorder like for example disorders that may mimic [Music] so I think that Greece is more than ready and I speak for matante saluniki but I assume it&amp;#39;s the same for Athens to uh help with patients in a scientific way done in other parts Europe and America as well uh regarding therapies I think that uh mostly uh our patients my patients receive supportive therapy uh six of the ten patients receive a dependent uh and we have seen some stabilization but to be honest we don&amp;#39;t have a measure apart from uh typical cardiologist measurement regarding the wall of the thickness of the wall of uh the leventricle to say that this works but at least from a cardiologist&amp;#39;s point of view our little patients are doing relative well I know that we don&amp;#39;t have too many evidence of proof or a debit on but many patients uh read some papers that although contradictory they maybe report a small benefit so that&amp;#39;s why we are giving I don&amp;#39;t think there is a robust body of evidence for any other therapist like vitamin E or uh coenzyme q but you know better than me that where there&amp;#39;s no therapy every therapy even with a very very tiny positive effect is better than no therapy uh with his words I say that we are ready to cooperate with our pediatric colleagues in other uh parts of Greece that uh adult neurologists or colleagues as we have done in the past in order to give patients with red eye Ataxia uh the best possible clinical care from a very high scientific point of view thank you very much thank you thank you thank you professor and thank you for showcasing uh exactly the capabilities that we have and it is very important for our patients to understand uh that throughout uh Greece even though it&amp;#39;s a small country it has been a substantive network of key experts and key expert senders for their trade men and this is something that it is uh uh it is uh it is uh very well established over the years and we are very happy that we cooperate with you so I will move on to uh to uh Professor jorgo scotsies who actually is the professor a professor in neurology and neurogenetics at the United Hospital in Athens which actually is the European Network reference Network for uh rare neuromuscular diseases and he is part of uh of the effects also study so we heard earlier this day from Dr York shoes about the effects and the work that we have done uh Professor could say thank you for being with us and uh showing what we are doing there in a unit thank you thank you very much it&amp;#39;s an honor for me to be speaking here um were it not for the for for the elections um I would I would be there with you um so I&amp;#39;m very glad you invited me I will share again because short talk um for you while I so I I hope now this is visible um because as as mentioned previously this is a an attacks yeah meeting and not just the friedrich&amp;#39;s Ataxia I will give you some data from Greece some numbers regarding both free drugs Ataxia and and other repeat expansion attacks that we&amp;#39;ve been studying for several years in Athens um I want to say that um I have co-headed along with the professor yuriakaradima for the past six years now the neurogenetics unit at the first Department of Neurology um in the University of Athens the Unity Hospital so I will talk a bit about uh who we are and give you some numbers concerning the patients we see but your year will take tell you a lot more about the laboratory side of things and what kind of tests we&amp;#39;ve done all these years and then I will give you some data the sort of thing we have collected over the years regarding free drugs and some other repeat expansion taxes in Greece so the neurogenetics unit and Athens is quite unique in Greek terms it was um it was uh founded in the early 90s by Professor vasilopoulos who in the area of neurogenetics has been a great leader in Greece and was a teacher of all of us um the vision is that it combines a very specialized outpatients neurogenetics Clinic with a neurogenetics laboratory and that brings uh patience and and investigations together and helps us reach final molecular diagnosis and more patients and then take it from there towards genetic counseling follow-up and treatment the unit has been strengthened considerably by being part of of the first Department of Neurology which is um part of the Ern RND Network there for now participates in the attacks and HSP disease groups or vrn RND but it&amp;#39;s also been very important for us that we&amp;#39;ve been part of effects for the last five years now and I think that should be also um note um from my point of view I had the Pinnacle side of things so we&amp;#39;ve been running in your genetics clinic now for many years um just to give you the date of the last 10 years um we have seen over 4 000 patients and regarding a taxes um about 12 to 13 percent of our workload concerns ataxias so um we&amp;#39;re not pure a taxi experts I don&amp;#39;t think in Greece one could say that there are neurologists that are so focused on Ataxia but as a substantial amount of our work and our interest is devoted to our tax years but we examine these patients we follow them up we we score them with Sarah&amp;#39;s cause if they are parts of effects they are studied in much more detail by my colleague Dr Kanye who is I think the only person from our group that has actually uh is with you there and can talk to you more about um this side of things um I just want to show you a map because the neurogenetics unit is is quite unique in its characteristics um in within the Greek public sector we have more or less diagnosed patients with free drugs Ataxia since 1997 and I think most of our colleagues in Greece refer at least for molecular diagnosis their cases to the unit so you can see an overview of all the patients that have been diagnosed in the units in the last over 25 years um the the it&amp;#39;s a 117 patients in total in you can see the geographical distribution it shows that it&amp;#39;s widespread there are families with free drugs all over Greece and um it&amp;#39;s definitely from how to view the most commonly uh diagnosed hereditary Ataxia we don&amp;#39;t follow up of course all of these patients A lot of these patients are followed up systematically now the centers like Thessaloniki Professor kimiskidis by pediatric neurologist Professor do not open los Prof but we do often diagnose them and we have an overview we follow quite a lot of patients in Athens because of effects also and we have entered 32 patients into effects and follow them at least once a year so we&amp;#39;ve looked into the genetic epidemiology of free drugs some years back there might be some areas in the Aegean which have clusters of the disease um and and some islands such as icaria or Milos we found had more cases uh than expected but the overall prevalence according based on our date is around one in a hundred thousand patients which is a bit less than some Western European countries but still significant when we look at our cohort we see that if we focus on early on City Ataxia or uh recessive attacks also affected siblings around 50 percent of our cases and this is from a series of 192 index cases seen over 24 years are free drugs attacks yeah and of course we have uh we have a picture of these patients at presentation even though we only follow a a a a minority of them regularly and you can see that in terms of sex ratio they are um equally divided um their agent presentation is is around 25 years so the there is diagnostic delay there the age of tonset in our code the mean nature at answered is around 15 years of age and we have 15 patients around 12 which have a late onset and milder disease you can see here data from our effects uh cohort 13 patients have been followed up for at least three years and you can see the rate of change of the Sarah score just to make a point of how these patients are properly um characterized Within um the the eFax Consortium um I have a few things to say regarding other repeat expansionary taxes which we have been systematically diagnosing at least for the last 12 years um so the scars um fragile X Tremor Ataxia syndrome and canvas a more recent addition and you can see in the map on the left um there is a distribution in the patients we&amp;#39;ve diagnosed less so than in free drugs I&amp;#39;m not so sure that we are receiving perhaps as many referrals as as we could have for these eight taxes um you can see that these are much rarer diseases in total all these patients are 37 diagnosed cases that come 131 families and this is shown that here in a bit more detail um Greece primarily has scar once KATU and Scar 7 regarding the classic scars scar 3 mashado Joseph&amp;#39;s disease and scarcitys is ex very very rare but this new repeat expansion attacks yeah canvas that you all know about is actually quite common especially if you look for it in the right group of people so scar panel we do hundreds of these and and you&amp;#39;re here we&amp;#39;ll tell you more about this and the hit rate is is around four percent but not more whereas in canvas if you screen late on Saturday tax yes you have a hit rate that is about 10 percent and if these patients have the the full Triad you know of canvas the hit rate is very high um so of course over the years um the unit has published several papers on on repeat expansionary taxes on free drugs and now we&amp;#39;re doing more work of course with NGS as well I think this is important um because this was a really relatively undeveloped field in Greece when I was starting at the unit um and uh of course joining eFax being part of vrn R D um and uh supporting the Greek Ataxia patient groups all these things are very important so let me just conclude um by saying that the neurogenetics unit or the Unity Hospital has focused important clinical Education and Research work on Greek Ataxia patients and over the years we have established a significant Greek hereditary attacks a registry that of course can get better and and more complete um we our work is strengthened by the being part of eFax and ER and RND our data showed freedrax a taxi of course is the most common hereditary attacks in Greece with a widespread distribution other repeat expansionary taxes seem substantially less common with a possible exception of canvas if you look for it in selected late onset cohorts and of course we are very happy that this networking for a taxi specialist is happening and we want to work closer with all our colleagues around Greece I think Greece is is mature to move on to the next level of caring for these patients and we want to continue working close with the the Hellenic Ataxia Association and again thank you very very much for the invitation thank you thank you Professor kusis because uh it&amp;#39;s a it was a very a very uh detailed and very uh presentation that shows exactly what&amp;#39;s the situation here in the country and of course I could Echo all your conclusions in terms of the need for patient Registries as we are getting closer and closer to treatments our next speaker and thank you for being here with us uh obviously you you are from the close by area and the elections have not be a problem and I presenter here is the Nobles who is an associate professor in pediatric neurology at article Hospital in Athens he works with uh with our patients in a very big hospital and since who is supposed to to to present at the beginning where it&amp;#39;s not capable of join you will present the whole capabilities of article then okay the floor is yours um thank you very much for the invitation and I&amp;#39;m glad I&amp;#39;m here the elections brought me closer to you so um I&amp;#39;m gonna present you uh actually I&amp;#39;m gonna move into the clinical grounds because uh I don&amp;#39;t want to present our capabilities it&amp;#39;s pretty much the same as the previous one and we&amp;#39;ll collaborate all together but um I choose this title uh urgent unmet need for friedrich&amp;#39;s attacks a patient and by urgent I&amp;#39;m also give a Time flavor a Time parameter because the time concept is different is different for the patients indifferent for the caregivers is different for the scientist a different for the clinician and it&amp;#39;s different for the industry um as a clinician I&amp;#39;m closer to the patient so my thoughts reflect mainly patience thoughts I&amp;#39;m gonna present cases and uh just give um our worries uh from cases and I present a Maria who is a very beautiful girl uh born on 2011 at age of six she started having some running difficulties some fatigue clumsiness nothing very important but that uh but at the age of seven She developed hypertrophic cardiomyopathy uh we saw that girl at seven and a half uh she had the sensory Ataxia and absent reflexes so the diagnosis was pretty obvious the genetic test was done and uh she had she has Friedrich Ataxia um and then we did have some evidence about medication because we have to provide something to our patients the evidence is it was not that robust but as Professor zafiri has mentioned before we need to do something so we placed here on a debenham so she started taking a debenham and she was pretty stable in a debenham and as you can see with on the Sarah test and uh Sarah test icars and the uh the first test she is even a little better so we&amp;#39;re pretty happy with that but still we&amp;#39;re worried now we have Maria like just before the diagnosis and uh trying to do the tandem walking and the two and a half years after treatment she&amp;#39;s still doing pretty well she&amp;#39;s happy but she&amp;#39;s struggling a lot and definitely she needs something better then I&amp;#39;m going to present some other cases uh and that&amp;#39;s Christian and Mateo two brothers and we start with Christians that he has a peculiar diagnostic Odyssey just before the diagnosis uh actually he was diagnosed initially with uh cardiomyopathy he even had a cardiac biopsy and then develop some clumsiness and steady walking Falls that brought him to a developmental pediatrician and then to a child neurology and the diagnosis was made at that time and [Music] his cardiomyopathy was quite substantial he got treatment for that and he was placed again on a debenham and then we wanted to and as you can see uh the Sarah test was um uh not uh improved substantially but actually you can see some decline on his motor abilities by that&amp;#39;s going up but that means the higher score is worse so we see the Sarah test and like icar test is getting worse here is the first test that still is getting worse though so I depend on it&amp;#39;s not working and we had with this guy because his brother was younger age and we saw him just after the diagnosis even without any symptoms and we had the opportunity at that time to see if we could prevent this boy for cardiomyopathy for um or for motor decline since we have a patient that we can treat him early we start I dipping on right after the diagnosis without cardiomyopathy but guess what he was pretty stable but at one year later he developed cardiomyopathy and his cardiomyopathy get got even worse so we failed to prevent the the disease even we treat him very early so that&amp;#39;s to me is a failure is a failure because um nowadays in all these neurodegenerative disease we want to treat them early before the new the generation and here we had no luck and we hear the Saras tests and the first test and uh this is Mateo a diagnosis we see him that time them walking that&amp;#39;s a diagnosis and then two years later he&amp;#39;s still ambulatory he&amp;#39;s walking but he stuck them book is not he&amp;#39;s not able to do tandem walk um and that&amp;#39;s actually a it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s very uh sad for us to see that progression of the disease and always were looking for a light always we are looking for something new something to maybe to stabilize and even make this patient better and we do have now some evidence about other treatments alone and still I mean the data is not that robust but uh uh it&amp;#39;s something that we want to to try but the age the age the age of we can use this medication only because the study was done a patient between 16 and 40 years of age so um there is a limitation here this is a limitation that uh it&amp;#39;s very difficult for the patients for the doctors to wait until 16 years of age to keep going with the neurodegeneration to keep going with the cardiomyopathy and weight and until 16 years of age to try this medication um I hope to have more robust Data before the age of 16 because a pediatric neurologist so we can have this tool this weapon in our Armature and I want to acknowledge our pediatric neurology department we are we have a neurogenetic clinic we follow six patients with a fried auction a lot of other patients with neurogenetic disorders and we collaborate collaborate with all other departments we try to evolve into trials and into the registry thank you very much foreign opoulos because you showed us the perspective of the of the clinician uh on the early ages of our children this is very important because uh it is uh we as parents when we start this journey we need to have uh to build on on on Hope and to build on uh on the idea that that this disease or any Ataxia disease at some point in time may be treatable and the earliest this approach this intervention the earliest this intervention comes into play the early the better the effect and the better the results will be to the patient so thank you for sharing this and uh for all the work that you are doing at article Hospital uh uh our last speaker for the this Greek panel is our professor yoria karadima who is actually is the co-director with uh Dr kutsis at the unit of neurodegenetic uh testing and neurodic diseases in a you need your hospital who is actually with us today sees there at the at the unit and performs all the all the all the Cooperative tests with our patients thank you krisha for being here with us and professor karadima she will present us the capabilities that they have in terms of diagnosis our patients and not only for the patients but also for the families thank you Professor thanks a lot hereditary attacks Association for the kindly introduction their members of the present Conference of the Euro Ataxia good evening I hope you have a very nice attendance of the conference today are put to the Greek mountains I hope that I would like to be with you but because of the elections I can&amp;#39;t I hope another time I&amp;#39;ll be there with you so these are my disclosures in the following 10 minutes I am going to present you the neurogenetics laboratory of the national and capitalistian University of Athens that is situated in the initial hospital I&amp;#39;m going to give you some information about the genetic diagnosis that carried out in our laboratory since 1997 the quality of our tests and at the end I&amp;#39;m going to talk to you about our activities for research education and clinical care so uh uh as my colleague as my dear calling uh Professor kuchis has already mentioned it the neurogenetics unit of a Unity on hospital is consisted of two parts the neurogenetic outpassing clinic and then neurogenetic laboratory the neurogenetic Unicity of its goals through the close collaboration of this distinct but either wine Services which strive towards the establishment of a final diagnosis and the provision of comprehensive genetic counseling the laboratory has clinical and scientific expertise in inherited neurological disorders and has systematically provided molecular diagnostic services at the national level since 1995 performing over of 80 000 genetic tests for patients with suspected neurogenetic disorders the lab is structured according to the international guidelines and design with the necessary technological infrastructure for the study of DNA such as as you can see in the present slide automated nuclear tested extractor thermal cyclers Imaging Imaging system for gel documentation genetic analyzer and most recently very lately a genetic analyzer for the next for the operation of Next Generation sequencing our neurogenetics lab employs molecular biology techniques like a Sanger sequencing fragment analysis repeat Prime PCR mlpa collection sequencing it follows uh it follows external and internal equality controls periodically by the European molecular quality Network and quality control and the Cyprus Institute of Neurology and genetics respectively the laboratory also follows a specific quality control manual and we assume that it will be accredited successfully for the International Organization for standardization ISO 151.89 by the critic accreditation system exceed by the end of 2023. more specifically more specifically we started the investigation of the molecular investigation of the hereditary ataxias in 1990 in 1997 with the establishment of molecular protocols for the investigation of fried rice Ataxia we continued in 2012 with the investigation of the major spinal cerebellum taxes like scan 1 2 3 6 and 7. in 2015 we established the molecular protocols for the investigation of of Scar 17 in 2019 forsca 36 2020 for FX tasks and 2021 for cannabis last year we started investigating all all the other taxes for point mutation using the the new generation sequencing analysis until now we have the largest clinically characterized cohorts of patients with hereditary ataxias at the national level as for the genetic test more specifically over 1 400 DNA tests have been operated for hereditary taxes in our lab since 1997. as you can see we have done 682 tests for free dehataxia 456 Force car panels compromised one two three six and seven Spanish uh 92 forska 36 93 for FX does 99 for kanban 6 16 for Scott 17. so it&amp;#39;s worth to mention that we are the the only uh we are the only lab which operate in the public sector Goods operate genetic testing for hereditary ataxias in our lab there is a bio storage of DNA samples from more than 1 000 patients all over Greece so a about our actions as it has been already mentioned uh by my colleague my dear calling professional coaches the past he has some critical papers about hereditary taxes have been published in international journals by the scientific stuff our projects in in what is as applied research understanding area taxes and insisting interaction our research activities mainly for the University of Athens we are a sender of expertise in neurological rare diseases for Greece and for the European Union we are also members of the European freedrax attacks a Consortium for translation studies effects our educational activities include other graduates and postgraduate teaching and message dissertation presentation and talk for saying different conferences and bad things associations as you can see we are a unique and relatively small Hub but as you know not challenge is too big if you have the right team all the members of our unit work hard and do their best for the study of patience with hereditary ataxias we believe that we have much more to offer in achieving positive scientific knowledge the formulation of guidelines at the best service for patients with a great joy that finally the approval of the first drug for the most common Ataxia is a fact we are going to stand by the Helen free breaks a taxi Association aside every time it is needed thank you all for your attention thank you Professor thank you all thank you for the panel uh professor kimis kidis professor Kurtis professor zafirio professor dinoplos and Professor karadima thank you for because you showed exactly what we can offer to our patients and as an holistic basis approach and this is very important for the families and the patients uh I think that we have exceeded our time and we will move on to the next session very quickly thank you",

speaker whom I&amp;#39;ve known for quite some time um many of you may have heard fa&amp;#39;s um with this quote fa does not define me you&amp;#39;ve probably heard that a lot from faers well that&amp;#39;s true of Kyle fa does not define him all of his accomplishments Define him he&amp;#39;s a University graduate he graduated in with an engineering degree after five years he couldn&amp;#39;t do it in four um and after a couple of years of working in engineering he decided that it wasn&amp;#39;t for him and he wanted to ride his bike for a living so that&amp;#39;s what he&amp;#39;s done for the last 15 years or so he is the uh founder and the director of the Rita taxia program through Farah and over the last 10 or 12 years they&amp;#39;ve raised over $10 million through that program and I think just as importantly the program has brought together thousands of people who otherwise would never have known about Frederick&amp;#39;s sat taxia and it&amp;#39;s brought together the whole fa community in a lot of different ways and I think that&amp;#39;s one of his greatest accomplishments he&amp;#39;s he&amp;#39;s a excuse me he&amp;#39;s he&amp;#39;s my hero and uh I know that he&amp;#39;s an inspiration to many of the fa and he&amp;#39;s also a great symbol of Hope for a lot of the families in the caregivers out there his his motto which his mother hates is it&amp;#39;s not supposed to be easy and that kind of defines a lot of his uh physical challenges that he&amp;#39;s decided to overtake during the years as an example the notes I have for this speech are on the back of my vaccination card so that I can go to India to cycle with Kyle to the highest paved Road in the world 19,000 ft so Frederick&amp;#39;s a taxia does not define Kyle but I think it explains a lot of things um I think it&amp;#39;s brought out the best in him and I&amp;#39;m very proud to be able to introduce him as my son Kyle Bryant [Applause] all right does anyone else need to wipe the tears from their eyes over that one thank you Dad that was that was wonderful um you know I&amp;#39;m so proud that introduction was makes me really proud uh because we all know that many of the things about who we are are from our parents and I&amp;#39;m so proud of that so thank you Dad um and I&amp;#39;ve got to tell you that I&amp;#39;m fired up lately like be Beyond fired up that I&amp;#39;ve ever been before and it&amp;#39;s because of all of you it&amp;#39;s because of the momentum of the fa Community not only in research and Drug development yeah that momentum is going like crazy right now but also just people understanding that supporting each other is what makes this community and what moves us all forward this event is a prime example of that it&amp;#39;s all of us coming together incredible details that the Gars have thought of and bringing everyone together to support each other and to support treatments and a cure for fa so thank you so much to the gar family the delightful G family for putting all of this together I also do have to compliment Michael speech how incredibly powerful was that thank you so much Michael contributions to the fa Community come in all shapes and sizes and as my dad said on June 2 first we&amp;#39;re leaving the us to go to India we&amp;#39;re going to ride 200 miles from 11,000 ft up to 19,000 ft and some people would say like I&amp;#39;ve gotten this question a lot I feel like why why would you do that why do you need to go to the top of the highest p in the world and a lot of it is personal I want to be at the top of the highest paved Road knowing that I got there under my own power I want that from me but also this is how I contribute to the fa Community I love cycling I I love cycling probably more than anything in my life and to be able to say and to myself that I can use that to benefit the fa Community to get us all closer to the cure for fa I&amp;#39;m really really excited about that but you know the thing that gets me really fired up is seeing people in the community realize their value and realize that they can make an impact it doesn&amp;#39;t have to be cycling you don&amp;#39;t have to ride a trike or or a bike to contribute to the momentum of the community it&amp;#39;s playing music right how much money debris raised tonight let&amp;#39;s here for all the incredible progress you made so it&amp;#39;s playing music it&amp;#39;s participating in clinical trials making our voices heard on Capitol Hill and wherever it needs to be heard and it&amp;#39;s reaching out to each other and supporting each other through the through [Music] this incredibly difficult Journey but it&amp;#39;s so rewarding when we can support each other and realize our power to affect everybody in the community and move us all forward so thank you for getting me fired up and thank you to the G family for getting everyone together and getting us all closer to trement and care for fa thank you so [Applause] much so I&amp;#39;m not in your program because this is a surprise oh no it&amp;#39;s not you&amp;#39;ve been here before so um when you have a child with fa step back when we think of our lives for those of us who don&amp;#39;t have fa I think we would like to think of them as a nice smooth airplane ride you&amp;#39;re going down the runway and you take off when you&amp;#39;re born and you start to ride and you get higher and higher and it&amp;#39;s a controlled and it&amp;#39;s better and better and then you get to a cruising altitude and everything&amp;#39;s going and you have you you get a job and you have a family or whatever you choose to do with your life you do it and then if we if our dreams are met we retire we get spend time more time with family and slowly you know we&amp;#39;re we&amp;#39;re coming in for a landing and if everything goes the way we would dream it would go we would come into that smooth landing and would we would pass away and our family would would remember all the times that we had and that would be the way that we would envision our lives going for a parent to watch a child with fre it&amp;#39;s a tax here it&amp;#39;s more like watching somebody shot out of a cannon and your child is at first rising and rising and you think this is great this is you loved the child more than you loved anything in your life and you&amp;#39;re and and it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s and this is wonderful but then something&amp;#39;s off and you begin to detect this Arc that you did not expect and you go to doctors and you find this and you learn this and so forth and finally you realize your your child is now starting to fall and you don&amp;#39;t know what to do and you&amp;#39;re trying to figure this out and the child is struggling and you&amp;#39;re struggling and what you want is something somebody to throw your child a Lifeline get this child some help and so now through Farah we have an organization that has put together the basic research to find these technologies that have the potential to bring our kids to help our kids with this as they begin to fall in the off Arc we&amp;#39;re looking at between Farah and Fa research Labs which are here tonight and pharmaceutical companies which are here tonight they&amp;#39;re looking at Wing suits and parachutes and all different ways of helping our kids catch a lift and join us on the airplane and we will get there this is the part of the evening okay there&amp;#39;s still wine over there I was going to say the silent auction is closed

do me a flat feet but that wasn&amp;#39;t the issue so after they finally diagnosed me with Friedreich&amp;#39;s ataxia oh so you were just 11 at the time like that was that super young to be diagnosed with something so big as well I could just take a pill or do a surgery and everything would be better but reading about what Friedreich&amp;#39;s is and how most people with they end up in a

to swallow I can imagine and how did that kind of impact your parents as well because they must have been super scared my parents were absolutely destroyed by this they were really heartbroken by it they you know in some ways blame themselves for having the gene too bad so on yeah I totally do not blame them for not one me been known to all with children with their BAE that or any disorder that you are the ones who gave us life here the ones who helped us be able to enjoy the world to thrive and survive and you&amp;#39;re not we don&amp;#39;t blame you for whatever issues we may have to deal with yeah so it really just heard them to see me struggling to do things I was formerly able to do like play sports and you know keep up with all my other friends they it heard them to watch me struggle to keep up with them yeah and I&amp;#39;m like how did you climb a nice up because like when you obviously at like 11 it&amp;#39;s that age where you&amp;#39;re about to go into it being a teenager and things like that like how did you kind of relate to your friends still or did they drift away you know as a preteen was to fit in with everyone else oh yeah blend in with the grad but only I had this disorder that would that was affecting my um my dexterity and it may be clumsy pretty much hmm you know I couldn&amp;#39;t no longer just blend in I always feel like I had a spotlight on me whether I wanted better or not okay you know so it was an ongoing battle of panic you know I knew I was one to survive I just didn&amp;#39;t quite know how and it would take me a while to realize that for most i buda they as a stumbling-block as my way of not being able to reach as i had someone like to reach only recently with my job and with everything going on that FA are free drinks seems to me to be unnecessarily a roadblock or an impediment but part of who i am part of me that enables me to maybe be a little bit more in pathetic otherwise would be maybe to reach out to other it&amp;#39;s a little more deeply than i would be able to without it that&amp;#39;s incredible that all concepts of changing what you thought was a great evil to something that well still is not to be celebrated can definitely be seen to have benefits absolutely yeah quito is a little bit more about what Friedreich&amp;#39;s ataxia actually is and what it&amp;#39;s like to kind of have that you know something is really wrong with my legs hmm it&amp;#39;s a baby nerves do not communicate with my brain lady should so without that communication going that muscles tend to atrophy and be of disuse so that that&amp;#39;s a tag live I like believe it is all about frustration because um my brain says that my lathe in my arm that everything should be able to do a B and C should be able to do all of these everyday tasks and when I&amp;#39;m able to do that well when I do them a little a little bit off kilter it&amp;#39;s um it&amp;#39;s really hurtful it&amp;#39;s really aggravating yeah my head there&amp;#39;s no reason I shouldn&amp;#39;t be able to get up and go to the other room but my body softly so that is an incredible amount of frustration and it&amp;#39;s kind of um easy to see how in many cases that leads to negative thoughts about our own bodies I&amp;#39;ve I&amp;#39;ve been there but you have to I think I learned to be a little more compassionate toward your own body a knowledge that my body is doing the best I can you know it has this thing FA that makes the things more difficult for it but that&amp;#39;s the same with me you know I&amp;#39;m trying to do the best I can&amp;#39;t Eve you know fa is out there so yeah it&amp;#39;s not about hitting anything it&amp;#39;s about seeing the struggles your face and overcoming them absolutely yeah and I think you&amp;#39;ve had such an interest in journey as well so this cause kind of started when you were about eleven so leading up to where you are now dare I ask how old you are am I allowed I&amp;#39;m 34 first time I looked up the prognosis for FA it said um most people would if he&amp;#39;d die when they are 33 counts bad you&amp;#39;re gonna completely crush that that yeah you&amp;#39;re not just beat you&amp;#39;re not you can absolutely crush it thank you worry Wow so how did it feel to actually get that prognosis credibly you know you know probably let the depression in my deal with yeah I can imagine oh I think you&amp;#39;re amazing for carry on I&amp;#39;m going already do you want any treatments at the moment to kind of try to prolong life as much as possible or is it more of a like a symptom management day-to-day kind of thing Oh currently there are no official treatments so yeah it&amp;#39;s all symptomatic I have found like little things like if they can&amp;#39;t see the coughs I do things that prevent me from coughing image which is really interesting in this time a corona virus begins coughing is a really scary thing yeah yeah FA is there is no treatment for it it&amp;#39;s all set semantics right we&amp;#39;re getting close there man it&amp;#39;s in the works it&amp;#39;s in the works that&amp;#39;s good so before we go into part two what do you think would be your main tips for living well with with FA okay I have two things that I want to mention one is one they both are thinking that I&amp;#39;m still learning but the first is not adhere to a victim&amp;#39;s mindset to not CFA or whatever condition you may face or whatever thing is in your life that you wish weren&amp;#39;t in there hmm don&amp;#39;t let that be your jailer don&amp;#39;t let that be something hold your bag keeps you from being the person you want to be because it is not that you are so much more than whatever lives in your way and you have to see that and you can&amp;#39;t let yourself be victimized but whatever is in your way and say your thing I would say is always keep I&amp;#39;m not very physical so I did this in my head but always keep a list of what you can do when you were able to and who you are and what you love and he goes a to separate list and never confused that you never met who you are is defined by what you can do because that is a non behavior at all and that is a hard lesson we&amp;#39;re not still trying to learn and master but it is so true that&amp;#39;s amazing advice Matt thank you so much and enabled raise that&amp;#39;s it

    "transcript": "[Music] you are listening to the two disabled dudes podcast I&amp;#39;m Kyle Bryant and I&amp;#39;m Sean bombstar and together we are navigating life with disability hello world welcome to the podcast here here it is what do what do you think of the opening was that pretty good or what no I I think that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s a good way to to welcome every everybody yeah we&amp;#39;re we&amp;#39;re reaching out to the world here you know this this is our White Flag hey world come lesson White Flag are we giving up we&amp;#39;re surrendering no we&amp;#39;re just yeah I guess you&amp;#39;re right I don&amp;#39;t know what it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s not white anyway uh this is the podcast we are doing a podcast now um and I think that&amp;#39;s crazy partly because uh we are just kind of learning as we go we didn&amp;#39;t know what we were doing before like 4 months ago and we spent the last four months like just figuring out how to make it happen I I think that&amp;#39;s probably true though most things we do in our lives we don&amp;#39;t really know what we&amp;#39;re doing then we got to spend several months just figuring it out yeah yeah I mean it&amp;#39;s happened for us between us like you know three or four times before where I go hey Sean um I think we should ride our bikes to Las Vegas let&amp;#39;s do it yeah yeah exactly and that&amp;#39;s the response I get I didn&amp;#39;t even have a bike at that time do you remember that we sat down I&amp;#39;m pretty sure the restaurant was water boy or the one right next door Rubicon Rubicon yeah and and you we were talking about the ride tax c 2 back then they were numbers not necessarily designated event cities um and we were doing number two which was from Sacramento to Vegas number to like right attacked to not like number two yeah good point thank you um and you&amp;#39;re were like hey I&amp;#39;m going to do this Vegas let&amp;#39;s try to get some people and I&amp;#39;m like shoot I want to help but I don&amp;#39;t have a bike I better get one yeah yeah so that&amp;#39;s how it works I mean we uh neither of us knew any well I guess we knew a little bit because we&amp;#39;d both been on a guest on like a podcast before um but other than that we didn&amp;#39;t know anything about how to get it done true we we just knew we wanted to do one and we thought we might do okay doing one together so hopefully somebody else thinks that same thing yep yep that is the hope I hope um I hope more people are listening than just like my mom and your mom that&amp;#39;s you know well I&amp;#39;m sure your dad is listening too so that&amp;#39;s a bonus okay yeah and maybe uncle Steve hey Uncle [Laughter] Steve cool oh man all right so where did this come from how how uh how did we get started on this Kyle well so I um it really I was I was watching the movie the documentary that we&amp;#39;re both in and just realizing how much stuff is in there that just is sort of applicable to everyday life and you know partly it was just me wanting to discuss it and figure it out more and go a little bit deeper in some of the topics and I was like oh that would be good for a podcast and then somebody called me up or no emailed me and invited me on one of their podcasts and um and it went really well and I I was like you know what if they can do it I think Sean and I can do it and um so that&amp;#39;s kind of where it came from and I called you up on my way back from an event I was driving H with a handsfree headset so um trying to be safe in the car and uh you know we start talking and um theid we wanted to do and four months later here we are yeah hopefully this we we&amp;#39;re getting it all worked out you know there were a lot of things we had to figure out once we both decided that yeah yeah let&amp;#39;s do a podcast then you know the so many Logistics of do we have the right equipment your computer my computer what do we what do we really need to pull this thing off and I know you did a bunch of research online and really figured out that if we had halfway decent microphones we might be able to record a halfway decent conversation between the two of us yeah yeah and one thing that we should point out is um Sean is on the west coast and Kyle that&amp;#39;s me is on the east coast and so that&amp;#39;s really we had to figure that one out like what how are we going to record this when we&amp;#39;re not even in the same room and uh I think it&amp;#39;s working out so we got we got a Skype call going right now and um and that&amp;#39;s kind of how it&amp;#39;s working out so what do you hope to accomplish with this podcast Sean well you know I ultimately I hope to get rich and famous and if this is not really that&amp;#39;s not what you said before you know I I think with this podcast I just hope to be a voice of encouragement for a lot of people uh dealing with Fredrick&amp;#39;s taxi or other conditions and um you know obviously we&amp;#39;re both threatened with this shortterm life and I hope to be able to leave a positive Mark and contribute whatever I can and you know I jokingly said it not too long ago in uh a patient panel in Florida you and I were both there I think I a joking I said something like you know if if I had a million dollars to give I would but since I don&amp;#39;t have money money what can I do and part of my contribution is really just being available and sharing my experiences as I go and hopefully it it adds value to somebody else along the way yeah and I think you know a lot of it where it comes from is that you and I enjoy talking to each other um and we&amp;#39;re we&amp;#39;re comfortable talking about well I am anyway I hope I hope you are too I hope that&amp;#39;s a shared Comfort it is um talking about our our disease something that we share that not very many other people in the world share um and we love being able to feel comfortable talking about it and um you know I feel comfortable with you and lots of my other friends that have fa or other Progressive diseases depilating diseases and um and so just talking about it I think is um goes a long way in the conversation and I I hope that some other people feel Comfort hearing us talk about it too I guess um and maybe that&amp;#39;s you know and and that&amp;#39;s where the conversation starts and we hope that this podcast starts a few conversations to paint a correlation there&amp;#39;s so much I believe so much um it&amp;#39;s going to sound cliche but some power when you begin talking about things it doesn&amp;#39;t seem to have as much of a stronghold or grip on on your your mental energy or the way you&amp;#39;re pursuing life so I when you sit here and and you&amp;#39;d say things like talk about this condition or other things similar it reminds me of stories I&amp;#39;ve heard from you where it took you some time to get to a point where you were talking about your diagnosis and I am hoping that the more conversations like ours are available and out there it empowers other people to move along in their process and talk about things whether it&amp;#39;s the condition or certain symptoms or certain challenges they face every day yeah I think I mean I think you hit it right on you know and um like you said when I was first diagnosed I didn&amp;#39;t talk about it for a couple years um even with my close friends or family um I just didn&amp;#39;t know how and I just wasn&amp;#39;t emotionally prepared to do that I just wasn&amp;#39;t prepared to do that at age 17 and I think that you know my family was incredible because what my parents you know during the time when I wasn&amp;#39;t ready to talk about it they were going to support group meetings they were looking stuff up online and and and starting to discover all these things as hard as that was um to see the future of what this disease had in store for our family um you know when I was ready to talk about it they were prepared with at least the beginning of answers and you know at at the very least they knew where to find the answers we might be looking for um and so but you know when we started talking about it um that&amp;#39;s kind of a turning point in my life when I started facing up to this disease and facing this Challenge and being like all right here it is what are we going to do with it you know and the first step was just acknowledging it sure what do you what do you think this is a question I haven&amp;#39;t asked you before and I haven&amp;#39;t heard you talk on it but I know it took you two years to get to the point where you started to face it and talk about it why do you suppose it took you that long I know you were young emotionally a different place than maybe you are today but even the age of 17 what do you suppose is something or some of the reasons that kept you from from talking about it um I I I think I thought a lot of myself um you know I didn&amp;#39;t want to uh have a reason to think less of myself and hopefully maybe that&amp;#39;s something that a lot of people um hold in common but you know just uh facing the reality of the situation like I think we all have this vision for our lives right and to see that crumble and totally changing and trying to figure out how I&amp;#39;m going to handle that change um I just was not ready for that and I think I just delayed that facing that reality as as long as possible sure so tell us since since we already started this why you um will you tell us what began to happen in your life after those two years passed and you started talking about it so it started as soon as I could start talking about it um that&amp;#39;s when we that&amp;#39;s what allowed action I think to enter the picture uh when I was so scared to talk about it you know it was kind of paralyzing um and once I faced it and I realized I had so many so much support around me in my family and my friends I realized that I could do this and you know this isn&amp;#39;t going to totally crush me let&amp;#39;s do something about it let&amp;#39;s rethink the future rethink what this means for my life because it&amp;#39;s life is not over um which was definitely one thought that entered my mind and there&amp;#39;s a lot more life to live so let&amp;#39;s figure out what to do with it and the it that Kyle is talking about we&amp;#39;ll get into a little more detail here momentarily but Kyle said it and I think I did too Frederick&amp;#39;s Axia is the disease neuromuscular condition that Kyle and I have both been diagnosed with Kyle at the age of 17 me at the age of 25 and causes a whole bunch of damage to our entire body and threatens to end life early due to heart disease but um Kyle was really good at at explaining the science behind this disease so Kyle we to that in a minute but the it that we&amp;#39;re talking about what would you say um you know once you began to talk about it and like you said it it allowed for Action to enter the picture and begin to be a part of the journey what are some of the steps you you initially took um these are tough questions dude so I think really it began with just being able to think past fa and think past this huge insurmountable challenge that it seemed to be um and that&amp;#39;s when ideas started forming in my head with how am I going to respond to this challenge um and I think that&amp;#39;s really how it began like sort of just in my head being able to think about it and you know a few years later we started I started realizing that we need to take action and um so we did so I I looked online and I saw this guy who was about to circumnavigate the country on a tricycle he had Ms and he was standing next to his strike on this web page and I was reading about him and um I was like oh my gosh I think I can do that and uh so I started looking into it more and more and I found a trike dealer near where I was and I drove up there one weekend and I went for a test ride in the parking lot and I was like holy cow I can finally move under my own power I hadn&amp;#39;t I hadn&amp;#39;t walked very far for like several years and all of a sudden I could move down the street at um you know 20 mph if I wanted to under my own power and know I think I just started visualizing where it could take me and uh so in 2007 so my first bike ride was 7 miles and um I was so proud of myself I couldn&amp;#39;t believe I I had that I could do that and um and now I did 14 and 25 and then 50 and then um only 4 months after my first ride I went for a centry ride wow and um I was the last one on the road but I I finished it I did it it&amp;#39;s huge and from then on the sky was the limit sure so uh I decided to do a cross country bike ride um starting in San Diego my dad and I rode our bikes to Memphis Tennessee and my mom drove the support vehicle and it was an insane adventure and it was just the beginning we we finished this bike ride and we empowered ourselves and I was writing a Blog about every 3 days during that ride and um really the the ride started the the movement really started when people were responding to my blog posts with comments and being like hey this is awesome you know I really respect what you&amp;#39;re doing and it&amp;#39;s really encouraging me in my life um and seeing how art actions were affecting other people was really how the ride concept started and um you know over the next couple years we did two more longdistance bike rides and now I&amp;#39;m on staff at the friedrick at taxi a research Alliance and we have a series of bike rides across the country we have six our Network right now and um you know anyone is uh we have we have routes from 5 to 50 miles um and anyone is invited to come out and be empowered and push themselves and contribute to the cause um and so that that is the long and short of how it got started so when you talk about those rides and the contribution to the cause what is the what is the effect of those six different rides every every year today so uh so the the purpose is to raise money for research um a lot a lot more goes on um as far as connections between people and empowerment and awareness and stuff like that but um when we&amp;#39;re talking numbers the ride raises about $800,000 a year for fa research and um for the past several years we&amp;#39;ve had over 2,000 bar Spence wow that&amp;#39;s incredible and like I said there beyond the money those events are so incredible for fostering community and in empowering people to be involved and to you know take action like you said and they also it helps Foster growth and connection among that Community I know I&amp;#39;ve only been able to do a few of those rides myself but it&amp;#39;s the highlight of the spring at least for the Northern California ride because you get to see in and hang out with so many amazing people that we&amp;#39;ve come to know and meet and almost every year you meet a handful of new ones and it&amp;#39;s just an exciting thing to be a part of so uh for whatever it&amp;#39;s worth KY I&amp;#39;m glad you started riding your bike and I&amp;#39;m glad that I&amp;#39;ve been able to ride along with you for some of those event sorry I just kicked my microphone it it happens anyway I think it&amp;#39;s uh the bike the bike is really what&amp;#39;s helped you and I stay involved with each other but it&amp;#39;s the diagnosis that you and I that brought us together I was diagnosed in 2007 I was 25 and immediately got online and trying to learn a little more than what the doctor said over the course of about an hour so I went home that night I was just playing around on the internet keyword searching all over and Kyle that ride AC Ross the country that you mentioned you had just done it two or 3 months prior and since we were from the same city or we are from the same area uh you were all over my local news you know the Sacramento be and different news channels so on Google it had all the stuff showing up and I&amp;#39;m like oh why is why is local news talking about this sky and the spike R so the more I read and dug the more I realized that you and I were the same age that were from the same city and you were diagnosed and living with the same disease that I had just learned about that day so at some point over the course of a few days I think I tracked down some sort of email address for you shot out an email and tried to meet and connect with Kyle and find out okay what what can you tell me what am I up against knowing that somebody else was in the area with the same diagnos and I think it was just 3 weeks later or maybe two weeks that we met for a pizza and a beer Down Town Sacramento yeah man I I remember that and um I just remember being feeling empowered because just there&amp;#39;s somebody else like you know I think that&amp;#39;s one of the tough things specifically with a rare disease and with the fa you know fa is is 1 in 50,000 people as you know Sean and um that&amp;#39;s about 5,000 people in the US and so you know when most people that are not involved in the fa Community if they&amp;#39;re listening right now they&amp;#39;ve probably never heard the words fried&amp;#39;s a taxi before um and so when you&amp;#39;re first diagnosed you feel so alone and isolated and just to have someone to talk to about it like we were saying before maybe I&amp;#39;m repeating myself but um you know that that meeting over beers was just to have someone to have a beer with and understand what um what you&amp;#39;re going through was was incredible you know I think it&amp;#39;s funny that we mentioned beer because one of the symptoms of Frederick&amp;#39;s attx is this total gate distribution so it causes us to have a lack of of control and balance control of our muscles especially legs and arms and of course a a destroyed sense of balance and a slurred speech you can probably hear it in our talk today so really it&amp;#39;s symptomatic of being incredibly inebriated and I remember being at the restaurant and back then I I was a good boy and I didn&amp;#39;t really drink much of anything and I remember you had ordered a beer and I was I still hadn&amp;#39;t experienced too many symptoms but I the doctor told me about them and I read all about them and I experienced them to some degree I remember asking you specifically if it was okay for you to have that beer or if it was going to make things worse for you yep because even then I didn&amp;#39;t know the effects of it yeah yeah and um of course you know it does make things worse um if if you&amp;#39;re talking about the physical symptoms sure um and of course that&amp;#39;s only temporary but um you know so it is absolutely to be used in moderation and um you know uh with a certain amount of perspective and um respect but you know it&amp;#39;s not it&amp;#39;s not going to kill you yeah it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s not well like I said it&amp;#39;s good to knowe that the the heightened symptoms of or yeah the heightened uh effect is just temporary it&amp;#39;s not it&amp;#39;s not going to cause any permanent damage right just and so because you drink so um I think we should probably let our listeners know um and point out specifically that um we&amp;#39;re not drunk right now right Sean I mean I guess I&amp;#39;m 3,000 mil away from you so and I can&amp;#39;t see beyond the uh your computer screen so you could be drunk but anyway uh I one of one of the symptoms you know so fa affects all muscle coordination from the toes to the fingertips um and a group of those muscles are muscles we use to talk um and so that&amp;#39;s why we sound like we&amp;#39;re drunk we haven&amp;#39;t been drinking um but uh that&amp;#39;s why we sound like it so um the genetics of fa so DNA is a series of codes and one of those codes is GAA um most of the general public has less than 30 repeats of GAA at that code in their DNA I have 400 50 some of our friends with fa have over a th000 up to like 1,500 repeats of GAA in their DNA when that code gets decoded it makes a protein called Freight taxin I don&amp;#39;t make enough fre taxin Sean doesn&amp;#39;t make enough fre taxon all of our friends with fa they lack fre taxon and um so that is the thing that causes dysfunction it causes um things like extreme um uh fatigue chronic fatigue and um you know third speech uh uh balance of coordination issues and vision loss hearing loss and life shortening heart complications unfortunately hard complications are the thing the the leading cause of death for somebody with fa and um so this is uh uh you know a life and death situ situation we&amp;#39;re we&amp;#39;re talking about so when we&amp;#39;re raising funds and awareness and stuff um you know people see me or they see you and they&amp;#39;re like what&amp;#39;s the big deal like you&amp;#39;re in a wheelchair yeah that&amp;#39;s a bummer and your speech is a little slurred um you know but when they&amp;#39;re looking at me or you that person is not seeing the total devastation of this disease and it affects other people much more severely um you know and that&amp;#39;s what we are working to um to reverse and um so a little more about fa um how it&amp;#39;s inherited which is a common question is so it&amp;#39;s a double recessive trait so I got one bad genene from Mom and one bad genene from Dad but they had no idea because they had no symptoms I had a 25% chance of receiving receiving both of their um recessive jeans and I was the lucky recipient same same thing with Sean too so um it&amp;#39;s inherited the same way and um so like I mentioned before that&amp;#39;s 150,000 people that is affected by fa um but the alarming thing is that one in 100 people are carriers and uh it just takes two carriers that don&amp;#39;t know that they are carriers to get together and then um their child has a 25% chance of of getting fa when when they&amp;#39;re born so um and it&amp;#39;s a progressive disease as well I think that&amp;#39;s something to uh understand um so I mean I&amp;#39;ve I&amp;#39;ve had it and Sean has had it um our whole lives but for me I didn&amp;#39;t know until I was 17 sha I think you were like 26 right 25 25 so um and as we get older the disease gets worse and um as of now there is no treatment or cure um but that&amp;#39;s what we&amp;#39;re working to change we&amp;#39;ve got lots of shots on goal in research and um and Drug trials Sean you just were you actually at UCLA in the trial today uh I was I flew home today but the trial that I am a part of um all of my assessments ended last night so um yeah I did just come back today although I didn&amp;#39;t have any appointments this morning just a flight home okay so yeah like I said there&amp;#39;s you know with no cure or treatment at this time there there are so many amazing efforts right now moving the needle forward and in the pipeline to help effectively stop or cure this condition and it&amp;#39;s exciting to to be around it to be a part of it and to help the process for me one of the one of the coolest things that I look at when I&amp;#39;m able to you know like I said in the beginning of the conversation I don&amp;#39;t have millions to give but what I do have is time to chat with you like we are right now but then also I&amp;#39;m I&amp;#39;m happy to sort of volunteer my body so to speak to these trials because the way I see it whether whether this particular trial that I&amp;#39;m doing right now or that particular drug over there over here has a positive effect it has an effect that helps us move forward because either it tells us yes we&amp;#39;re on the right track let&amp;#39;s keep moving in that direction or no the answer isn&amp;#39;t that way let&amp;#39;s go this way now and whatever the answer is for me it&amp;#39;s just it&amp;#39;s uh exciting to be a part of that part of that process to move us toward a cure I don&amp;#39;t know if that made sense yeah it totally makes sense and it it really brings up an opportunity for me to talk about Farah the Frederick&amp;#39;s ATT taxi our research Alliance um I&amp;#39;m on staff at Farah and we are the largest fun of fa research in the world um and we fund a lot of seed grants that help scientists get um much larger grants from bigger organizations like the NIH but really we um we encourage research all over the world and work with other um sister organizations just like us as well in other countries and um develop ideas and work with Scientists to make connections that really keep the research going and um one of the principles you talked about be just now was that you know if something doesn&amp;#39;t work then we go a different direction right and um you know the the principle phah research pipeline is very deep and diverse and we have eight or nine different ways to approach the disease and within those different approaches there are several different projects going on and so we know that we have to have many shots on goal or many egg eggs and manyi baskets whatever uh whatever metaphor you want to use but many pucks on the ice yeah there you go pucks on the ice I think I made that up all right maybe we can maybe we can do an episode a little later down the road where all we do is think of different metaphors for that um approach all right sweet so uh anyway that is Farah and um you know we really facilitate research like I said with lots of different partners um including you know government Partners farmer Partners Lab Partners scientific Partners um you know International other International organizations and really you know with one main focus of treating and curing frick it taxia and really um it all stems from well a lot of it you know we have a strong culture of focus and collaboration and really that is led by our co-founder and president Ron BK um he&amp;#39;s just an amazing human being who really survives off of like smiles and hugs and um really you know any group he&amp;#39;s in he promotes collaboration over everything else and um you know everyone in the organization and everyone that knows him knows that he stands for collaboration and everyone follows when they&amp;#39;re when they&amp;#39;re around him and so um thank you to Ron Park but also you know just that I really come to know that that is so important just focus and um in principles and everyone on the same page in our organization we have an amazing board of directors and we have a really strong mission and vision that everyone really adheres to and looks at and keeps it in mind in everything we&amp;#39;re doing and um it&amp;#39;s just I feel very fortunate to be working for Farah and to be in the community that that we are both in you know there&amp;#39;s a part of me I just think yeah you&amp;#39;re super cool you have a cool job I B groceries for living uh whatever but anyway there&amp;#39;s a part of me Kyle that uh really I I think you have a great job and I love the the part you get to play in the organization and I&amp;#39;m not going to lie I um I send a letter and a petition to Ron every March asking him to replace you with me whoa okay that&amp;#39;s not true I&amp;#39;ve never done that although I J said something to Jennifer Farmer once the the fact that you even said that that makes me a little concerned man I need to step up my game or maybe a Farah just needs to open a West Coast office so I can get involved there all right all things to work on right well I think it&amp;#39;s cool and I love that you shared so much about phah because at the end of the day no matter what we&amp;#39;re doing or no matter what the day job is or our level of progression or our level of ability all things said and done like I said Farah is the leading organization worldwide leading the efforts in battling this condition so it&amp;#39;s an exciting organization to be connected to to be related to uh to help with and to do whatever we can to move the needle forward which like you mentioned this um drug trial I&amp;#39;m doing right now is facilitated because of organizations or really because of Farah so um even though I&amp;#39;m not on staff I&amp;#39;m happy to be connected to him and be a part of the community and whatever whatever capacity I can be awesome um so a little earlier I talked about collaboration and um you know we&amp;#39;re part of a of a much bigger Community as well Sean and and um so fa affects one in 50,000 that&amp;#39;s about 5,000 people in the US um the the definition of a rare disease in the US is a disease that now has a population of less than 200,000 people um and we you know fa has 5,000 people so that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s pretty rare and um but if we consider ourselves in the group of rare diseases in general all these diseases that have a population of less than 2,200,000 that&amp;#39;s 7,000 different diseases and that means there&amp;#39;s 25 million people in the US that have a rare disease um and that makes our numbers a little more powerful I think and so a lot of the work that Farah does is collaborating with other rare disease organizations and doing work on behalf of all rare diseases cuz really we&amp;#39;re on this together and and we&amp;#39;re all after the same thing you know uh a treatment and a cure for for our specific disease MH that&amp;#39;s true I think you also make it&amp;#39;s a good point and also helps tie in really part of the reason why you and I are doing this podcast sure we want to call attention to Frederick&amp;#39;s attack here we want to help raise awareness but it goes beyond that particular disease itself which is really what I think help bring you and I together and we have the thing the same thought process of making the most out of life while we can simply because we can and really part of the reason why we&amp;#39;re even having these conversations together is to help encourage people people in the world to do the same whether they&amp;#39;re up against Fredrick&amp;#39;s ATT taxia or Huntington or Ms or cancer or whatever the issue is there&amp;#39;s still so much more life than just that condition or just that disease and I think you you made a great Point earlier when you asked the question Kyle what can I do in spite of it or what can I do with this in mind how can I still take action even though I&amp;#39;m living with with this condition and that&amp;#39;s really a part of the reason why you and I are having this conversation um today and every other day that we record yep yeah and yeah and to have this conversation and include so many other people that have you know a similar mindset I think is it&amp;#39;s one of the things I&amp;#39;m excited about I mean this is our first episode and I&amp;#39;m just excited to see what happens really and just to to hope that these conversations are just the beginning of of hopefully what might be absolutely then it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s good I was just thinking we&amp;#39;re we&amp;#39;re definitely going to have to bring on some other people because I don&amp;#39;t know that we&amp;#39;re going to be that effective just you and I we&amp;#39;re we&amp;#39;re going to need some other value adding folks to to to jump in on the conversation with us yeah yeah we talked about it Sean and you know we&amp;#39;re going to bring in some people who are perhaps experts on clinical trials um adaptive supports um adoptive equipment maybe you know um a lot of different topics I think we&amp;#39;re definitely going to try to um bring in people who know a lot more than you are I do about these all the stuff that we want to talk about for sure I think it&amp;#39;s also it seems to me a perfect and natural time to uh a say welcome again to all of our listeners today and then B invite you to come along for the conversation and get involved you can find us online at to disabled does.com connect with K and I on Facebook or Instagram or whatever platform you enjoy the most and let us know what Kyle and I can bring to the conversation that might be helpful or useful for you if you have questions or thoughts or comments or suggestions or sponsor ideas so we can make millions whatever it may be um we just invite you to to hang out with us and to keep giving us some input to make this better and effective I couldn&amp;#39;t have said it better myself um Sean this has been awesome I&amp;#39;m really excited for the podcast and uh thank you for the conversation today absolutely this is a great one and you know before we sign off there are probably a couple people we want to say thank you to before before we wrap this up what do you think Kyle I think of one lady in particular that really helped us get to where we&amp;#39;re at today and she&amp;#39;s she&amp;#39;s a friend of yours and you brought her to the table so I&amp;#39;ll let you talk about her for a minute yeah Lindsay roor um really helped us put together um the vision for this podcast and really helped us get on track with finding our voice and trying to make sure that this is not our only episode um you know planning for the future and making sure we can um execute into the future so um thank you Lindsay for getting us started yes absolutely thank you Lindsay and then I I don&amp;#39;t know if we&amp;#39;ve mentioned it I guess we haven&amp;#39;t mentioned it before this is episode number one or the introduction to two disabled dudes podcast but Kyle and I have a mutual friend who&amp;#39;s also living with Frederick&amp;#39;s a taxia jake

    "transcript": "imagine a world where a diagnosis doesn&amp;#39;t mean an end but a beginning a world where the fear of losing control over your body doesn&amp;#39;t Loom over your head a world where friedes attacks you or fa is not an unbeatable foe welcome to that world breaking news after years of Relentless research tireless trials and countless challenges our scientists have finally hit a breakthrough a new treatment for freed Dr sat taxia is here a treatment that promises to change lives to bring hope to bring a chance to fight back stay tuned as we delve deeper into this groundbreaking development but first let&amp;#39;s take a step back and understand what freed sat taxia is all about have you heard about fredri sat taxia or fa for short if not it&amp;#39;s okay it&amp;#39;s a term that&amp;#39;s not common in everyday conversation but for those affected by it it&amp;#39;s a daily reality Freed&amp;#39;s at taxia or fa as we&amp;#39;ll call it from here on out is a rare and Progressive disease it&amp;#39;s a silent enemy that gradually damages the nervous system and causes loss of muscle control over time now you may be wondering what causes this condition well fa is caused by a malfunctioning Gene this Gene known as the fraxin gene or fxn is responsible for the functioning of nerve cells when fxn doesn&amp;#39;t work as it should it can lead to a whole host of problems one of them being fa but how can we know for sure if someone has fa thanks to modern medicine fa can be confirmed through a genetic test that includes a fredri Ataxia repeat expansion analysis this test looks for specific changes in the fxn gene that are indicative of fa as with many Progressive diseases the severity of fa can be measured for fa this is done using the modified freed Dr taxia rating scale or MF fars this scale helps doctors to understand how the disease is progressing and to make informed decisions about treatment living with fa is a journey and for most individuals with this Condition it&amp;#39;s a journey that will eventually lead to the use of a wheelchair typically this happens around 10 to 15 years after being diagnosed enter Sky Claris a Beacon of Hope for those affected by fa this is the first drug specifically designed to treat friedrik at taxia a leap forward in a long and arduous Journey it&amp;#39;s as if we&amp;#39;ve been walking in the dark and suddenly a light has appeared on the horizon Sky Claris is not just another medication it&amp;#39;s a true GameChanger but what makes it so special let&amp;#39;s delve a little deeper its active ingredient works on a molecular level targeting the malfunctioning F taxin Gene the culprit behind fa this Gene when functioning correctly plays a crucial role in the functioning of nerve cells but in FA patients this Gene is out of whack leading to Progressive damage to the nervous system and loss of muscle control Sky Claris enters the scene by focusing on this faulty Gene it doesn&amp;#39;t merely treat the symptoms it goes straight to the root cause this is what sets Sky Claris apart from other treatments it&amp;#39;s like having a specialist locksmith when you&amp;#39;re dealing with a stubborn lock the locksmith doesn&amp;#39;t just oil the lock or attempt to force it open they understand the intricacies of the locks mechanism and work to fix the actual problem let&amp;#39;s be clear though skylaris is not a cure but it&amp;#39;s a significant advancement in managing the symptoms of fa it&amp;#39;s like having a reliable car when you&amp;#39;re on a long and challenging Journey the car might not eliminate the distance you have to travel but it certainly makes the journey more bearable it&amp;#39;s about enhancing the quality of life about giving fa patients a fighting chance against this Relentless disease it&amp;#39;s important to remember that every medication comes with its own set of prerequisites and guidelines Sky Claris is no different before embarking on this treatment Journey it&amp;#39;s crucial to have a clear and open discussion with your healthc care provider about all your medical conditions and current medications although it&amp;#39;s not a cure Sky Claris is a significant step in managing the symptoms of fa it&amp;#39;s the dawn of a new era a time of Hope and possibilities so let&amp;#39;s Embrace this development and continue our journey towards a future where fa is nothing more than a distant memory but who exactly can benefit from Sky Claris let&amp;#39;s Dive Right into that shall we Sky Claris is not a one-size fits-all medication it&amp;#39;s a targeted treatment specifically designed for individuals who are grappling with freed sat taxia a rare and Progressive disease that reeks havoc on the nervous system and grad ually erodes muscle control so the first and foremost requirement for eligibility is a confirmed diagnosis of Freed&amp;#39;s Ataxia this confirmation typically comes through a genetic test such as the fredri Ataxia repeat expansion analysis now just because someone has fredri at taxia doesn&amp;#39;t automatically make them eligible there are other factors to consider and this is where the role of healthc care providers becomes so crucial they need to evaluate the patient&amp;#39;s overall health status status the severity of their FA measured using the modified freed Dr taxia rating scale or M fars and the potential risks and benefits of starting the treatment remember Sky Claris is a powerful medication and like all powerful medications it needs to be handled with care each individual&amp;#39;s body is unique and what works for one person may not necessarily work for another certain medical conditions or medications could interact with Sky Claris potentially leading to adverse effects so before starting Sky Claris it&amp;#39;s essential to have a comprehensive discussion with your healthc care provider be open about your medical history current health status and any medications or supplements you&amp;#39;re currently taking your healthc care provider can then make an informed decision about whether Sky Claris is the right choice for you or not in conclusion while Sky Claris is a Beacon of Hope for those battling freed Dres of taxia it&amp;#39;s not a decision to be made lightly or without professional guidance remember it&amp;#39;s crucial to inform your healthcare provider about all your medical conditions and medications before taking Sky Claris so what are the benefits of Sky Claris you may ask well let&amp;#39;s delve into that Sky Claris is the first drug made specifically for the treatment of friedes sat taxia it&amp;#39;s a groundbreaking achievement a Beacon of Hope for those living with fa it&amp;#39;s not a cure but it&amp;#39;s a significant step towards managing this challenging disease the active ingredient in Sky Claris is designed to Target the malfunctioning PR taxin Gene which is the root cause of fa by addressing the root cause Sky Claris helps to slow down the progression of the disease this means that the loss of muscle control a key symptom of fa can be managed better but the benefits of Sky Claris go beyond just managing the symptoms it&amp;#39;s about improving the quality of life it&amp;#39;s about giving back some level of Independence about making the everyday activities a bit easier think about it the ability to do simple tasks like holding a cup of coffee or brushing your teeth without assistance can make a world of difference to someone living with fa moreover Sky Claris can potentially delay the need for a wheelchair a reality that most individuals with fa face about 10 to 15 years after diagnosis every additional year of mobility of being able to move around on your own is a year gained in the battle against fa and then there&amp;#39;s the psychological aspect living with a progressive disease can be mentally challenging the knowledge that there&amp;#39;s a medication specifically designed to manage your condition can provide a psychological boost a sense of hope and hope my friends can be a powerful medicine in itself however it&amp;#39;s important to remember that every individual is unique and so is their response to medication what works for one may not work for the other therefore the suitability of Sky Claris should always be discussed with a healthc care provider Sky Claris while not a cure can make a significant difference in the lives of those living with fa it&amp;#39;s about managing the disease improving the quality of life and fostering hope and sometimes that&amp;#39;s all we need to keep going like any medication Sky Claris comes with potential side effects it&amp;#39;s crucial to be aware of these so you can monitor your health while on the treatment and ensure you&amp;#39;re making the most informed decisions about your care firstly Sky Claris can cause increased liver enzymes this might not cause any symptoms but it can be detected through blood tests so regular checkups with your doctor are essential to keep an eye on this the next potential side effect is headaches these can range from mild to severe and while they may be a common part of life for many of us if you notice a significant increase after starting Sky Claris it&amp;#39;s definitely something to discuss with your doctor nausea and stomach pain are also potential side effects of Sky Claris these can be particularly uncomfortable but there are often strategies and additional medications that can help manage these symptoms tiredness is another side effect to look out for it&amp;#39;s not just the ordinary end of the day fatigue it&amp;#39;s a more profound feeling of exhaustion that doesn&amp;#39;t improve with rest diarrhea can also occur with Sky Claris while it can be inconvenient it&amp;#39;s crucial to stay hydrated If you experience this side effect lastly muscle pain is a potential side effect this isn&amp;#39;t the good type of ache you get after a workout but rather a persistent discomfort that doesn&amp;#39;t seem to go away these are the known potential side effects but as Sky Claris is a relatively new drug there could be others yet to be discovered this isn&amp;#39;t to scare you but to keep you informed everyone&amp;#39;s body reacts differently to medications and it&amp;#39;s possible that you may experience side effects not listed here it&amp;#39;s important to report any side effects to your doctor promptly they can help manage these side effects or adjust the treatment plan if necessary remember your health and well-being are the top priority as we wrap up let&amp;#39;s summarize what we&amp;#39;ve learned today we&amp;#39;ve dived deep into the world of freed drk ATT Taxi or fa a rare and Progressive disease that damages the nervous system resulting in loss of muscle control over time this condition is caused by a malfunctioning frat taxin Gene that affects the functioning of nerve cells a fact that can be confirmed through a genetic test known as fredri at taxia repeat expansion analysis we then explored the long arduous Journey scientists and researchers have embarked on to find a cure for this debilitating condition although a definitive cure remains elusive their tireless efforts have resulted in the development of a promising treatment Sky Claris we learned that Sky Claris is the first drug engineered specifically for the treatment of fa it&amp;#39;s a unique medical breakthrough but like any medication it&amp;#39;s not for everyone there are certain qualifications that one must meet to be eligible for this drug and it&amp;#39;s crucial to discuss its suitability with a healthc care provider we also looked at the benefits that Sky Claris offers while it may not be a cure it has the potential to significantly improve the quality of life for those living living with fa however it&amp;#39;s essential to keep in mind that every medication has potential side effects with Sky Claris these could include increased liver enzymes headaches nausea stomach pain fatigue diarrhea and muscle pain it&amp;#39;s of utmost importance to inform your healthcare provider about all medical conditions and medications before starting Sky Claris any side effects should be reported promptly and certain precautions should be taken while on this medication we hope this overview has given you a clearer understanding of fa and the role of Sky Claris in managing this condition remember knowledge is power the more we know and understand about fa the better prepared we are to support those affected by it and advocate for continued research and development in this field thank you for joining us on this journey to understand fa and Sky Claris better please share this video with anyone you feel May benefit from this information until next time take care",

    "transcript": "friedrich&amp;#39;s ataxia is a disorder where there&amp;#39;s impaired mitochondrial function that results in damage to various organ systems in particular the nervous system gets damaged which causes ataxia where the muscles cannot be moved in a coordinated way the disorder also affects other organs like the heart and pancreas the disease gets its name from the german physician nicolaus friedrich who first described the disease over 150 years so normally on chromosome 9 there&amp;#39;s a gene called the fxn gene that encodes a mitochondrial protein called frataxin the normal amount of frataxin varies by tissue with some tissues like the nervous system pancreas and heart containing lots of it frataxin helps put together cofactors called iron sulfur clusters it is a combination of iron and sulfur that form part of enzymes with many functions such as electron transfer which is a key part of mitochondrial atp production friedreich&amp;#39;s ataxia is caused by a mutation in the fxn gene where there&amp;#39;s an abnormal repetition of a gaa sequence within that gene this is called a triplet repeat or trinucleotide repeat which means that a group of three dna nucleotides is repeated multiple times in a row in this case guanine adenine and adenine normally the gaa sequence is repeated 7 to 34 times within the fxn gene but in friedrichs ataxia there is a repeat expansion where there are 100 to 1 700 times as many copies with most individuals having repeats ranging from 600 to 1200 times now friedrichs ataxia is inherited as an autosomal recessive condition it&amp;#39;s passed on by parents who are carriers because they have one expanded fxn gene and one normal fxn gene but they don&amp;#39;t have any symptoms of friedreich&amp;#39;s ataxia they end up passing on their expanded fxn genes to their kid inheriting both copies of the fxn gene with an expanded gaa repeat is the most common way to get friedrichs ataxia the repeat expansion causes gene silencing which is when the fxn gene is not transcribed normally and very little frataxin protein is made with low levels of frataxin the mitochondria are unable to efficiently incorporate iron into iron sulfur clusters and as a result there is lower mitochondrial atp production so there&amp;#39;s less energy available for the cell furthermore iron accumulates inside the mitochondria which reacts with oxygen to create unstable oxygen radicals over time these free radicals damage dna and proteins in the cells in a process called oxidative damage then this energy deficiency and oxidative damage result in dysfunction and death of the cells that are highly dependent on mitochondrial function such as neurons cardiomyocytes and pancreatic beta cells the loss of neurons leads to ataxia the ataxia usually begins in childhood which causes them to have difficulty in walking they might have some muscle weakness and loss of proprioception which is the sense of your position in space relative to other objects usually it affects the legs and then moves up to the torso a generalized feeling of fatigue is also common eventually most people with friedrichs ataxia need a wheelchair to get around the diagnosis of friedrichs ataxia is established by genetic testing this test is used to identify the expanded gaa repeat in both copies of the fxn gene the most common cause of friedrichs ataxia additional tests may be performed to help determine the extent of the disease such as an mri of the brain and spinal cord",

    "transcript": "ready as we&amp;#39;re gonna get my name is Christopher and I&amp;#39;m Gunner&amp;#39;s father I&amp;#39;m Christy I&amp;#39;m Gunner&amp;#39;s mom um our son has Frederick&amp;#39;s ataxia we don&amp;#39;t know much about it we&amp;#39;re making this to help Enlighten some of our friends some of our families and also for anyone else who may have a child in this situation we&amp;#39;ve been told that having a six-year-old being diagnosed with this is extremely rare and I continue it&amp;#39;s extremely difficult because of the unknowns there are a lot of unknowns a lot of questions a lot of what ifs and frankly we feel like we don&amp;#39;t have many answers to that so we feel as if we document our journey a little bit it may help some of the other people out there along your Journeys with your families it may bring you some peace and we&amp;#39;ve so far been unable to capture for our own selves um I&amp;#39;ll start by telling Gunner&amp;#39;s story when he was in I guess got her story leading to the diagnosis when he was in pre-k his teacher brought it to my attention that he had a nervous shake when he went to cut paper as a mom you don&amp;#39;t really think much about it you think they&amp;#39;re developing hand-eye coordination you think they&amp;#39;re just learning how to cut they&amp;#39;re learning how to write this is all what this is for so I just kind of let it slide this past year Gunner was in kindergarten and his teacher brought it to my attention again so I kind of thought okay if two teachers are bringing it to my attention it&amp;#39;s a little bit more than hand-eye coordination Goddard has always had allergy problems sinus problems we&amp;#39;ve had tubes his adenoids have been removed he is congested three weeks out of the month it&amp;#39;s a constant nose pour I always thought okay he&amp;#39;s unbalanced because of all the issues with his sinus and allergy and things like that well after the kindergarten teacher brought it to our attention we decided that it would be best to contact his pediatrician and see you know what she thought about it so we went to the pediatrician she you know we love her to death she&amp;#39;s a great person great doctor she&amp;#39;s always put Gunner first um and she did exactly what we asked her to we got it she got us an appointment with a neurologist um we went to the neurologist in December of 22. and he did some testing on Gunner just basic watching him walk watching him run right things like that and um we weren&amp;#39;t really given any potential prognosis of what it might be they wanted us to do a DNA kit because they frankly didn&amp;#39;t have an idea whatsoever per the conversation we had when we were there well in all honesty they didn&amp;#39;t really lead on that anything could be wrong it was more like it&amp;#39;s okay we&amp;#39;re just gonna check just you know for the fun of it and I guess about a month later we were home that day from school and the nurse called and said that the doctor would like for us to come in to discuss the test results and you know your first instinct is to ask is everything okay and you know they&amp;#39;re going to tell you they can&amp;#39;t tell you that it&amp;#39;s not okay or if it is okay and the scheduling was just off we couldn&amp;#39;t ever get a day that she could get me in where he was there I mean we were willing to come at any time but it was like every day I spit out there was something that wasn&amp;#39;t able the doctor wasn&amp;#39;t able to accommodate so for some reason I just said can we come that day I mean she&amp;#39;s like absolutely and this was 10 o&amp;#39;clock in the morning we threw clothes on as we were about to walk out the door she called and said I&amp;#39;m sorry the doctor is scheduled that time off for a certain reason well being frustrated I just said can he just call just have him call me because it&amp;#39;s no big deal just tell us over the phone and it was a Friday I&amp;#39;m not spending the weekend wondering what could happen on Monday and so the doctor calls and I mean I remember it vividly we&amp;#39;re in Sam&amp;#39;s and he calls and he tells me my son has muscular dystrophy and it was a gut punch um I asked him if it was severe his answer was there is no severe well I guess in a Mother&amp;#39;s Eyes at this point Gunner was not severe and to wear a wheelchair is severe to me and then I said is are we looking at a wheelchair and he just said you know I can&amp;#39;t really tell you yes or no on that and I get it and after that we you know we came home and we had emotions and we cried and we would watch our son run around the yard and believe that there&amp;#39;s no way that our child has this there&amp;#39;s just no way that this is what&amp;#39;s going to consume him to get news like that over a phone call when you&amp;#39;re walking through a department store I&amp;#39;m there&amp;#39;s no way to capably be able to handle that correctly there&amp;#39;s nowhere to process it where we were in a public place I think the only thing that we did was we got out of there as quick as we could just so we could process like she said we the emotional difficulties that came with that conversation are just I don&amp;#39;t even care to recall them and I hope no one else have to ever experience well I immediately picked up the phone and I called Texas I guess we can say yeah we call Texas Children&amp;#39;s um and you know of course I&amp;#39;d already explained to her I&amp;#39;ve seen a neurologist I have test results please don&amp;#39;t make me start at the bottom we can&amp;#39;t do that again um we want to go straight to the source of where we need to be and I will tell you that lady was an angel send she did exactly what I needed her to do she got on the phone she made calls she got the referrals for us all set up in place um I sent her over the test results and I guess it was about a week later she called back and she asked us to come in to see their neurologist and so we get there and um well I guess we need to back up I&amp;#39;m sorry when I took him to go see the pediatrician to kind of discuss the diagnosis of muscular dystrophy um we get it people are human people make mistakes people the phone call was not the right way to give us a diagnosis like this and with the diagnosis like this and the other thing that really upset us too is the doctor the way he presented it was as we thought yes his exact words were as we fought it&amp;#39;s muscular dystrophy well like and that was completely out of the clear blue for us we were given no precursor warning the doctor when we were in the office never mentioned anything along those lines and so that was one of the reasons that made it so emotionally difficult had we had some sort of a warning today we&amp;#39;re looking it could be something like this along the lines of it I&amp;#39;m sure it would have still been very difficult to accept [Music] and as was it was just so out of the clear blue we couldn&amp;#39;t believe that those were the results because obviously being parents being this day and age we live in the very first thing you do is run to your phone and start looking up internet things on this prognosis and it wasn&amp;#39;t lining up for what we saw he was not supposed to be highly intelligent if he had that he is extremely highly intelligent he just he looked down the list and the symptoms did not add up to what our son is and so we needed some further guidance and suffering through it all weekend I mean our world collapsed for an entire weekend and she jumped on the phone Christy jumped on the phone immediately and got got a doctor&amp;#39;s appointment that Monday we went in to talk to our pediatrician and I just I really wanted some kind of guidance I didn&amp;#39;t know where do we start because you know as parents you fight you fight for your children and you do what you&amp;#39;ve got to do to get on the help they need and she came in and again she&amp;#39;s our favorite we love her to death and she just you know she&amp;#39;s just said for one I&amp;#39;m going to tell you I would have never saw this coming and she sat down and she read the results and she read the blood test and she read the results and she read the blood test and actually not just her but another doctor there that knew us as well so we had two doctors that actually knew us knew our family personally that read over the results numerous times and said they don&amp;#39;t see it all they could see is that Gunner was a carrier of muscular dystrophy which means he has the Gene and that if he ever had decided to have children and if it was his wife and his choice they could be tested if the mother had the gene the gene could mutate we were super relieved super relief but at the same time we still wanted that extra everything is okay yeah again as a parent once you&amp;#39;re told something&amp;#39;s wrong with your child you don&amp;#39;t just leave it wide open everything&amp;#39;s gonna be okay moving forward you need that final the finality to it what is this how do I overcome this what do we need to do for our kid to make our kid okay and so that&amp;#39;s when we went to Texas Children&amp;#39;s looking for more answers looking for more definitive answers at that to what we needed to do moving forward what our son actually had again we were still thinking it was probably like a neurological tick or something like that that was going to need some physical therapy something minor but nothing major and even going to Texas Children&amp;#39;s the first time I got a very warm feeling the hospital is phenomenal please do not get us wrong this is nothing against Texas Children&amp;#39;s they clearly have done nothing wrong and this was the prognosis that we got was in no way their fault we just with Gunner&amp;#39;s Journey we want to be raw we want to be real we want to because we are finding ourselves in a position that Gunner is one of the youngest known diagnosed in America with this disease and where he is the researcher and he will go due to the links of what he&amp;#39;s got to do to look I&amp;#39;m afraid to go down those rabbit holes I don&amp;#39;t want to see it I don&amp;#39;t want to know I don&amp;#39;t want to I don&amp;#39;t want to face it until it hits me in the face and that&amp;#39;s all I can do is face it um and that&amp;#39;s actually one of the things that makes this the most difficult for us because I don&amp;#39;t know what to share with her and she doesn&amp;#39;t know how to ask me about certain things um you know it&amp;#39;s never good to hide things in our relationship and we&amp;#39;re not intentionally hiding something from one another once we bottle our emotions so we don&amp;#39;t hurt the other of the others having a good day you don&amp;#39;t want to you don&amp;#39;t want to take away from their good day or you know what yeah yeah what may not be on their mind you know um but let&amp;#39;s back to the story we&amp;#39;ve Gonna we took Gunner to to the neurologist at Texas Children&amp;#39;s and he came in and he watched kind of like the same test that the other neurologist did and um he just looked at us and he said I just don&amp;#39;t believe it&amp;#39;s muscular dystrophy he said I believe it&amp;#39;s a form of ataxia well I&amp;#39;ve never heard the word before I didn&amp;#39;t know what it was they didn&amp;#39;t make it sound like it was a major deal at the time and Jill&amp;#39;s kind of like okay cool I mean you just you leave thinking okay you know this is gonna be okay it&amp;#39;s gonna be perfectly fine you know he&amp;#39;s just a little wobbly and it&amp;#39;s going to be his life and he gets it from his mom so um he requested that we do another DNA test that focuses more on the brain and a certain area of the brain where the friedrichs Ataxia attacks back it from my understanding is the back base of the brain um yeah I don&amp;#39;t remember the exact portion of the brain and like I said we&amp;#39;re learning we&amp;#39;re we&amp;#39;re going through the motions as we can um there&amp;#39;s limited information on this because it&amp;#39;s a rare disease not just for children but across the board there&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s not a lot of cases known I think it&amp;#39;s estimated between 20 and 50 000 people or all that are known to have it total in the world well um so we we did the DNA test and it was maybe three weeks later they always set you up they always tell you it&amp;#39;s going to be a couple of months so you you&amp;#39;re breathing but you&amp;#39;re not breathing through it all and uh the phone rang and again we were home I don&amp;#39;t know why we were home I don&amp;#39;t know if it was the evening time or it was all such a blur I think is but he called and he he told us that Gunner had free drinks ataxia and um both of us were kind of like okay yeah what the hell what is this you know like what okay you know and he wanted us to come in well you know if they want you to come in it&amp;#39;s probably not more on the Lighter Side especially when they want you to come in right away um he got us in that that Monday it was a Thursday or Friday we came in that next business day and um they&amp;#39;re amazing they every question we had they didn&amp;#39;t it wasn&amp;#39;t necessarily they had answers to but they were willing to find out um when we I keep skipping all over the place because like I said we&amp;#39;re doing this wrong we&amp;#39;re not we&amp;#39;re not sugar coding yeah we&amp;#39;re not we literally walked in from the other room and said let&amp;#39;s do it now or else we&amp;#39;re not going to be able to do this um we&amp;#39;re trying to make this kind of a ongoing series to help anybody again whether it be our friends someone in our family heck looking back on it it might even help you or I or we haven&amp;#39;t heard you know you know Gunner whoever anyone that we can help with these videos is the purposeful well and back to the neurology the first initial neurologist appointment when he had mentioned it was a form of ataxia he told us that there is a specialist of an Ataxia specialist there&amp;#39;s two of them in the southeast United States and both of them worked at Texas Children&amp;#39;s Hospital in Houston one was there today and he was there or he was there that day and he was able to meet with us and um until we talked to him about a video and this I don&amp;#39;t want to really use his name or you know throw him out until yeah until we get him okay and on board or not whatever but he the minute he walked in you could tell that Gunner was his top priority he studied Gunner he never took his eyes off a Gunner he was he was enamored Gunner is the best way to put it I mean you see one like she said when when he walked in it was like a kid with the new video game but it kind of ways what it reminded me of is whoa what do we have here he lit up and he was really fascinated by Gunner and his entire story he wanted to know more about him he wanted to be able to research with Gunner and see you could see it wasn&amp;#39;t just another case some doctors and look there&amp;#39;s nothing against anybody out there in any field I understand that at certain points in your career you just go cold because you&amp;#39;ve experienced it too many times repeatedly I get it with this doctor that wasn&amp;#39;t the case any of them but I mean him especially when he walked in he he lit up the room he could feel he was so happy to be there with us which was almost a bizarre feeling in today&amp;#39;s modern world having somebody to be so happy to be in a room with you when something so traumatic is going on well and and both of us you know having strong faith in the Lord I I think God knew at that time we needed him and we needed him to be there right then to jump on um when we went back after the diagnosis it was tough to hear I still don&amp;#39;t 100 understand exactly um I know it will affect his Mobility it will possibly eventually take away his Mobility it will eat in his organs it it affects every part of who he is that&amp;#39;s what this disease is it typically does not come on until the late 20s early 30s we&amp;#39;re awaiting to hear results back from a cardiologist depending on what the cardiologist says could indicate how much of a life he&amp;#39;s going to have we don&amp;#39;t know at this point we&amp;#39;ve been told from what I&amp;#39;ve read problems with the heart can lead to a much shorter life for people with ataxia but if they have a normal heart if they don&amp;#39;t have any of the major problems there&amp;#39;s been cases living to their 60s and 70s and I&amp;#39;m sure some even longer they&amp;#39;re the obvious first question that everybody has is what can we do right now there&amp;#39;s only one medicine out there that&amp;#39;s approved for Ataxia for Frederick&amp;#39;s Ataxia and it&amp;#39;s only been approved for about a year I believe if that but it&amp;#39;s only approved for 18 and up right now um Gunner has a long list of doctor&amp;#39;s appointments um we had an appointment scheduled for a cardiologist um in the day before the appointment they called and said that because we have already done the EKG and the echo that that is not where we need to be that we need to be at cardiomyopathy um that appointment is in October I believe um which kind of leaves you out in the wild just wondering what&amp;#39;s going on it would have been nice to have a little bit of a follow-up just to say hey here&amp;#39;s the path we&amp;#39;re on here&amp;#39;s what we need to be looking at everything over here looks good or hey everything over here looks really bad we need to pay attention to this well and and my chart can be a curse and it can be a blessing it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s the internet yeah it&amp;#39;s an image of the internet the second you get two words out of a doctor you got to go run and search them up and go oh this is what he meant no that&amp;#39;s not about what he meant but you know right as concerned parents that&amp;#39;s what you&amp;#39;re going to do um Gunner doesn&amp;#39;t know Gunner knows he has something wrong with him but he doesn&amp;#39;t know exactly what it is at this point the best way that anyone has described what&amp;#39;s going on with dinner is Gunner himself he told his classmates in kindergarten that he had a virus of the brain and that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s a really remarkable thing for a six-year-old to be able to tell some other kids and actually and honestly he told the doctor that and the doctor thought that was pretty incredible he said he never heard it quite put that way before but it was a very accurate very understandable description of what was going on the best thing you can do for us if you&amp;#39;re the praying kind just pray for him I believe that this is Gunner&amp;#39;s testimony and he either is the cure or he&amp;#39;s going to find the Cure it&amp;#39;s hard it&amp;#39;s hard watching your child and all the dreams that you had for them it&amp;#39;s hard watching them and not knowing what people will say about him it&amp;#39;s hard thinking about the things that he can encounter in life I&amp;#39;m sure it is with all parents I I mean it&amp;#39;s just it&amp;#39;s different with this child because we were basically told the way that Frederick&amp;#39;s Ataxia works is he&amp;#39;s going to slowly diminish before our eyes he&amp;#39;s going to slowly lose abilities and to be told that as a parent to have a child that&amp;#39;s going to slowly be taken away from you in front of your own eyes I can&amp;#39;t tell you the amount of pain that both of us in we stay strong as we can not just for him but for our daughter as well for us ourselves um but it&amp;#39;s not an easy thing to do there&amp;#39;s a lot of times where I think specifically when we&amp;#39;re not around each other that we let some of those Gardens down and let some of that paint out [Music] again it&amp;#39;s all about you don&amp;#39;t want the other one to feed onto your day that you&amp;#39;re having or your fear that you&amp;#39;re having or and it&amp;#39;s not so much that we keep the fear from each other it&amp;#39;s just it&amp;#39;s one of those things where if you watch him and he stumbles it&amp;#39;s no longer it&amp;#39;s no longer oh he&amp;#39;s clumsy it&amp;#39;s oh gosh is it worse is it getting worse is it taking over and is it and we&amp;#39;ve been told that we may not be able to see the changes because we&amp;#39;re with them every day it&amp;#39;s that slow moving but then again he&amp;#39;s also six years old and it&amp;#39;s a completely different case than what anyone else has dealt with to speak of and there are cases where it moves more progressively faster cases where it moves more progressively slow there&amp;#39;s cases where it&amp;#39;s less severe and more severe and you know you&amp;#39;re sitting here wondering is this the type of wound that&amp;#39;s going to have to be taken to the hospital and stitched up or is this the type of room we go to the closet right there and abandoned it and fix it and there&amp;#39;s no one telling you either way there&amp;#39;s no no hey we can do this test and possibly give you some more answers we haven&amp;#39;t gotten any of that and that&amp;#39;s not a knock on anybody I don&amp;#39;t know there is a test that you can run to determine that there&amp;#39;s not that much information out there on this and again that&amp;#39;s one of the reasons we&amp;#39;re wanting to do this is because if our journey can help someone else if it&amp;#39;s a year from now if it&amp;#39;s 10 years from now whatever if it&amp;#39;s a month from now it doesn&amp;#39;t matter if we can help somebody else in a similar situation or somebody else that&amp;#39;s suffering through some of the stuff that we&amp;#39;re going through and we can reach out we know and you know because as our parents as parents you know I think a couple weeks ago I came to Chris and I told him I said you know as bad as this sounds like I picture it as a like a diagnosis that can be treated and why aren&amp;#39;t we fighting why aren&amp;#39;t we doing things to make our son better I feel like I&amp;#39;m failing my child because I&amp;#39;m not fighting I&amp;#39;m not I don&amp;#39;t I don&amp;#39;t know what to do I don&amp;#39;t know what to make this better I don&amp;#39;t know what to do I can&amp;#39;t take it away I can&amp;#39;t take it from him and that&amp;#39;s the raw of it there is nothing there is nothing to do but sit and wait and pray and hope and I have never felt more weak and defenseless in my entire life than I have getting this prognosis for him and like you said just being told to sit back and wait and see what happens us that&amp;#39;s one of the most horrifying things that a parent can be told and I mean I understand it is what it is there&amp;#39;s nothing else that they can really tell us unfortunately no but it doesn&amp;#39;t make it easier it&amp;#39;s just we want to make it clear that we&amp;#39;re not placing blame on them no no that&amp;#39;s you know we&amp;#39;re not placing blame on anyone it&amp;#39;s just it&amp;#39;s our emotions it&amp;#39;s the feeling it&amp;#39;s the the roller coaster of it all you know and you could be having a bad day and Gunner will come out with one of his witty witty smart alec comments and no I I will be honest with you at some point in time I&amp;#39;m sure God will be involved with these videos being one of our son is a huge smartass he is highly intelligent and I love him to death but he is a huge smartass it really is I mean for his age he&amp;#39;s highly intelligent he knows how to get what he wants huh he convinced us to get him his own cell phone at six years old and how did he do that you may ask we traded in our cell phones to get the somewhat newer model and in the time frame of trading them in mailing them in whatever we did with them used his mother&amp;#39;s old cell phone for a week or two on Wi-Fi no big deal right until your son gets back over from his babysitters to your to his grandma&amp;#39;s house gets Wi-Fi and picks up the phone and texts you and calls you and says I just wanted to let you know how much I love you and miss you and not just once every day how do you argue with a six-year-old that calls you and tells you I love you and I miss you I&amp;#39;ll never stop loving you the the boys not only is he highly intelligent he&amp;#39;s highly caring and you know it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s kind of one of those funny things it&amp;#39;s I watch different shows and think about my life growing up and I know he&amp;#39;s going to get picked on as he gets older I know he will that doesn&amp;#39;t bother me that&amp;#39;s part of life that&amp;#39;s part of growing up I&amp;#39;m sorry for anybody out there that doesn&amp;#39;t believe that but the truth you know it is that doesn&amp;#39;t bother me his smart ass smell getting him into a situation where he&amp;#39;s gonna get beat up is what bothers me um but we just we figured you know documenting this to you for one keep our friends and family in the loop and we haven&amp;#39;t shared with anybody really some of our deepest feelings about this we&amp;#39;ve told some people what&amp;#39;s going on but the amount of emotional drain that this puts on us we haven&amp;#39;t talked about it&amp;#39;s something that stresses our stresses us to our limits every day every waking hour and not even that&amp;#39;s not even fair probably because we stress about it even trying to sleep yeah and I mean that both literally and figuratively because our son still sleeps with us and through the slaps and the punches and the kicks that we get which is also some part of what&amp;#39;s going on with them because he gets restless leg and stuff like that I don&amp;#39;t know about the flailing arm syndrome but yes I get slapped in the middle of the night sometimes and yes I wake up pissed off um but it&amp;#39;s just you know you don&amp;#39;t know what no one&amp;#39;s got the the book that says hey follow these steps and you know you can&amp;#39;t change the course but here&amp;#39;s at least the courses that you&amp;#39;re on the path that you&amp;#39;re on nobody can give us that other than your head towards the car rack and it&amp;#39;s you know come on give me give me some guideline am I going down the freeway am I going down the back road am I well the steering wheel one way yeah something do I at least know the airbag is going to deploy something but it&amp;#39;s really how do you go to friends and family and explain what we&amp;#39;re going through when you can&amp;#39;t explain it to each other there&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s no right word for it you know I I don&amp;#39;t know um you know I think this past month I&amp;#39;ve been in make the appointments mode do this do this we&amp;#39;ve got to get this scheduled we&amp;#39;ve got to get this doing you know got to get this going got to get all this turned in and it&amp;#39;s but when you sit down and you stop and you just think it&amp;#39;s scary as hell you know it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s I mean you watch your son walk out the door and you don&amp;#39;t know how long it&amp;#39;s going to be until you can&amp;#39;t do that anymore you know or just coming downstairs or walk running around in the yard you know you don&amp;#39;t know how long it&amp;#39;s going to be till you&amp;#39;ve got to go pick him up and put them in I remember watching him play with the dog no one how long you&amp;#39;ll be able to do that you know it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s the smallest things in the world thinking of for a six-year-old you know you want to see him riding a bike you want to see him running around the yard playing ball we don&amp;#39;t know that we&amp;#39;re able to put our son in sports because we don&amp;#39;t know what his shape of his heart is you know it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s just so many unanswered things you know and we just we want everybody to be a part of his journey and show you what a warrior he is what a fighter he is and I believe there&amp;#39;s more to this than what we&amp;#39;re being presented with I I believe that there&amp;#39;s a reason why we found this so young I believe that you know and I think this is where Chris and I also we have differences is not differences we we&amp;#39;re on two different emotional roller coasters it&amp;#39;s you know I&amp;#39;m trying to put all my faith in God because in all honesty I&amp;#39;m scared if I don&amp;#39;t the devil&amp;#39;s gonna win I can&amp;#39;t say that I&amp;#39;m doing the same I&amp;#39;ve been very angry with God at times um namely because why would he do this to a child and I understand there&amp;#39;s lots of bad things in this world that happen to lots of great kids but something long and drawn out to such an innocent child it&amp;#39;s just whether it be my son or someone else&amp;#39;s kid it shouldn&amp;#39;t happen and um you know I it&amp;#39;s I don&amp;#39;t know that Gunner is going to change this disease I know Kirsten believes that he&amp;#39;s going to be the Cure I don&amp;#39;t know that he will definitively be the Cure but I do believe that he will help impact this for the positive and on that I also think it&amp;#39;s really important that we mention that we&amp;#39;re looking into um criminal clinical trials and stuff like that for gunner on behalf of not just Gunner but future Generations future kids if there&amp;#39;s something logical that we can do to help treat this it&amp;#39;s not going to negatively impact him you know obviously it&amp;#39;s clinical trial you don&amp;#39;t know for sure nothing is definitive with that but if it&amp;#39;s hey you&amp;#39;ve got a five percent chance of improving him in a 95 chance of doing harm to him hell no we&amp;#39;re not doing that we&amp;#39;re not being stupid about it we&amp;#39;re you know but we are looking we are fighting we are you know we&amp;#39;re we&amp;#39;re doing everything we possibly can to and again they&amp;#39;ve been taken care of yeah if there&amp;#39;s a clinical trial he goes to and sure enough they find it improves him by 20 then every other kid out there in his situation may stand to benefit from them we&amp;#39;re first and foremost it&amp;#39;s to get Gunner better but at the same time if it helps another child or another family who is going through this so be it um and I don&amp;#39;t know how frequent we&amp;#39;ll do these I don&amp;#39;t know you know our plan is to eventually introduce everyone to that doesn&amp;#39;t know Gunner personally that how what his life looks like and what the wobbly gate is and um one of the cutest things about Gunner is when we&amp;#39;re in Texas Children&amp;#39;s you know being a six-year-old and the doctor that I talked about seemed like he got his new video game he asked Gunner what his favorite video game is and it&amp;#39;s still True to this day which is about what five six months ago doctor looked at me said so what&amp;#39;s your favorite video game without missing a beat yeah it turns to him looks someone says wobbly life um the way I have kind of perceived friedrich&amp;#39;s Ataxia is it kind of gives off like a drunk person approach um when you see him walking he&amp;#39;ll he&amp;#39;ll stumble to one side he doesn&amp;#39;t really fall um he does a lot of tripping he does a lot of walking into walls or yeah it makes you think that he&amp;#39;s not paying attention where he&amp;#39;s going a lot of times yeah like hey watch where you&amp;#39;re walking buddy hey you know pay attention especially being a kid with the cell phone and everything else it&amp;#39;s a lot of times and I&amp;#39;m guilty of it too I&amp;#39;ve yelled at him and hey pay attention watch what you&amp;#39;re doing and it&amp;#39;s me thinking hey if you&amp;#39;re paying attention and watching what you&amp;#39;re doing maybe you won&amp;#39;t stumble maybe you want this maybe it&amp;#39;ll help you in the future maybe but the truth is is we just don&amp;#39;t know well and part of the attack is is the brain is the brain is telling the muscle to move a certain way but the muscle is not reacting to that wave I guess is what you call it or um so you&amp;#39;ll notice like Gunner might drag his leg not really drag it just kind of like flops I don&amp;#39;t know how to explain it some of his actions he moved you don&amp;#39;t know if they&amp;#39;re intentional or not uncontrolled or if you watch him run you would think we&amp;#39;d never let our child run a day in his life you know after your head you&amp;#39;re screaming run Forrest run it&amp;#39;s but um and please don&amp;#39;t you know like we have to find laughter in this we have to to get us through the days we have to laugh about some of it and even Gunner will tell you it&amp;#39;s you know because I&amp;#39;m wobbly because you know and I think maybe he uses that a little too much as an excuse we love him unconditionally there&amp;#39;s I I told him the other day I said and this is the truth about how I feel about both of my children both of my kids were gifts from God every day that I have with him is a present they don&amp;#39;t ever have to give me anything for the rest of the time the day that I&amp;#39;m alive or on this planet because they are my gifts every day that I have with them I cherish there&amp;#39;s nothing in this world that means more to me than them and I love you and you know I am I I mean it we&amp;#39;re we&amp;#39;re all fighting this as a family and I mean our parents our sisters our brothers our best friends you know like we have we have a great support system um but I think it&amp;#39;s too with them you don&amp;#39;t want to ruin their Days by because everybody has their own thing you know and this is such a difficult thing to deal with we are trying to internalize it and not burden anyone else with it I think is the best way well and I think too like I was talking to a friend a couple weeks ago and she told me you know I know my son&amp;#39;s diagnosis is nothing like Gunners and my heart kind of broke a little bit because I don&amp;#39;t ever want someone to feel like their child is less than my child is I guess how you would word it and I just told her I said you know regardless both of what they have has been life-altering it it changes everything you know um from waiting to get into our house to we don&amp;#39;t know if we can live here in a couple years you know because it&amp;#39;s a two-story house and he might not be able to get up and down the stairs or um lead up to the house there&amp;#39;s three or four stairs that lead up to the house and that might be too much um you know we&amp;#39;d drive a pickup truck is that going to be too tall for them uh you know it&amp;#39;s just the doorways if he&amp;#39;s having to use a wheelchair the doorway is wide enough I mean there&amp;#39;s a billion different things that you have to did you don&amp;#39;t have to think about but as a caring parent you do think about you already start questioning you already start worrying about you know it&amp;#39;s your deepest fears are exaggerated because of the condition that you&amp;#39;re placed upon into Christie&amp;#39;s point whatever your kid is suffering from I&amp;#39;m sorry for whatever they&amp;#39;re suffering from even if it&amp;#39;s just a scratched elbow scraped up knee from a bike ride whatever I&amp;#39;m sorry my kid&amp;#39;s not any worse off than your kid but it&amp;#39;s this is our story of what we&amp;#39;re dealing with and well and see we want to we want to be open with Gunner&amp;#39;s diagnosis and we have been pretty private about it up until now um but I think it was more so because we didn&amp;#39;t no we don&amp;#39;t we still don&amp;#39;t know but at this point we&amp;#39;re just tired of not knowing and you know that&amp;#39;s the hard thing is when you go to tell people about what&amp;#39;s going on here&amp;#39;s what he has what does that mean we don&amp;#39;t know what are you gonna do for it but we don&amp;#39;t know the winds start really happening we don&amp;#39;t know what is the warning signs we don&amp;#39;t know I mean it&amp;#39;s you know It&amp;#39;s a cruel joke in a lot of ways so I think that&amp;#39;s one of the reasons we&amp;#39;ve been a lot more private with it is because you just you don&amp;#39;t have any answers you know and so I think I think maybe privately even though we haven&amp;#39;t really discussed it I think that&amp;#39;s one of the things about this video that we&amp;#39;re hoping in some ways is that by expressing our feelings and some of the things that we&amp;#39;ve learned and some of the things we&amp;#39;re witnessing on this that maybe some of our friends and family can get those answers that we otherwise can&amp;#39;t provide well and just watching it you know our plan is to video some of Gunner and you know eventually getting him into this and um he&amp;#39;s already been in trouble for youtubing by the way in November we are we are going to meet a man who has fa also and he is doing a race and he um I reached out to him just because more so of I needed to know what it is I need to know what it looks like I need to know you know from someone who has it not something that Google tells me is what it is or um and so he you know reaching out to him he&amp;#39;s been he&amp;#39;s been great in in just he invited us to come meet with him and and I think it&amp;#39;s time we start introducing not only ourselves but Gunner to the fa world and you know understanding that you know as a parent with no answers you don&amp;#39;t know really how to approach this with your child and my theory is you know if if you haven&amp;#39;t been that lifestyle maybe it won&amp;#39;t be such a big shock you know um maybe it&amp;#39;ll be a little bit easier to transition into or I think it&amp;#39;s one of those things as a parent you do everything you can to help prepare your child for the life they&amp;#39;re going to face but in the situation we&amp;#39;re in we don&amp;#39;t know what that is we don&amp;#39;t know how long that is we don&amp;#39;t know what type of life that is we don&amp;#39;t know almost anything and so it&amp;#39;s you know I joked earlier about getting mad at him for different things and getting upset with them he&amp;#39;s a six-year-old kid you&amp;#39;re going to get upset at times but then I immediately turn back around and go think of what you&amp;#39;re going to miss out on if you&amp;#39;re upset with them and so you get upset with yourself but then you you have to remind yourself that it&amp;#39;s okay to be upset without a kid yeah he&amp;#39;s still gonna have to face punishments and um but you know from from here on on if you guys have any questions please don&amp;#39;t hesitate you know there might be things where we look at you and say we don&amp;#39;t know and we honestly just don&amp;#39;t know yeah we&amp;#39;re gonna post this to YouTube um we may post it to Facebook as well I don&amp;#39;t know but honestly I would prefer if you don&amp;#39;t mind even if your friends or family if you have questions put them on YouTube and the reason I&amp;#39;m asking that is because if there&amp;#39;s something a good question out there everybody&amp;#39;s going to have questions okay there is no bad question but some of your questions and some of our answers could help other people could help other of our friends could help other of our family like she said could help gunner in the future could help a complete stranger going through this situation so why take away from any of those people well it&amp;#39;s too fast with us putting it out there and there might be someone that has an answer for governor or you know it&amp;#39;s just something we felt compelled to do and you know this is this is Gunner story but right now we&amp;#39;re telling it because he doesn&amp;#39;t know a lot about it the way we explain it to him is he&amp;#39;s wobbly you know and and that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s where we&amp;#39;re at right now and I think we both agreed that as the things come on we&amp;#39;ll approach it from there and when it&amp;#39;s time it&amp;#39;s time we&amp;#39;ll tell them but right now he&amp;#39;s a six-year-old little six-year-old little boy that loves his video games and I think right now the videos are more for you and I and for our family directly and then as Gunner gets older he can understand that we&amp;#39;ve been here the whole time worried about him the whole time we&amp;#39;re fighting for him and that&amp;#39;s something really important for anyone to know is that their parents really did love them and they really did fight the flu especially in the case of any child that has a illness you know to know that your parents really do love you and they&amp;#39;re never going to give up so if anybody sees us from time to time and we&amp;#39;re just down or we&amp;#39;re stressed out we&amp;#39;ll be in quiet or being distant it&amp;#39;s not that we mean to be it&amp;#39;s just overwhelming it&amp;#39;s our life it&amp;#39;s our life right now it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s very difficult and there&amp;#39;s we don&amp;#39;t want to burden any more people than we have to with what&amp;#39;s going on because it is a burden it is a very challenging deeply emotional burden and I don&amp;#39;t mean that in a negative way against gonna but personally it&amp;#39;s a lot for anyone to deal with and we don&amp;#39;t want to put that burden on anyone that we don&amp;#39;t have to again we don&amp;#39;t know how regular we&amp;#39;ll do these or you know I mean it&amp;#39;s kind of a great little therapy session to get those fears out but um I&amp;#39;m doing away with fuzzy Kelly [Laughter] you do away with cow you&amp;#39;ll have a real one in here pretty soon um but again you know love our boy hug on him he&amp;#39;s you know he is a gift from God and he&amp;#39;s he&amp;#39;s not fragile you&amp;#39;re not gonna break him you&amp;#39;re not gonna you know if he&amp;#39;s doing something tell you exactly the way he feels doing something wrong by ball means you you get a hold of him and tear them up and you know we don&amp;#39;t treat him differently we don&amp;#39;t expect anyone else to treat him differently um if he acts up he gets in trouble he gets in trouble so but again if you have any questions don&amp;#39;t don&amp;#39;t hesitate to reach out to us we&amp;#39;re I think we&amp;#39;re at the point where we&amp;#39;re ready to tell our story in Gunner&amp;#39;s story and and if these start gaining more and more traction they&amp;#39;ve you know I don&amp;#39;t expect these to get thousands upon thousands of lives for my family and my friends but if they if if there are other people around the world that are interested in this we can set up an email or something like that to where they can contact us as well um or if you know someone that&amp;#39;s in our shoes and and yeah contact and just talk about it by all means you know it&amp;#39;s just we&amp;#39;re wide open to suggestion exactly so exactly yeah all right well I guess you end up with see you yeah until next time attached healing",

always just kind of be like well I have fa and they were like what&amp;#39;s fa and I&amp;#39;m like uh I&amp;#39;m not getting into that it started to really show in six grade and I was about 12 years old I remember I would get kind of certain treatment like I always had to have a top Locker because if I had a Locker on the bottom I was not able to easily bend down and use my locker on the bottom so I had to have a top one it was allowed to be late to Glass I didn&amp;#39;t have to participate in P sometimes I and I always use the elevator and not the stairs so I had all of those issues going on on top of nailing with they and when you&amp;#39;re a teenager it&amp;#39;s just so hard to like be different than everyone else for example I remember when I was like 13 years old and there&amp;#39;s this guy and he had a cur on me and he asked me out but when he asked me out he asked me it&amp;#39;s like one of the dances that were coming up and because I had fa I couldn&amp;#39;t go to dances because I couldn&amp;#39;t stand up that long [Music] cuz most dances are mainly spanning and dancing so I didn&amp;#39;t go to those so when this kid asked me out I said no because he asked me to a dance and I could go to dance but at the time being a teenager I was I was too embarrassed like say hey can&amp;#39;t going to dance because of my disability and we knew something else which I a new today but when I was a teenager it was not that easy to just save that I didn&amp;#39;t want to be disabled I didn&amp;#39;t want to be different I I was just trying to be a normal normal teenager I didn&amp;#39;t want to have all of these issues I didn&amp;#39;t want to have a I tried to ignore it I obviously I couldn&amp;#39;t just ignore it but I tried and it was getting more and more noticeable my friends slowly started distancing themselves and I was originally when I was in elementary school and early middle school I was like one of the popular kids and well like by everyone and I had a lot of friends and then I started getting more and more disabled and I started losing those friend and that was not fun it definitely took a toll on me as a person um I thought less of myself I still didn&amp;#39;t really understand why I had fa I didn&amp;#39;t want to have fa I I was just confused and trying my best to fit in even though I very clearly did not fit in I was never bullied to my face directly but I was definitely made fun of behind my back and I knew that and it was difficult to get through especially as a teenager and I also remember my middle school was so big or I thought it was because I was having to walk everywhere walk from class to class and walked all the way across the school which when I had a b that was not easy I remember when school went in all I wanted to do was go home and rest I didn&amp;#39;t want to go out I didn&amp;#39;t want to do any of that any outside activities after school ended because during school it was so much walking and physical effort and it was just hard and I was so tired that was pretty much what I was like for me in in school and as fa progress it started not only getting more difficult for me physically so be in school but it got a lot harder for me socially to fit in and be accepted I wish I was more confident and I disabled self as a teenager that would have made it a lot easier but I was just trying to not be different teenag years not fun for anyone and being disabled on top of that it just sucks it just then and then then I got to high school and I face the new challenge of being in a witer once I got to high school but if you want to hear about that go to part three and I will talk all about high school and FAA and what it was like for me and what it was like starting to use a wheelchair as my disabil progressed and all of that make sure to follow me and watch part three bye",

    "transcript": "Hey guys it&amp;#39;s Natalie again um i just wanted \nto take a minute and shoot an introduction   video for you guys because i know a lot of \nyou have already donated to the GoFundMe   and are kind of familiar with me my story, but \nfor those that aren&amp;#39;t, I know it&amp;#39;s sometimes   easier to watch video than it is to read a \nlong biography on someone. So, here it goes!   So, my life started out in South Florida. \nI was born normally; I was  asymptomatic   until around third grade when i had \na phys ed teacher (phys ed)  teacher   that noticed my gait was off when i ran and \nhow clumsy i was. My grandmother was also   a school teacher and noticed things such as my \nfine motor control and my hand-eye coordination.   So, my parents started doing research \nand taking me to neurologists at Jackson   Memorial in south Florida, but after a few \nmonths, I actually got really tired of it   and started to complain that i was feeling \nlike a guinea pig. Fast forward to the summer   of my fifth grade, hurricane Andrew decided to \ntear my family&amp;#39;s and my life all the way apart.   Our homes were destroyed, my mom and dad&amp;#39;s mine \nand then my grandparents, my dad&amp;#39;s biological   parents was also destroyed; we were separated \nand we all ended up moving to north Florida Once I was in north Florida,   i went on vacation to work with my aunt \nat my uncle&amp;#39;s building um cabinetry   shop, and i began complaining of back \npain when i got back to the house.   my parents decided to take me to an \northopedic doctor to have it checked out   because at this time, they had already \nstarted looking into a researching about    friedreich&amp;#39;s ataxia, and \ndoing their research, they realized   that one of the things that happens to \nalmost everyone who has FA is scoliosis So, they took me to an orthopedic doctor at   Shands in Gainesville, and yes, \nI ended up having scoliosis. So, when they found out I had scoliosis, the curve began to curve out, \nlike progressively faster   than the doctors had expected. So, with the next \ncouple of months, I had my first spinal surgery.   They placed harrington rods all the way down \nmy spine. i was probably around 12 and a half,   and then right after the surgery,   i had gone with my next door neighbor, who \nwas an older lady, like middle-aged mom   and um I went with her and her two-year-old \nwho I used to babysit for, to the public fair, and the little girl took off running \nand went to run away from me and her mom,   and being me, just a dumb kid \nmyself but not wanting to let her   get lost or whatever, I went and i grabbed her and \npicked her up, and I ended up popping the entire   top of my harrington rods loose, \nlike above my bra strap. So,   they were protruding almost \nall the way through my skin.   So, back in the hospital I went for me second \nback surgery. Throughout my high school years,   I was extremely creative and dabbled in just \nabout every art medium that you can imagine. I was even in acting and drama clubs and went to statewide competitions Throughout my early college career, I received an associate&amp;#39;s degree in \nmedical assisting. I worked off and on as both an office administrator \nand a medical assistant. So, while i was working, I decided \nto go back to community college. During my time at Santa Fe (SFCC), \ni uh fell and i broke my radius. A few months passed; the radius did not heal.   The fracture did not heal. So, \nthey had to go in and place a plate in my radius. I eventually graduated Santa Fe and was accepted into UF the uh sociology program. So, I made it all the way to my second to last \nsemester, and i started having severe arm pain and developed a very odd knot, \nlike right at the top of the scar. So, I went to the doctor, and they said,  \n&amp;quot;oh you developed a bone infection.   so we have to put you on a pick line \nof antibiotics,&amp;quot; for like three months. So, i said, &amp;quot;okay&amp;quot; So, I got a pick line, and as \nsoon as they did it, I knew something was wrong!   and they were watching it and as they like \nput the pick line in your arm, they watch it   and they were like oh no you&amp;#39;re fine mom \nI was freaking out no something&amp;#39;s wrong so   the next day, i was supposed to have the plate \nremoved, and i went to the hospital, and my dad   was like, &amp;quot;she screamed all day long something \nhas got to be wrong,&amp;quot; so they looked they did an   ultrasound, and sure enough i had i developed a \nblood clot like i think it was like two or three So, I spent the next six months debilitated completely and in bed, and i have no \nidea how, but somehow I ended up graduating from   the UF um sociology program with ba-uh BS. After \ngraduating from UF for the bachelors in sociology ,  the director and assistant director of UF \nHealth Arts in Medicine offered me a position. Halfway through my time of employment,   the director of UF arts in medicine opened up a \nmaster&amp;#39;s degree program in Arts in Medicine. So, I slowly began taking classes while \nworking. Halfway through my master&amp;#39;s degree   program, I met someone, and my life \nchanged completely. um a month after my first son was born, we moved out of my tiny one \nbedroom apartment to his nice big and spacious   spacious family-owned property. Although \nthe house is extremely spacious,   besides a pre-existing wheelchair and bars around \nthe toilet we installed when we first moved in,   the house is not at all accommodated \nfor me or my wheelchair i reached out   to every resource imaginable. \nfor example, habitat for humanity and for one reason or another, they can not assist \n me be it a lack of funding they no longer   work on mobile homes etc. That&amp;#39;s when my postpartum \ntherapist recommended that i do a GoFundMe. I was kind of iffy about this at \nfirst, and Frank was here working   on the doors, and i brought it up to him, \nand he agreed that starting the gofundme   to help me assist in accommodating the \nhouse was a wonderful idea. So, here we are today,   and that concludes the story thus \nfar along. thank you very much for your generosity.",
