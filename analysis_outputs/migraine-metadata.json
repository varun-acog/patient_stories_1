    "title": "Are we treating migraines all wrong?",
    "description": "We've been conditioned to see migraines as the ultimate adversary, but what if we've been looking at it all wrong? Dr. Elena Gross shared a perspective on our latest episode that flips the script. She argues that migraines aren't just a nuisance to be silenced‚Äîthey're a vital warning signal from our bodies.\n\nThink about it: treating the pain without addressing the root cause is like turning off a fire alarm while the fire rages on. It's easy to numb the discomfort, but what are we really solving? Dr. Gross, who once suffered from migraines 20+ days a month, now experiences them less than once monthly. That's a transformation, not just a temporary fix.\n\nIs it time we stop muting the alarm and start addressing the fire? This approach could revolutionize how we think about and treat migraines.",

    "description": "Think that‚Äôs quick? Yep, it is quick, but it‚Äôs no surprise since the gauge is 16 stitches per 10 cm‚Äîof course, you‚Äôll see results fast. ü§© That said, the total knitting time is much longer because, let‚Äôs be real, nobody can sit and knit uninterrupted for 23 hours. Even if you‚Äôre lucky enough to get 2 hours a day to knit, it‚Äôs still going to take about 12 days. ü§ì \n.\nI really loved working on #lighfallsweater‚Äîit was my first time using boucle yarn, and the sweater‚Äôs construction made it super easy. You barely have to pick up stitches, which is awesome because, if you‚Äôve worked with boucle before, you know picking up stitches (or even counting rows!) is almost impossible. \n.\nI'm almost ready to publish the pattern for this sweater.  Note that other yarns could work too, but you might need more blocking since the pattern has some rib texture. Boucle just feels perfect for this design.  üòç\n.\nIf you would fo for boucle, I‚Äôd suggest picking a light colour for the contrast as that's what's used near the neck where most of the stitch picking happens. It saves you from the double headache of dark yarn and boucle at the same time. A lot of testers skipped the neckband, which they said was because they preferred a wider neckline (totally fair), but I secretly think it was because they didn‚Äôt feel like picking up stitches for the neckband. üòÇ Honestly, it still looks great without it!\n.\nIf you want to stay updated and grab an exclusive discount on release day, make sure you‚Äôre subscribed to our newsletter!

    "description": "Please see BOTOX¬Æ Cosmetic full Product Information, including Boxed Warning and Medication Guide, in the pinned video on the homepage.\n-\nAndrew is a Los Angeles barber who breaks stereotypes around getting BOTOX¬Æ Cosmetic as a man. He shares what the treatment is like, his results, and what his friends think! \n-\nBOTOX¬Æ Cosmetic (onabotulinumtoxinA) is a prescription medicine that is injected into muscles and used to temporarily improve the look of moderate to severe forehead lines, crow‚Äôs feet, frown lines, and vertical bands connecting the neck and jaw (platysma bands) in adults.\n\nIMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION\n\nBOTOX¬Æ Cosmetic may cause serious side effects that can be life threatening. Get medical help right away if you have any of these problems any time (hours to weeks) after injection of BOTOX¬Æ Cosmetic:\n\nProblems swallowing, speaking, or breathing, due to weakening of associated muscles, which can be severe and result in loss of life. You are at the highest risk if these problems are preexisting before injection. Swallowing problems may last for several months.\nSpread of toxin effects. The effect of botulinum toxin may affect areas away from the injection site and cause serious symptoms, including loss of strength and all-over muscle weakness, double vision, blurred vision and drooping eyelids, hoarseness or change or loss of voice, trouble saying words clearly, loss of bladder control, trouble breathing, and trouble swallowing.\n\n\nBOTOX¬Æ Cosmetic dosing units are not the same as, or comparable to, any other botulinum toxin product.\n\nThere has not been a confirmed serious case of spread of toxin effect when BOTOX¬Æ Cosmetic has been used at the recommended dose to treat frown lines, crow‚Äôs feet lines, forehead lines, and/or platysma bands.\n\nBOTOX¬Æ Cosmetic may cause loss of strength or general muscle weakness, vision problems, or dizziness within hours to weeks of receiving BOTOX¬Æ Cosmetic. If this happens, do not drive a car, operate machinery, or do other dangerous activities.\n\nSerious and/or immediate allergic reactions have been reported, including itching, rash, red itchy welts, wheezing, asthma symptoms, or dizziness or feeling faint. Get medical help right away if you are wheezing or have asthma symptoms, or if you become dizzy or faint.\n\nDo not receive BOTOX¬Æ Cosmetic if you are allergic to any of the ingredients in BOTOX¬Æ Cosmetic (see Medication Guide for ingredients); had an allergic reaction to any other botulinum toxin product such as Myobloc (rimabotulinumtoxinB), Dysport (abobotulinumtoxinA), Xeomin (incobotulinumtoxinA), Jeuveau (prabotulinumtoxinA-xvfs), Daxxify (daxibotulinumtoxinA-lanm), or Letybo (letibotulinumtoxinA-wlbg); or have a skin infection at the planned injection site. This list may not include all available botulinum toxin products.\n\nTell your doctor about all your muscle or nerve conditions, such as ALS or Lou Gehrig‚Äôs disease, myasthenia gravis, or Lambert-Eaton syndrome, as you may be at increased risk of serious side effects, including difficulty swallowing and difficulty breathing, from standard doses of BOTOX¬Æ Cosmetic.\n\nTell your doctor about all your medical conditions, including surgery or plans to have surgery on your face, trouble raising your eyebrows, drooping eyelids, any other abnormal facial change, are pregnant or plan to become pregnant (it is not known if BOTOX¬Æ Cosmetic can harm your unborn baby), or are breastfeeding or plan to (it is not known if BOTOX¬Æ Cosmetic passes into breast milk).\n\nTell your doctor about all the medicines you take, including prescription and over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements. Using BOTOX¬Æ Cosmetic with certain other medicines may cause serious side effects. Do not start any new medicines until you have told your doctor that you have received BOTOX¬Æ Cosmetic in the past.\n\nTell your doctor if you have received any other botulinum toxin product in the last 4 months; have received injections of botulinum toxin such as Myobloc, Dysport, Xeomin, Jeuveau, Daxxify, or Letybo in the past (tell your doctor exactly which product you received); have recently received an antibiotic by injection; take muscle relaxants; take an allergy or cold medicine; take a sleep medicine; or take aspirin-like products or blood thinners.\n\nOther side effects of BOTOX¬Æ Cosmetic include dry mouth; discomfort or pain at the injection site; tiredness; headache; neck pain; and eye problems, including double vision, blurred vision, decreased eyesight, drooping eyelids and eyebrows, swelling of eyelids, and dry eyes.\n\nFor more information, refer to the Medication Guide or talk with your doctor.\n\nTo report a side effect, please call Allergan Aesthetics at 1-800-678-1605.\n\n¬© 2025 AbbVie.

    "description": "Why do we get a Brain Freeze?\nA brain freeze, also called sphenopalatine ganglioneuralgia, is a brief but sharp headache triggered by eating or drinking something very cold too fast.\nWhen the cold touches the roof of our mouth, it rapidly shrinks blood vessels.\nIn response, the body widens them again, sending pain signals to the brain, which mistakenly perceives it as a headache.\nThis quick, intense pain usually fades in less than a minute.",

    "description": "What Are Crypto Sandwich Attacks?\n\nIf you‚Äôve been into crypto trading , you‚Äôve probably heard of sandwich attacks . These sneaky moves happen on decentralized exchanges (DEXs) like Uniswap , where bad actors exploit how transactions are processed on the blockchain .\n\nHere‚Äôs how it works: A trader spots your pending trade, often a big one, and uses a bot to \"sandwich\" it. First, they front-run by buying the same asset just before your trade goes through, driving up the price. Then, your trade executes at this inflated price, known as price slippage , costing you more. Finally, they back-run by selling the asset right after, pocketing the profit from the price spike caused by your trade.\n\nThese attacks take advantage of blockchain transparency and slow transaction times, creating headaches for traders. To avoid getting sandwiched, try using limit orders to set a max price for trades. You can also explore layer 2 solutions or private transactions to hide your activity.\n\nPlatforms are fighting back too. Innovations like MEV-resistant tools aim to reduce these exploits by making trades fairer for everyone. While crypto sandwich attacks sound scary, small changes in your trading habits can help protect your investments.\n\nTimestamps:\n00:00 What are sandwich attacks in crypto\n01:00 example of how crypto sandwich attacks work\n05:00 Keep slippage low to prevent sandwich attacks\n\nüîó Trade on Bitget: https://bonus.bitget.com/fullvalue\nüîó Weex No KYC Exchange: https://support.weex.com/en/register?vipCode=kzvy\nüîóTrade on the easiest dex: https://gmgn.ai/?ref=fvd\nüîó Twitter: https://twitter.com/fullvaluedan\n\nNothing in this video is financial advice.

    "description": "Kain Sanson was recently dumped by the love of his life Eugenia. Naturally, he isn‚Äôt taking the break up well. Pretending to be happy has become a day to day chore. Try as he might, he isn‚Äôt able to put her out of his mind. It wasn‚Äôt as if Eugenia was the best of girlfriends. She openly cheated on him. From day one, she had informed Kain that she had no intention of falling in love. Alas, the heart wants what the heart wants. Follow Kain as he tries to get over his heartbreak with the help of his friends and family. Will Kain get over Eugenia? Or will this heartbreak keep him from welcoming a new love into his life. \n\n#lovers #pentacle #books #romance #tarot \nChapter 3\nCarina pushed Kain into the bed, and she got him out of his officer uniform. The two became locked in the mating embrace. After an hour, Carina got bored of the exercise in futility. The headache was making it impossible for her to enjoy her boyfriend‚Äôs familiar touch. She took her chill pill for her headache and she closed her eyes to sleep. While she tried to rest, Kain left the bed and he showered off Carina‚Äôs cooties. \nHe always did that after each play session. At the end of his libations, he went to his side of bed, and he slept as close to the edge as possible. While Kain slept peacefully, Carina turned in the bed like a spinning wheel. She turned her head to watch Kain‚Äôs peaceful slumber. How she envied the fact that he could fall asleep so easily. She stretched her hand towards him. He was so far away in the bed that she actually had to roll closer in order to pet his silky, black hair. \nCarina closed her eyes and instead of sleeping, she thought of High School. The former cheerleader had fond memories of her time in Barbara Goleman. She was in the best shape of her life, and she had her hot boyfriend Kain to boot. Kain was quite active in the afterschool Clubs, and he was the Track Star. Whenever the school had a late night event, there was Kain either in the audience or as a participant. At times it felt, that Kain spent more time at school than at home. This was to avoid going home to an empty house. \nHis grandparents where not always around. Grandpa Raphael and Grandma Esther had other responsibilities, that also included helping Jack get rehabilitated. When they were home, the pair would busy themselves grooming Kain into their perfect grandson. \nFrom his grandpa, Kain learned how to shoot a gun, how to fix the sink, how to change the oil in the car and other manly lessons. While he lived, Grandpa Raphael encouraged Kain to maintain a healthy lifestyle, to always exercise and to kiss girls whenever the opportunity presented itself. From his grandmother, Kain learned how to cook and clean after himself, and how to balance a checkbook. Grandma Esther taught Kain to respect women. \nCarina was trying to find the exact moment when Kain started changing. Before Carina realized it, she had fallen asleep. Carina awoke around the afternoon. While she slept, Kain had gotten up bright and early. Kain made breakfast for himself and his grandma. As tradition among grandmothers, Esther began her day by nitpicking Kain‚Äôs relationship with Carina. \n‚ÄúI can‚Äôt believe you allowed that alley cat back into our house,‚Äù said Esther before sipping her coffee. \n‚ÄúI know that you don‚Äôt like that grumpy old cat, but I worry about him,‚Äù said Kain alluding to a tuxedo cat he would sometimes allow into his house, ‚ÄúZombie looks like he might drop dead soon, and I want to make as many fond memories with him, before it is too late.‚Äù\n‚ÄúI wasn‚Äôt talking about that stupid cat,‚Äù retorted Esther, ‚ÄúI was talking about Carina! She comes and goes like she owns the house, leaving her little presents in every corner of the room.‚Äù",

What if the key to unlocking relief isn't in the medicine cabinet but in our genes?\n\nIn our latest episode, Dr. Barrett dives into the intriguing science of detox genes, particularly the GST gene, and how its abnormalities might be the missing piece in the migraine puzzle. She shares her own experience of discovering her genetic predisposition and how it led her to overhaul her approach to managing migraines.\n\nThis isn't about popping another pill. It's about supporting your body's detox pathways through mindful choices ‚Äì from the food you eat to the supplements you take. It's about taking control and reducing toxins before they wreak havoc.\n\nThis approach is not mainstream, and that's precisely why it's so exciting. It's time to challenge the status quo and consider that the path to migraine relief could be more personal and precise than ever before.",

I only got to Obsession but I am hoping to get 100% done. It will be a long and windy road to the end but it should be very enjoyable.",

    "description": "If you are new to the game Darkest Dungeon II is a Roguelike RPG very simple at first glance but it is extremely easy to end your run at every turn your party of heroes could perish. \n\nA lot of variables that can come in play both in your favor or your demise but some upgrades are permanent to provide an edge for the next run. \n\nI did play the game at lunch and it looks like it had changed a bit with all the patches and rework. I only got to Obsession but I am hoping to get 100% done. It will be a long and windy road to the end but it should be very enjoyable.",

Reports indicate that President Ruto may be avoiding visits to the region due to the growing discontent. Is the political landscape shifting in Mt.

    "description": "Febrilex Syrup is a medication typically used to treat symptoms associated with fever, pain, and cold. It is commonly used to provide relief from the following:\n\n+256700991510\n\nFever\n\nHeadache\n\nBody aches\n\nCold and flu symptoms\n\n\nFebrilex syrup often contains active ingredients such as:\n\n1. Paracetamol (Acetaminophen) ‚Äì a pain reliever and fever reducer.\n\n\n2. Chlorpheniramine ‚Äì an antihistamine, which helps relieve symptoms like runny nose, sneezing, and itchy eyes.\n\n\n3. Phenylephrine ‚Äì a decongestant that helps relieve nasal congestion.\n\n\n4. Caffeine ‚Äì may sometimes be included to enhance the effectiveness of the medication.\n\n\n\nThe combination of these ingredients helps manage symptoms of common cold, flu, or mild fever while providing relief from discomfort.\n\nAs with any medication, it's important to follow the dosing instructions and avoid combining Febrilex with other medications containing paracetamol or decongestants unless advised by a healthcare professional. Always consult a doctor or pharmacist if you're unsure about the dosage or if you have any underlying health conditions.\n\nLet me know if you'd like more detailed information or if you need advice on how to use it!\n\nThe common cold and flu (influenza) are both respiratory illnesses, but they are caused by different viruses and have some key differences in terms of symptoms, severity, and treatment.\n\n1. Causes:\n\nCold: Caused by a variety of viruses, with the most common being rhinoviruses.\n\nFlu: Caused by influenza viruses (types A, B, and C).\n\n\n2. Symptoms:\n\nCold:\n\nGradual onset of symptoms.\n\nRunny or stuffy nose.\n\nSore throat.\n\nMild cough.\n\nMild body aches.\n\nSneezing.\n\nGenerally, no fever or mild fever.\n\n\nFlu:\n\nSudden onset of symptoms.\n\nHigh fever (often above 100¬∞F or 38¬∞C).\n\nSevere body aches.\n\nFatigue and weakness.\n\nDry cough.\n\nSore throat.\n\nHeadache.\n\nChills and sweats.\n\nCongestion may be present, but it's not as prominent as in a cold.\n\n\n\n3. Severity:\n\nCold: Typically mild and self-limiting, lasting around 7-10 days.\n\nFlu: Can be more severe and may lead to complications such as pneumonia, especially in vulnerable groups (e.g., elderly, young children, or people with weakened immune systems).\n\n\n4. Complications:\n\nCold: Rarely leads to serious complications.\n\nFlu: Can lead to complications like pneumonia, bronchitis, sinus infections, or worsening of pre-existing conditions like asthma.\n\n\n5. Treatment:\n\nCold: No specific antiviral treatment. Rest, hydration, and over-the-counter medications (e.g., decongestants, pain relievers) are commonly used.\n\nFlu: Antiviral medications (e.g., oseltamivir) can be prescribed, especially if taken early. Rest, hydration, and symptom management are also important.\n\n\n6. Prevention:\n\nCold: Good hygiene practices (e.g., handwashing) and avoiding contact with sick individuals.\n\nFlu: The flu vaccine is the best preventive measure, along with hygiene practices.\n\n\nKey Differences:\n\nFlu symptoms are more severe and often come on suddenly, while cold symptoms are milder and develop gradually.\n\nThe fever and body aches in the flu are more intense than in a cold.\n\nThe flu can lead to serious complications, while a cold usually does not.\n\n\nIf you're unsure about your symptoms or if they worsen, it‚Äôs always a good idea to consult a healthcare provider.\n\nSeveral viruses are responsible for causing the symptoms of cold, flu, and coughs. Here is a breakdown of the key viruses associated with each condition:\n\nViruses that Cause Colds:\n\n1. Rhinoviruses ‚Äì The most common cause of the common cold.\n\n\n2. Coronavirus ‚Äì Not to be confused with the one that causes COVID-19, but some coronaviruses can cause mild cold-like symptoms.\n\n\n3. Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) ‚Äì Can cause mild cold symptoms but can also lead to more severe respiratory issues, especially in infants and the elderly.\n\n\n4. Adenovirus ‚Äì Can cause cold-like symptoms, but may also lead to conjunctivitis (pink eye) or other respiratory infections.\n\n\n5. Enteroviruses ‚Äì These can cause a range of illnesses, including the common cold, especially in the summer months.\n\n\n6. Parainfluenza viruses ‚Äì Often associated with cold-like symptoms, particularly in children.\n\n\n\nViruses that Cause the Flu (Influenza):\n\n1. Influenza A virus ‚Äì This is the most common and most variable strain. It can cause seasonal flu epidemics and pandemics.\n\n\n2. Influenza B virus ‚Äì Generally causes less severe flu symptoms but still contributes to seasonal flu outbreaks.\n\n\n3. Influenza C virus ‚Äì Causes a mild illness and is less common, often not associated with epidemics.\n\n\n4. Influenza D virus ‚Äì Primarily affects cattle and is not known to infect humans, but may be a concern for livestock industries.\n\n\n\nViruses that Cause Coughs:\n\n1. Rhinoviruses ‚Äì Cause common cold symptoms, including coughing.\n\n\n2. Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) ‚Äì A major cause of respiratory illnesses and coughing, especially in infants and the elderly.\n\n\n3. Influenza viruses ‚Äì Coughing is a common symptom of the flu.",

    "description": "Febrilex Syrup is a medication typically used to treat symptoms associated with fever, pain, and cold. It is commonly used to provide relief from the following:\n\n+256700991510\n\nFever\n\nHeadache\n\nBody aches\n\nCold and flu symptoms\n\n\nFebrilex syrup often contains active ingredients such as:\n\n1. Paracetamol (Acetaminophen) ‚Äì a pain reliever and fever reducer.\n\n\n2. Chlorpheniramine ‚Äì an antihistamine, which helps relieve symptoms like runny nose, sneezing, and itchy eyes.\n\n\n3. Phenylephrine ‚Äì a decongestant that helps relieve nasal congestion.\n\n\n4. Caffeine ‚Äì may sometimes be included to enhance the effectiveness of the medication.\n\n\n\nThe combination of these ingredients helps manage symptoms of common cold, flu, or mild fever while providing relief from discomfort.\n\nAs with any medication, it's important to follow the dosing instructions and avoid combining Febrilex with other medications containing paracetamol or decongestants unless advised by a healthcare professional. Always consult a doctor or pharmacist if you're unsure about the dosage or if you have any underlying health conditions.\n\nLet me know if you'd like more detailed information or if you need advice on how to use it!\n\nThe common cold and flu (influenza) are both respiratory illnesses, but they are caused by different viruses and have some key differences in terms of symptoms, severity, and treatment.\n\n1. Causes:\n\nCold: Caused by a variety of viruses, with the most common being rhinoviruses.\n\nFlu: Caused by influenza viruses (types A, B, and C).\n\n\n2. Symptoms:\n\nCold:\n\nGradual onset of symptoms.\n\nRunny or stuffy nose.\n\nSore throat.\n\nMild cough.\n\nMild body aches.\n\nSneezing.\n\nGenerally, no fever or mild fever.\n\n\nFlu:\n\nSudden onset of symptoms.\n\nHigh fever (often above 100¬∞F or 38¬∞C).\n\nSevere body aches.\n\nFatigue and weakness.\n\nDry cough.\n\nSore throat.\n\nHeadache.\n\nChills and sweats.\n\nCongestion may be present, but it's not as prominent as in a cold.\n\n\n\n3. Severity:\n\nCold: Typically mild and self-limiting, lasting around 7-10 days.\n\nFlu: Can be more severe and may lead to complications such as pneumonia, especially in vulnerable groups (e.g., elderly, young children, or people with weakened immune systems).\n\n\n4. Complications:\n\nCold: Rarely leads to serious complications.\n\nFlu: Can lead to complications like pneumonia, bronchitis, sinus infections, or worsening of pre-existing conditions like asthma.\n\n\n5. Treatment:\n\nCold: No specific antiviral treatment. Rest, hydration, and over-the-counter medications (e.g., decongestants, pain relievers) are commonly used.\n\nFlu: Antiviral medications (e.g., oseltamivir) can be prescribed, especially if taken early. Rest, hydration, and symptom management are also important.\n\n\n6. Prevention:\n\nCold: Good hygiene practices (e.g., handwashing) and avoiding contact with sick individuals.\n\nFlu: The flu vaccine is the best preventive measure, along with hygiene practices.\n\n\nKey Differences:\n\nFlu symptoms are more severe and often come on suddenly, while cold symptoms are milder and develop gradually.\n\nThe fever and body aches in the flu are more intense than in a cold.\n\nThe flu can lead to serious complications, while a cold usually does not.\n\n\nIf you're unsure about your symptoms or if they worsen, it‚Äôs always a good idea to consult a healthcare provider.\n\nSeveral viruses are responsible for causing the symptoms of cold, flu, and coughs. Here is a breakdown of the key viruses associated with each condition:\n\nViruses that Cause Colds:\n\n1. Rhinoviruses ‚Äì The most common cause of the common cold.\n\n\n2. Coronavirus ‚Äì Not to be confused with the one that causes COVID-19, but some coronaviruses can cause mild cold-like symptoms.\n\n\n3. Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) ‚Äì Can cause mild cold symptoms but can also lead to more severe respiratory issues, especially in infants and the elderly.\n\n\n4. Adenovirus ‚Äì Can cause cold-like symptoms, but may also lead to conjunctivitis (pink eye) or other respiratory infections.\n\n\n5. Enteroviruses ‚Äì These can cause a range of illnesses, including the common cold, especially in the summer months.\n\n\n6. Parainfluenza viruses ‚Äì Often associated with cold-like symptoms, particularly in children.\n\n\n\nViruses that Cause the Flu (Influenza):\n\n1. Influenza A virus ‚Äì This is the most common and most variable strain. It can cause seasonal flu epidemics and pandemics.\n\n\n2. Influenza B virus ‚Äì Generally causes less severe flu symptoms but still contributes to seasonal flu outbreaks.\n\n\n3. Influenza C virus ‚Äì Causes a mild illness and is less common, often not associated with epidemics.\n\n\n4. Influenza D virus ‚Äì Primarily affects cattle and is not known to infect humans, but may be a concern for livestock industries.\n\n\n\nViruses that Cause Coughs:\n\n1. Rhinoviruses ‚Äì Cause common cold symptoms, including coughing.\n\n\n2. Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) ‚Äì A major cause of respiratory illnesses and coughing, especially in infants and the elderly.\n\n\n3. Influenza viruses ‚Äì Coughing is a common symptom of the flu.",

(mention request)\n\nOur Father, Hail Mary, Glory be.\n\nPray for us, Saint Gemma, that we may be made worthy of the promises of Christ.\n\nLet us pray. O God, Who fashioned thy servant Saint Gemma into a likeness of Thy Crucified Son, grant us through her intercession the favor that we humbly request, and through the Passion, Death and Resurrection of Thy Son, may we be united with You for all eternity. We ask this through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.\n\nSt. Gemma Galgani, pray for us.\n\nDAY 5 PRAYER:\nOh glorious St Gemma, for years you greatly desired to enter the consecrated religious life, but God desired otherwise, telling you after many years that it was not to be, and thereby causing you such great disappointment. Yet, you accepted this great sacrifice and resigned yourself to the will of God. Teach us then, dear St Gemma, to accept the sacrifices and sufferings that God permits in our lives, especially those that are very much against our own will and desires. (mention request)\n\nDAY 6 PRAYER:\nBeloved Gem of Christ St Gemma, whose heart was all on fire for the love of God, teach us to love God with all our hearts, minds and souls, and fervently place God above all things, so ‚Äúthat where our treasure is, there also will our heart be.‚Äù (mention request)\n\nüíóüåπüíóüåπüíóüåπüíó\nPls. support my YT Channel (for my medical check ups and medications)\nPaypal Account: pink14mia82@gmail.com Thank you and God bless!\n\nMY YT CHANNELS:\nYoutube 1st Account: https://www.youtube.com/user/BehGerElle14/featured‚Ä¶\nYoutube 2nd Account: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2yVlapBF6Crg9H70_t7RyA\nFB Page: https://www.fb.me/CHRISTellePrayers",

    "title": "The Power of Teeth, Neck, and Cranial Health: Steven Mackay's Healing Journey",
    "description": "In this enlightening episode of \"The Every Dentist Podcast,\" Dr. Bahar Esmaili sits down with Steven Mackay, a patient whose journey from struggling with chronic health issues to discovering the interconnectedness of teeth, the cervical spine, and cranial health offers profound insights. Steven shares his story, from his childhood experiences with orthodontics and the subsequent health changes he faced, to his extensive research and experiences with chiropractic care, cranial adjustments, and innovative treatments. This conversation explores how seemingly disconnected health issues‚Äîlike neck pain, migraines, and even behavior changes‚Äîcan be rooted in the alignment of the body‚Äôs bones, and how Steven‚Äôs holistic approach to healing has led him to better health. Tune in to hear how an exploration into dental and spinal health can reshape one‚Äôs path toward overall well-being.

    "description": "I attempted to create a stunning aluminium foil dress, but unfortunately, it didn't quite turn out as envisioned. As a first-time foil dress maker, I faced challenges handling the delicate material, especially since I was wearing it! Despite the struggles, I persevered and learned valuable lessons.\n\nThe simple design belies the 24-hour headache I endured, as the foil kept tearing. Although it's not the couture look I aimed for, it's still 60% there!\n\nI'm sharing this look anyway, as it could inspire simple foil dress designs for fashion projects. I'm not giving up on foil dresses; I have more innovative ideas to explore!\n\nHere's the final look ‚Äì imperfect, yet a starting point for future creations!\n\nFeel free to modify it to fit your tone and style!\n\n.\n\nNehemica_\nInstagram-\nhttps://instagram.com/nehemica_?igshid=1myznysj2uqlo\nYoutube-https://youtube.com/channel/UCRy2d5epP7Q-XxLQY8C6JQg\nFacebook-https://www.facebook.com/nehemica1\n \n.\n\n\n\n .\n\nMusic: Early Hours\nMusician: @iksonmusic",

    "description": "The primary goal of the Lion Diet is to identify foods that trigger autoimmune flares. However, it also helps people identity food allergies, which cause severe immune responses, as well as identify food sensitivities and intolerances that can trigger less obvious symptoms like bloating, headaches, fatigue or digestive issues.\n\nWe suggest that you follow the Lion Diet for at least 6 weeks. When all trigger foods are removed, this allows your gut to begin healing and reduce background inflammation. With a less inflamed gut, it becomes easier to identify a reaction when a trigger food is slowly reintroduced later.\n\n*Follow Me*\nAll Platforms: https://linktr.ee/liondiet\nFacebook Page: https://www.facebook.com/LionDiet\nFacebook Group: https://www.facebook.com/groups/theliondiet\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/theliondiet\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/theliondiet/",
