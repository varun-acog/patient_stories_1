    "transcript": "imagine going to the doctor and finding out you&amp;#39;re literally allergic to yourself your immune system is supposed to keep you healthy protect you make life easier but in some people it actually has a full-on allergic meltdown in response to their own hormones let&amp;#39;s talk about five ways that some people&amp;#39;s immune systems are doing way too much in response to their hormones the first one is catamenial anaphylaxis in response to estrogen or progesterone so catamenial is a word that we use to describe something that happens in response to the menstrual cycle at kind of a cyclic fashion and anaphylaxis is a severe and life-threatening allergic response to something and often times something that should be generally harmless like your own hormones in your own body so these people actually experience cyclic anaphylaxis that life-threatening allergic reaction where your throat swells and you have trouble breathing and you need an pin or epinephrine to treat it and keep yourself alive and they experience this with no obvious external trigger only at certain points in their menstrual cycle it&amp;#39;s extremely rare and it can be related to exogenous hormones as well exogenous means something that you&amp;#39;re getting from the environment so hormonal contraceptive pills or patches or creams or whatever that kind of delivery can cause this but in some people endogenous or the body&amp;#39;s hormones that it&amp;#39;s making itself exposure can actually lead to these recurrent life-threatening allergic reactions interestingly people can just start having these symptoms after years of being fine most of the time it doesn&amp;#39;t happen like that but it can and there seems to be some relationship to most people who develop it kind of later in life have some inciting event exposure to some kind of exogenous hormone and then even when that&amp;#39;s taken away they continue to have it cyclically in response to their own hormones there are case reports of it occurring for the first time in response to pregnancy and then from then on out having kind of the sick look response again and frustratingly for a lot of these people it takes a long time to get a diagnosis because they may not realize that what&amp;#39;s happening is a cyclic response and they spend a lot of time trying to find the external trigger in their life that is causing the reaction it can be diagnosed with skin testing so basically injecting progesterone or estrogen and seeing if you have a reaction just the same way you would do any kind of allergy test and interestingly or sadly there&amp;#39;s actually case reports of people who had such severe and unrelenting symptoms that they ended up having to have their ovaries taken out for example because their life was regularly in danger but it&amp;#39;s rare in general and it&amp;#39;s very rare for it to be that severe an interesting and fairly odd kind of related entity is lactation Associated anaphylaxis or hypersensitivity and this is kind of like the same symptoms of severe allergic reactions hives trouble breathing things like this but only during lactation and it&amp;#39;s probably got similar mechanisms but we don&amp;#39;t know why some people experience it and other people don&amp;#39;t the reason that this happens and how it happens is really not fully understood but we know that estrogen and progesterone both have a role in cell stabilization and both can likely enhance a cell&amp;#39;s ability to release histamine which is a big player in allergic reactions in fact estrogen levels have pretty strong associations to severity of allergic reactions and people who are prone to having significant allergic reactions but the entity kind of is very Broad and has a lot of things at play so there&amp;#39;s probably other environmental and hormonal factors that go into it I just find it really fascinating that somebody could have this for a long time and be just pulling their hair out trying to figure out what their trigger is only to eventually find out or not find out that it&amp;#39;s their own hormones going up and down during their cycle that is causing all of this chaos the next one is autoimmune progesterone dermatitis or APD this is a rare cyclic reaction to Progesterone that happens in the second half of the menstrual cycle so ovulation happens and then that&amp;#39;s the ludal phase in the ludal phase as you can see up here the levels of progesterone are quite a bit higher and these people experience cyclic rashes hives ticaria significant itching during that part of their menstrual cycle so it&amp;#39;s usually like for 3 or 4 days before their period comes and then for 3 or 4 days after and then it goes away only to come again when they get back to that point in their cycle these people have generally been on some sort of progesterone at some point in their life either a contraceptive pill or fertility medications and that is thought to be maybe like a inciting event and then they start having these reactions not dissimilar to what we were just talking about but there are as well in this entity case reports of people who have never experienced it and then they get pregnant and now they experience it always moving forward so it&amp;#39;s probably kind of a sensitization response to either exogenous like oral birth control pills and then your body&amp;#39;s sensitized and now it happens all the time or to pregnancy really high progesterone levels now your body&amp;#39;s sensitized and it happens all the time again very frustrating and another one that can sometimes be very difficult for people to diagnose because if you&amp;#39;re just breaking out in hives every few weeks you probably are first going to think this has to be something in my environment you don&amp;#39;t first go oh this is you know related to my own hormones so yeah you&amp;#39;re basically in an immune response where your body treats your own hormone like it&amp;#39;s an Invader and reacts accordingly and the treatment can be antihistamines or steroids or anything that you would use to treat other significant allergic responses but again can be very frustrating difficult to diagnose and also frustrating to treat for the people who experience it next up is menstrual migraines this is another fascinating entity where people have significant migraines that occur right at this drop so where you see progesterone and estrogen plummeting so right before your period comes at the end of that ludal phase those levels drop people get severe migraines they can be one-sided migraines they can be whole head migrain some peoples are associated with dizziness and light sensitivity just like you would experience any other migraine but they occur only at that time just before your period And in the first few days of your period estrogen can interact with pain perception and the trigeminal nerve and also the estrogen and progesterone dropping can make the blood vessels a bit more sensitive to fluctuations which can trigger migraines in some people there&amp;#39;s a few options for treatment interestingly you&amp;#39;ve probably heard me talk about in other videos how if you have migraines especially migraines with aura that you probably shouldn&amp;#39;t be on an estrogen containing birth control pill that&amp;#39;s a distinct entity from menstrual migraines which tend to be more associated with that drop in estrogen so actually oral contraceptive pills with estrogen can be a very effective treatment for menstrual specific migraines there are also other migraine treatments that can be effective as well if you&amp;#39;re now questioning if you might also be allergic to yourself and had no idea me too sorry I I don&amp;#39;t mean to make you hypercondriac these are all fairly unusual and rare but subscribe if you are finding them interesting or learning something cuz I know we&amp;#39;d love to have you around next one is cyclic Volvo vaginitis so cyclic same as like what we&amp;#39;ve been talking about related to the menstrual cycle and Volvo vaginitis is inflammation and or infections of the Volva and vagina these people get recurrent and intense vaginal burning itching abnormal discharge just general discomfort swelling redness of the vulva and vagina in a cyclic fashion generally again just before they have their period or just in the first few days of their period their symptoms generally are worsened by intercourse and we do actually know a little bit more about what probably causes this one than the other ones in the video that we&amp;#39;ve been talking about these hormonal shifts that we&amp;#39;ve been discussing this whole video actually alter the ph and microbiome of the vagina just slightly and also temporarily but some people seem to be way more sensitive to those fluctuations in the microbiome and to the vagina and that leads to them having these symptoms those changes also make yeast infections more common and so some percentage of people who get cyclic vulvo vaginitis it won&amp;#39;t be an infective Source but in some of them it is actually yeast infections that are occurring only specifically at the end of that cycle and during menstration it can be really difficult to diagnose and the treatment is kind of the same as most things that are related to that drop in hormones and that&amp;#39;s continuous contraceptive pills or if it&amp;#39;s related to the microbiome specifically sometimes taking probiotics or doing things that support healthy vaginal Flora can be helpful it varies based on what the actual entity is but this is another one very hard to diagnose and often times goes underreported and underdiagnosed the next one is really fascinating to me and this is menstrual asthma interestingly this is quite common and this is where people who have asthma experience significantly more exacerbations just prior to their period starting you basically get a hormone induced inflammation that makes the lungs and Airways more reactive and that leads to a higher number of asthma exacerbations in these specific times where your hormones are fluctuating there&amp;#39;s a real complex interplay of hormones and how they affect the respiratory system&amp;#39;s function estrogen and progesterone both affect Airway inflammation and The receptors in the Airways affect reactivity to outside stimuli and anything that someone has as an asthma trigger just may be more triggering at certain times in their hormonal cycle this one comes kind of on a spectrum so more commonly it&amp;#39;s going to be that exacerbation when those levels drop off but there&amp;#39;s kind of a happy medium for healthy respiratory function and hormone levels and that significant drop off can mean more exacerbations but also really high levels of either can be more exacerbations and this is likely why people get more asthma exacerbations during pregnancy as well one reason that they do basically those hormone changes just kind of create an environment where exacerbations can occur more easily this is actually really common about 40% of people who have asthma will experience way more exacerbations at certain points in their cycle and I didn&amp;#39;t actually know it was that common until I was doing the research for this video I have severe asthma and I&amp;#39;ve never really taken note as to if it&amp;#39;s worse at certain points in my menstrual cycle the treatment is really just identifying that it&amp;#39;s happening and altering whatever is being used to treat the asthma changing dosing or frequency at times where they&amp;#39;re more likely to experience exacerbation but again that is the tricky part of this is that it is often underdiagnosed because people aren&amp;#39;t quite realizing and putting together that the symptoms are worse which means as Healthcare Providers we need to be asking people about it so to recap you can be allergic to peanuts pollen and apparently even yourself if your body has ever betrayed you in some really frustrating way I&amp;#39;d love to hear about it in the comments down below if you&amp;#39;d like to subscribe we&amp;#39;d love to have you I&amp;#39;ll see you next Monday",

Your choice? What&amp;#39;s our topic today? Migraine What foods will trigger a migraine? What are the causes? How does food therapy\nrelieve the symptoms? You will be interested in\nself-help with bare hands All this in this episode of... &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Every Body Knows&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; Seriously speaking, On the average, how many\nmigraine attacks do you get every year? It depends I get a headache whenever I see you The frequency corresponds with\nthe number of times I see you What about migraine? Migraine? I have not been able\nto resolve this problem Not to worry, we&amp;#39;ve invited experts\nto resolve it for you. Okay? Okay Let&amp;#39;s welcome Dr Bernard Lee,\na pain specialist Also, Juin Teh and Das DD Welcome! If Dr Lee can resolve\nmy migraine problem, he&amp;#39;ll indeed be my saviour I have a question. Have both of you\nexperienced migraine before? I do get headaches, but I&amp;#39;m not sure\nif it&amp;#39;s migraine or a normal headache Same here What about Juin? Yes. If it&amp;#39;s the first day of my period or... in situations where the weather\nor the lights are hot I&amp;#39;ll have migraine attacks Doctor,\namong your patients with headaches, what&amp;#39;s the percentage of migraine cases? Of all the patients I have treated, migraine make up 10% of the total That&amp;#39;s very high! The global incidence rate for\nmigraine is 0.014%, that is, 1,400 out of 100,000 people have migraine The incidence rate Incidence rate      -That&amp;#39;s right If we look at only those in their 20s, in the last 20 years, the number of cases increased by 37% They have migraine at such a young age?    -Yes Are people with migraine\nusually men or women? Most of them are women What&amp;#39;s the percentage? It&amp;#39;s 60% for women and 40% for men Most of the time,\nit follows the first period Women will link it to headaches Sometimes, they have a headache\neven before their period They have a headache\nfor their first period Subsequently, they have a headache\nevery month because of their period The headache and period come together That&amp;#39;s why sometimes\nthey have a problem with migraine Could it be caused by stress? Although it&amp;#39;s linked to stress, most of the time, it has to do with hormones,\nespecially in the case of women Therefore, when women are in menopause, it&amp;#39;s possible that the chances of\nhaving migraines are increased On the other hand, and strangely so, when women are pregnant, their oestrogen levels will increase During pregnancy, however,\nthey do not have headaches Well and good For nine months,\nthey hardly ever have headaches Besides hormones,\nwhat are other possible causes of migraine? In the past, it was said to be\na problem with blood vessels, that is, fluctuations in the blood flow to the brain\nor throbbing of blood vessels That will affect the chances of\ndeveloping migraine What we know now is that\nit does not trigger migraine, but it aggravates migraine Now we understand that... migraine is due to hormones, serotonin and oestrogen When their levels fluctuate, it will trigger nerve sensitivity Nerve sensitivity causes severe pain in the head Are there other causes of migraine? Let&amp;#39;s start with the eyes Sometimes, when the lights are glaring, the sun is blazing, the music is too loud, the environment is too noisy, there is a strong smell or... the consumption of certain foods, all this may trigger an attack Sleep Sleep? Sleep is rather important Do you mean sleep too much or too little? Sleeping too much can cause a headache\nbecause it applies to me Generally speaking,\nsleep quality is rather important You may wake up and... still feel that you are not very refreshed You still feel very tired and sluggish These are factors that will trigger\nmigraine attacks Exercise is good            -That&amp;#39;s right However, strenuous exercise\nwill trigger a migraine attack Does eating too full\nalso lead to migraine? It&amp;#39;s probably rare Most of the time, it&amp;#39;s hunger If you are too hungry,\nyou will have migraine Simply put, is migraine a severe pain... on one side of the head? Wrong                    -No? Most of the time,\nmigraine pain occurs on one side In 80% of the cases,\nthe pain is on one side Many patients also experience pain\non both sides There are four phases of migraine\nbeginning with... the prodrome phase In this stage,\nthe headache has not started People in this phase experience discomfort and... poor mental health They are bad-tempered The neck is tight and painful These symptoms occur\nwithin a day, that is, 6 to 24 hours before the attack After that, it is the aura phase The symptoms are flashes accompanied by... numbness and tingling in the face One will feel dizzy, as though... Icy cold The person stutters and\ncan&amp;#39;t express the words Then we come to the third phase... where the headache is most severe The pain is so intense that one vomits Yes The person vomits and is dizzy, hides in a corner and\nrefuses to talk to anyone because... when you are in great pain,\nyou can&amp;#39;t go near anyone So, the next time people tell us\nthey have migraine, we understand their pain now I had always thought that it was\njust a headache or a bad one On a scale of 0 to 10, zero is no pain and\n10 is excruciating pain For them, it&amp;#39;s 11 Right. What about Phase 4? The peak of some headaches\ncan persist for... a week One is in pain every day When the pain subsides in the postdrome phase, it can be gradual or... it can go away after sleeping Welcome, Dr Zhong Wei Liang,\nto our discussion What is the TCM perspective on migraine? Headache is an age-old ailment Yes According to historical records, Cao Cao from the Three Kingdoms Period\nhad chronic headaches It was recorded that he had\nsymptoms of dizziness and nausea From today&amp;#39;s medical point of view, it was a classic case of migraine So-called migraine        -That&amp;#39;s right In TCM, is migraine\ndifferentiated by locations? Yes. In TCM, a Shaoyang headache\nis so-called because... it occurs at the Shaoyang meridians\non both sides of the head If the pain is in the neck,\nit&amp;#39;s a Taiyang headache If the headache is at the crown,\nit&amp;#39;s a Jueyin headache For some patients,\nthe pain is in the forehead It&amp;#39;s called the Yangming headache Is the cause linked to the organs? In TCM theory,\nthe cause is dysfunctional organs It leads to the body producing &amp;quot;rubbish&amp;quot; In TCM, they are phlegm dampness,\nblood stasis and internal heat Yes This leads to blocked clear orifice or... brain malnourishment... which causes headaches &amp;quot;Blocked clear orifice&amp;quot;?\nWhat does that mean? It&amp;#39;s also my first time hearing it It refers to our head In TCM theory,\nthe best essence is in the brain But when the organs are dysfunctional, there will be blood stasis, phlegm dampness, or liver wind due to yin-yang imbalance Or there will be internal heat\nbecause of internal fire The fire rises to the head and... disrupts the functions in the head We call it &amp;quot;blocked clear orifice&amp;quot; What exactly is the cause? We analyse it from\nfour patterns of pathogenesis The first cause is\nliver yang ascendant hyperactivity This means that you are\nunder stress, overworked, in long-term negative mood and tensed All this causes liver depression and qi stagnation The liver will thus produce heat This heat will ignite liver fire If the liver fire is intense, it will accelerate the ascendant of liver yang... which rises with qi and blood to the head The excessive supply of blood to the head... will trigger a migraine attack In TCM, this is called\n&amp;quot;liver yang ascendant hyperactivity&amp;quot; The second cause is\nphlegm-dampness blocking the orifices Eating pan-fried and deep-fried foods, smoking, and drinking alcohol will,\naccording to TCM, cause your digestive functions to deteriorate This is known as spleen dysfunction The body will produce a lot of &amp;quot;rubbish&amp;quot; In TCM, this &amp;quot;rubbish&amp;quot; is phlegm-dampness It&amp;#39;s actually the end products of metabolism This phlegm-dampness flows along... the meridians to your brain.. to trigger migraine In phlegm-dampness blocking the orifices, the pain feels like your head\nis being wrapped In TCM, it&amp;#39;s called heavy-headness It has a characteristic It always has a digestive symptom -\nnausea, vomiting or loss of appetite The third cause is internal\naccumulation of sludged blood It refers to one&amp;#39;s congenital deficiency\nand acquired strain The flow of our qi and blood\nbecomes problematic It&amp;#39;s blood stasis Because it causes obstruction, your blood vessels become dysfunctional So, there is pain due to blockage Any other... Another cause is\nthe six external evils invading the brain My observation of these patients is that... they liked everything to be cold\nin their younger days They switched on the air conditioner\nafter showering Our elders will say\n&amp;quot;Wind has entered your head&amp;quot; That&amp;#39;s what happens In TCM theory,\nit&amp;#39;s external evils entering the brain The brain is malnourished But it&amp;#39;s a trigger You may be predisposed to migraine You may get it whenever\nyou are in an airconditioned place Do different triggers mean that... your treatment methods for migraine\nare not the same? That&amp;#39;s right Generally, if you seek\nTCM treatment for migraine, we will encourage you\nto undergo acupuncture first When my migraine was serious, Guo Liang recommended\na TCM physician to me The physician said that I had to have\nacupuncture every day for seven days He did it on my head, face, both hands, knees and toes That&amp;#39;s more than 20 needles Never had I perspired so much before I felt detoxed I was like floating on clouds I felt good The traditional\npurgative method of acupuncture... promotes the flow of qi\nto detoxify the body It&amp;#39;s like the junk\ndeleted from our handphones... and the handphones reset The body recovers         -Reset Is auricular acupuncture\nanother type of acupuncture? Yes, it&amp;#39;s a type of acupuncture The ear is divided into parts and acupoints We use a type of seed\nin Chinese medicine called vaccaria seed It&amp;#39;s taped on an acupoint The patient massages it at home It relieves pain There is also an emergency method Supposing you have\na sudden migraine attack Bloodletting is done on the ear tip After the acupuncture needle is sterilised, the acupoint at the tip of the ear\nis pricked to let out blood I had gone through this before It can relieve acute migraine The physician did the bloodletting... on the second day of\nmy acupuncture treatment About a shot glass of blood\nwas drawn out from here Does the ear have so much blood? The blood is allowed to flow naturally If not, we&amp;#39;ll press it again The blood was dark and thick That&amp;#39;s black blood.\nWhat&amp;#39;s let out is bad blood Does massage help? In acute cases,\nthere are specific acupoints to massage Most cases are not severe migraine\nand can be relieved Guasha (scraping) is also helpful    -Yes But long-term treatment with\nChinese medicines will be more effective Chinese medicines? Take Chinese herbs Dr Zhong, what&amp;#39;s the name of\nthis herbal tea? Rose and Gambir Vine Tea What are the ingredients? The first ingredient is the well-known\ngouteng (Gambir vine stem, 9g) In TCM, it is known to dispel wind, alleviate spasms,\npacify liver yang and relieve pain This is chuanxiong (Sichuan lovage rhizome 9g),\nan ingredient in bak kut teh Chuanxiong invigorates blood,\nresolves stasis and relieves pain To open up blood vessels and\nprevent excessive expansion, this is the herb Baizhi (White angelica root, 9g)\nis an aromatic that... relaxes muscles and relieves pain Rose buds (9g) soothe the liver,\ndisperse stagnation, invigorate blood and relieve pain Peppermint (6g) disperses wind-heat,\nclears eyes, head and throat, and relieves pain Finally, jujubes (4 or 5) Jujubes are used in this instance... mainly to harmonise\nthe harsh properties of other herbs and... increase sweetness, so don&amp;#39;t add rock sugar or such Preparation method? Infuse the herbs in a thermal flask of water Then drink the tea Discard the herbs once they lose flavour It&amp;#39;s drunk like a tea That&amp;#39;s convenient Is it suitable for everyone? This herbal tea is, of course, meant to relieve a migraine, especially for\nadults with migraine This decoction has\nanother characteristic If you have no headache but... feel stressed and lightheaded, you can also drink this tea It&amp;#39;s rather soothing I don&amp;#39;t really like bitter beverages,\nbut this is soothing I feel the same way And now, let&amp;#39;s find out... how migraine is treated\nin Western medicine Prevention is better than cure The patient needs to be aware of\nwhat the triggers are, for instance, sleep Right If your bedtime is 11 o&amp;#39;clock every night, fix it at 11 pm Try to stick to 11 pm Also, be mindful of your diet Some people say that\nspicy foods, coffee or tea... will trigger a migraine attack Chocolates Chocolates and such Every individual is affected by\ndifferent triggers, so you need to know\nwhat your triggers are And of course,\ndo not exercise too strenuously Rest in a quiet place Avoid noisy places       -Yes Manage your stress Stress If we can manage it well, the incidence rate\nwill decrease significantly We must, of course,\nalso manage our medications because... some people are\nallergic to certain medicines With reference to targeted medications, there is a large group of\nmedications called triptans Triptans target pain nerves by... working like serotonin\nto regulate pain signals They control blood vessels by... reducing blood vessel swelling,\nand blood flow The sensitivity is also reduced Another special medication is CGRP\n(calcitonin gene-related peptide) inhibitors They are prescribed when the first group of\nmedications is not effective They are not effective Then we will have to use CGRP inhibitors Yes, CGRP In most cases, CGRP inhibitors are injected once a month Severe migraine is harder to treat We will consider other injections Inject it in the head       -For example? For example, Botox The principle is to relax tight muscles.... because during a migraine attack, besides the muscles in\nthe blood vessels and brain, most of the time,\nour external muscles are also tight The muscle cramp is bad Apart from Botox, there are also injections that use platelets Platelets? Serum It&amp;#39;s the same principle as Botox, but you are using your own blood now The platelets in the blood\nare used for repair work Botox relaxes the muscles This one repairs the muscles, albeit slowly The effect is slow The effect of Botox is more immediate The effect is felt within 24 hours Right I&amp;#39;m curious When I have a migraine attack, I&amp;#39;ll think of buying painkillers\nfrom a pharmacy or supermarket Are they effective? At the onset,\nmigraine is like the usual headache Therefore,\nthe first step is to take painkillers These are non-steroidal painkillers For example, ibuprofen and aspirin... can relieve headaches But for 50% to 70% of people with headache, these medicines are ineffective We have someone here who has migraine... to share her experience Hello, Jane      -Hello My first question is, when did you start having\nthis problem with migraine? It was some time in 2010 As a beautician, whenever I lowered my head to\ncarry out beauty treatments, I would feel a dull pain in my neck The pain gradually extended to my head The pain was on one side of\nmy face and head It gradually extended to my eyes and face It&amp;#39;s similar to my case.\nWhat was your worst experience? I remember once when I was\non my way to see the doctor The car ride made me sick I felt nauseous and dizzy When I reached home\nafter seeing the doctor, I had to draw my bedroom curtains I needed to switch on the air conditioner\nin my bedroom, and no noise I didn&amp;#39;t lie down, but was semi-reclined How long did it take for\nthis condition to go away? It would take a few days Any problems with eating? I couldn&amp;#39;t eat much because\nI would feel nauseous Exactly I couldn&amp;#39;t drink much either You&amp;#39;d vomit, right?      -Yes I started by giving her platelet injections... because painkillers did not help She&amp;#39;s a beautician.\nDidn&amp;#39;t you tell her about Botox injections? Botox was used subsequently It was?          -Yes Besides the two types of injections, did you receive other types of treatment? Dr Lee recommended physiotherapy,\nthat is, trigger point release It&amp;#39;s like exercise therapy Physiotherapy and exercise therapy\ncan help with... throbbing blood vessels, nerve sensitivity, muscle health and stamina It also improves sleep slightly Did you seek treatment\nfrom a TCM physician? I underwent acupuncture Acupuncture      -Right Did you you make any changes\nin your daily life? Sometimes, I do some basic exercises After I completed the treatment, Dr Lee taught me\nsome neck stretching exercises It relaxed my neck What about Dr Zhong? Is there a self-help method for\na sudden migraine attack? It&amp;#39;s using our bare hands to massage We select a few acupoints I will use your hand to demonstrate The Hegu acupoint is between\nthe first and second metacarpal bones It&amp;#39;s here, what we call the tiger&amp;#39;s mouth It&amp;#39;s not between these two muscles It&amp;#39;s the empty space near this metacarpal bone Press it. It&amp;#39;s a dull pain The classic quatrains of\n&amp;quot;Toumian Hegu Shou&amp;quot; ... means that the Hegu acupoint is used\nto treat diseases of the head and face The other one is the Taiyang acupoint Slide your finger along the eyebrow\nto this depression This is the Taiyang acupoint And the most important acupoint is\nthe Fengchi acupoint It&amp;#39;s located at the back of the neck\nbetween the two trapezius muscles Feel the depression Fengchi acupoint is at the depression Fengchi        -Yes, Fengchi acupoint When you have a migraine attack, we need to go to a room Find a quiet place\nso that you won&amp;#39;t be disturbed Then press the Hegu acupoint Press the hegu acupoints of both hands If you hit the right spot,\nyour hand will feel a dull pain It&amp;#39;s a dull pain    -It&amp;#39;s intense Press for how long?      -5 to 10 minutes Then switch acupoints Use three fingers... to massage the Taiyang acupoint After massaging the Taiyang acupoint, use your thumbs... to locate the depression\nbetween the two tendons Press gently.\nYou will also feel a dull pain This is the Fengchi acupoint You can repeat it So, do it continuously,\nthree to five sets every time Yes, three to five sets\nto alleviate the pain If the migraine is mild,\nit should be alleviated quickly All right, got it          -Yes Seek treatment if you have a health issue Don&amp;#39;t keep it to yourself\nand shed lonely tears Thank you very much,\nDr Lee and Dr Zhong, for sharing and explaining Thank you And not forgetting\nJuin and Das DD.

    "transcript": "ABC listen podcasts radio news music and more Char Clair trying to come back remember the medium tire is is off go to McLaren first of orando Norris then Oscar piastri and Maxa and he&amp;#39;s on line to take second place and he does so as the Australian driver spins at the penultimate corner of the racetrack can he keep the car going is that the moment that home Victory dreams are dashed for Oscar pastry it actually was the 23-year-old continued a cursed run for hopes at the Australian Grand Prix and it might not have been the biggest blow for Oscar piastri perhaps just as concerning was the fact that he was ordered not to attack teammate and race win or Lando Norris when the race was in the balance we&amp;#39;re looking at what comes next for the Victorian pulling apart a brilliant drive from Lando Norris and unraveling Lewis Hamilton&amp;#39;s Ferrari deu man he looks good in red I&amp;#39;m Patrick stack this is ABC Sport Daily [Music] Jesse eight is the host of Fox Sports F1 coverage he spent the weekend cruising around the pits at Albert Park talking to the biggest names in the sport we got to start with Oscar pastri Jess a Podium look there for the taking how did it go so wrong it certainly did didn&amp;#39;t it pat he was on what a moment uh for that young man to be starting his home Grand Prix from the front row of the grid it was really obvious from the get though that McLarens were going to be the team to beat but I don&amp;#39;t know that anyone had forecast just how wet it was at Albert Park we knew there was going to be rain it came down in bucket loads from uh the very beginning of the day right up until Formula 1 hit the track we&amp;#39;re really lucky to get some dry running but do not underestimate how tricky it was out there for all of those F1 drivers I think Isaac haer uh painted it best when he didn&amp;#39;t even get through the formation lap oh we got somebody off already we have already one of the racing balls that is Isaac haer who looks like he&amp;#39;s trying to get the car into gear at the very least got broken rear wing I think he has look look at the angle of that rear wing it&amp;#39;s at 45° for Oscar piastri certainly he feels like it&amp;#39;s an opportunity missed uh because his teammate Lando noris went on to claim victory at the Australian Grand Prix what&amp;#39;s so impressive or one of the many things that&amp;#39;s impressive about Oscar is his maturity and just how even he is emotionally for 23 years of age you could hear afterwards that he was just lied with himself it was palpable wasn&amp;#39;t it Jess it certainly was he&amp;#39;s a bit of an old soul isn&amp;#39;t he Oscar piastri he&amp;#39;s very measured he&amp;#39;s very sensible he&amp;#39;s a real racer at heart and I think he is well aware of the fact that McLaren are going to be the team to beat this year they&amp;#39;ve got car Pace they&amp;#39;ve got team performance and it&amp;#39;s really going to be a contest between he and his teammate Lando Norris they&amp;#39;re matched in terms of pace Lando has that little bit more experience than Oscar and that&amp;#39;s probably what was the difference uh for him at the Australian Grand Prix uh yeah obviously I&amp;#39;ve only got my myself to blame tried to push too much in those conditions and probably it&amp;#39;s one of those moments in his career where that emotion maybe took over for him he knew that there was an opportunity to not just be on the podium but potentially win his home Grand Prix uh and it just caught him out and unfortunately didn&amp;#39;t finish where he probably should have what Australian fans and piastri must be somewhat concerned about is the return of the so-called papay rules I mean you&amp;#39;re great in this scenario because you can paint the nuance and the context into something that from a casual sports fan seems so obvious what are the papy rules why have they returned and should Oscar feel as though he&amp;#39;s kind of got a bit of a raw deal here look it&amp;#39;s much more complicated than what it probably appears to be so the papaya rules are the teammates cannot take each other out they cannot touch they can race hard but it has to be fair and the number one rule is that they both finish and get points and as many points as they can I think the way that it&amp;#39;s going to pan out this year in terms of the driver&amp;#39;s Championship is Lando is fast and so is Oscar and they&amp;#39;re going to be taking points off each other in the pursuit of becoming the driver&amp;#39;s Championship the other championship of play of course is the constructor&amp;#39;s championship which McLaren actually took out last year they beat Ferrari by 14 points it&amp;#39;s such a thrilling finish uh to that context so it&amp;#39;s really important that they try and win both this year and the management of those two drivers is going to be really fascinating I think everyone&amp;#39;s trying to play play fair at this point and then what it looks like by the end of the season when it&amp;#39;s all on the line is going to be really interesting but when the call came yesterday we should hold position please hold position and transition to the dry clear the back markers there was a lot more going on you can&amp;#39;t forget they&amp;#39;ve got hundreds of people with their eyeballs on this working trying to manage the strategy and forecast what&amp;#39;s going to happen and given the weather conditions that we had yesterday there was more rain coming they also had such good Pace that they were lapping people people so they were trying to make their way through back markers but also then forecast what was going to happen with the weather so they were told to hold position until they had cleared some of those back markers they had a clear understanding of when that rain was actually going to come and it was probably two or three laps later that it did until Oscar was then cleared to race with Lando now sometimes the timing of those things aren&amp;#39;t great because you could see Oscar had gotten almost to the back of Lando and there was a real opportunity to make his move the team first and foremost are trying to make sure that they have both cars finished the Grand Prix to claim maximum points in the driver&amp;#39;s championship and in the constructor&amp;#39;s championship and that&amp;#39;s where I guess the convoluted nature of uh the management of those two comes from when you&amp;#39;ve got conflicting aspirations at this level it&amp;#39;s always going to be such a tough manage and we&amp;#39;ve got pastri on record saying he thinks he can win a world title this year you know I&amp;#39;m definitely going into this year with the aim and and preparation for trying to challenge for a championship and trying to challenge for both championships might sound big but when you consider the likes of Max verstappen Lewis Hamilton Sebastian vle all did it at about 23 24 years of age it seems a lot more reasonable he&amp;#39;s locked into a four-year deal at McLaren he&amp;#39;s entering his prime does that mean from the context you&amp;#39;ve outlined there that for him to win races this year he&amp;#39;s going to need to kind of dominate in qualifying to show hey I&amp;#39;m quicker and I&amp;#39;m going to be a priority for this race well I think traditionally in Motorsport whoever qualifies first gets uh strategy and pit prity that&amp;#39;s just how the game seems to work and so for Oscar he is going to need to find that edge overlando now we saw there was next to nothing in it and qualifying to take the pole position and for 3 seconds there Oscar had the pole for his home Grand Prix until Lando just pipped him by 410 pastri fastes by a long way half a second for the rest to try and make up he can hear the ruls you can see the celebrations but is Lando Norris going to deny him Norris crosses the line and he takes pole for sure I think will go away and look at how he can now find an edge over his teammate because those two are going to be racing but when you shake it all out it&amp;#39;ll come down to who makes the least amount of mistakes through the season now Oscar&amp;#39;s already made a mistake uh in the opening Grand Prix Lando was absolutely perfect he didn&amp;#39;t put a foot wrong out in front Lando norrris now sees the crowd standing for him the Australian Grand Prix is going to be win number one in 2025 for Lando Norris he picks up where he left off in abui Norris wins managed the conditions U managed the team performance kept his cool was focused so who does that better through the course of the year I think will end up being uh the champion but for Oscar of course that&amp;#39;s his aspiration he&amp;#39;s a winner he goes out there two win races two win championships he&amp;#39;s got a great mentor in Mark Weber uh who is trying to help him navigate that path so it&amp;#39;s a young man&amp;#39;s game in Formula 1 we got six rookies on the grid this year the average age is probably 20 years old if Oscar is going to get it done certainly you would have to think that it&amp;#39;s going to be in the next two or three years whilst McLaren are the team on top Norris as you say ultimately prevailed from vapen and George Russell a huge storyline coming in was Lewis Hamilton in Ferrari red aesthetically gez it looked dreamy how did it look on track Jess oh it was incredible I mean the amount of support that Lewis has in Ferrari colors has been extraordinary hasn&amp;#39;t it uh there was a sea of reding amongst the Sea of papaya down there at Albert Park across the weekend and I was really interested to just keep an eye on Lewis and and watch how he sort of handled himself he didn&amp;#39;t do any media while he was down there was really trying to keep a low profile it&amp;#39;s on the record that he is just absolutely relishing the challenge of having to reinvent himself uh with Ferrari in red at this point in his career he&amp;#39;s highly credential to s time world champion and it&amp;#39;s sort of going back to basics for him and you could see that it was a challenge in the opening round for him trying to understand the car feel comfortable in the team and get into his Groove Le to got one point but um well did I get a point I don&amp;#39;t so yeah there was so much to to get accustomed to get used to I think the performance that we saw from him on the weekend tells us that he&amp;#39;s going to take some time until Lewis feels like it&amp;#39;s second nature there&amp;#39;s so much that goes on behind the scenes uh the engineers that he works with the language that they speak that sort of intuitive Rapport that you develop with people it&amp;#39;s all completely reset and totally new for Lewis uh in 2025 so it&amp;#39;s going to take some time but I think the opening round here in Australia was such a great learning curve for him and when they get to China next weekend he&amp;#39;ll be much better for this experience speaking of learning curves One driver who did not finish was Australian Jack Duan who last had left than a lap and there out is the race is Jack Doan one of the Australian Grand Prix and another rookie coming to grief in the early stages here safety car has been deployed is the alpan driver already under immense pressure to hold his seat at the team Just One race into the season that was so disappointing for Jack because I thought he did a brilliant job up to that point through the weekend and again the conditions were so tricky yesterday two out of six rookies actually finish the race when you&amp;#39;ve got Fernando Alonzo and Carlos Saints also crashing out in those conditions I think it tells you just how challenging it was so I thought Jack has handled himself so beautifully in the midst of all of this pressure that&amp;#39;s probably been piled on him unnecessarily and it was sort of heartwarming to hear Oliver Oaks the Alpine team boss come out and say you know what we actually have not helped Jack in any of this we did not need to apply any of this extra pressure it&amp;#39;s already tough coming into a rookie season in formula one and I caught up with Jack while I was down there and he&amp;#39;s taking it all in his stride he&amp;#39;s got some really good people around him he&amp;#39;s obviously got his dad Mick doam a famous U Moto GP Champion who&amp;#39;s mentoring him and helping him navigate the intense scrutiny and pressure that comes with performing at the highest level and he said to me Jess I&amp;#39;ve been a reserve driver I was breathing down the neck of the guy that had the seat that I wanted I understand what it&amp;#39;s like to be on the other side of it and now I&amp;#39;m sitting there with all that pressure and I&amp;#39;ve got to learn how to lean into it and use it to my advantage the pressure is something that you know we all have it&amp;#39;s a part of you know sport Motorsport at at at the top level um but for me it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s pretty easy to sort of manage that you know if I know that I&amp;#39;ve uh done everything possible in in my control I&amp;#39;m mentally fit I&amp;#39;m physically fit I&amp;#39;ve done my ground work spent time with the with the crew with the engineers all the mechanics then for me there you know on on my side there&amp;#39;s nothing to be worried about and I really thought he did that he outpaced his teammate Pier gazley through practice I thought he did a ripping job in qualifying uh to be right up there and to start uh from 14th on the grid it was such a shame that he wasn&amp;#39;t able to go on with it but again only two out of the six rookies this season actually finished the Australian Grand Prix so I hope that everyone&amp;#39;s been impressed with the way that Jax handled himself the way that he went about it in the early part of it and that they just backed the pressure off give him a chance to go out there and show us what he&amp;#39;s made of the world&amp;#39;s most glamorous circus heads to Shanghai

    "transcript": "a crypto Trader gets sandwich attack I messed up recording this and it&amp;#39;s going to have a lot of Reverb and I made this video because I really wanted to talk about sandwich attacks and yeah we got to do that with this clip to while making a stable coin swap losing over $215,000 essentially they lost about 98% of their transaction and we&amp;#39;re going to go over what happens and how you can protect yourself in the future from this happening to you now this is kind of a common problem whenever you&amp;#39;re trading in cryptocurrency especially when you&amp;#39;re on an evm chain that is something that uses the ethereum virtual machine these are ethereum un chain polygon optimism base all of those that use the evm framework they were trading usdc to usdt typically you don&amp;#39;t see much of a loss there but if they were using a swapping platform that doesn&amp;#39;t protect against these me attacks and they had the slippage very high then this is going to happen so so whenever you&amp;#39;re making a large transaction on an evm chain you want to be protected against these kinds of attacks and you want to make sure your slippage is very low now in this case their slippage was probably not set at all very likely they were trading mean coins that had a lot of slippage which means they needed to not have anything set so they can execute their traits now a lot of these are technical details that is only relevant to you if you are a defi user and want to get involved in all this type of stuff but uh yeah it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s very dangerous and it really only happens if you&amp;#39;re trading higher amounts significantly higher amounts and this does happen on layer 2 blockchains as well this happened to me on base so uh yeah this this happens everywhere so don&amp;#39;t think that just because you&amp;#39;re Layer Two blockchain is faster and cheaper that an me attack isn&amp;#39;t going to work now to better explain this attack which has been going viral on Twitter you could always look in the comments for additional clarification which we&amp;#39;re going to do now cuz someone explained it excellently yeah that&amp;#39;s a word all right for anyone wondering how this can happen with stable coins imagine you&amp;#39;re at a market buying a rare item and everyone can see your order before it&amp;#39;s cressed a sneaky Trader the me bot watches you and decides to profit off your move here&amp;#39;s how it plays out you place your order and you tell you to swap I want to swap $220,000 of usdc for usdt this order goes into the public Q the mle where anyone can see it the bot jumps in front front running that&amp;#39;s what it&amp;#39;s called when it front runs your order it gets ahead of you so its order can get processed before yours so the me bot quickly places its own order before yours it buys a bunch of usdt from another source or manipulates the Unis swap pool to drive up the price of usdt slightly this is like the bot buying up all the stock of that rare item making it more expensive right before you buy your trade executes when your swap happens because the bot pushed the usdt price up and you end up paying more usdc or less us DT basically a lot of slippage you didn&amp;#39;t get the trade that you think you were going to get so instead of getting $220,000 you got about $5,000 the bot sells after back running right after you trade the bot sells the usct it bot or manipulates the poll again profiting from the price difference it Pockets the extra value and here we lost $215,000 this sandwich attack happens because the bot places its buy order before yours and its sell order after yours so basically a sandwich that&amp;#39;s you here&amp;#39;s a buy order here&amp;#39;s a sell order you&amp;#39;re buying you&amp;#39;re doing your trade in between and it&amp;#39;s taking advantage of you which is why these are called sandwich attacks now you know more literally it&amp;#39;s not a sandwich attacking you it&amp;#39;s just the situation between the transactions this sandwich happens because the bot places its order before yours and it sell order after yours squeezing your trade in the middle and taking the profit you might wonder why this happened with stable coins which are supposed to be one to one even though stable coin pools on us swap have slight price imbalances due to liquidity and trading activity a large swap like $220,000 can ship these prices temporarily and Bots can exploit that tiny window even though it can happen in less than a second the best way to avoid a sandwich attack is to make your trades less attractive to me Bots by doing smaller trades low slippage High liquidity Pairs and use tools that high your transaction on the public menol private relays me aware dexes and if you&amp;#39;re looking for an me aware Dex that would be something like house swap it&amp;#39;s not 100% foolproof but these steps can significantly reduce your risk and we&amp;#39;re going to like that so that&amp;#39;s just essentially how sandwich attacks work and to protect yourself against this you want to verify what is happening in your transaction if you are on an evm chain like base and optimism and things like that you might want to use rabby wallet you want to do your swaps and you want to see what you&amp;#39;re going to get it&amp;#39;s going to show you you&amp;#39;re trading this much you&amp;#39;re going to get this much back so you want to be careful when you&amp;#39;re trading you want to make sure the slippage for your trade is set to a very low amount in most cases less than 3% and stay safe out there and and I guess uh if you have that much money to lose you want to be very careful about your trades even more or any DG out there well you know what happens when you make it you don&amp;#39;t want to lose it all in one transaction all right with that I hope you got your full value for today we this was a very long shot about just one uh issue but I just kind of felt like making a video and haven&amp;#39;t done that in a while so there you go",

doing the bare minimum work with within within the confines of probable cause can didn&amp;#39;t understand why K was helping out that woman who had tried to sue him and she looked at her reflection in the vanity and she didn&amp;#39;t like it and she said before running to clean the house and K had never cheated on her and he was too lazy or comfortable to find himself another woman whenever she

she also promised not to bother me every again regardless of the results of my investigation after all she is but a stranger who expect me to become her little love that&amp;#39;s just because of her beauty aha you admitted his Kina you think he is prettier than me Karina everything hurts and I don&amp;#39;t feel well please pleas protested came placing a pillow over his head it will take more than a bump on your head to kill you Kan said Karina coming over with one of her jealous RS and what the bimbo house that I don&amp;#39;t have get out of my house Kina y came sitting up Karina turned as white as a sheet and Kan Rose from the bed and the color from his face was completely gone Karina took a step back and Kan walked towards her Kina Clos her eyes expecting the words instead Kan staggered towards the battle to throw up his bright breakfast Kina ran for the phone and she called her mother the adrenaline search must be going down said unla his accident was really bad Kina why were you arguing with him what&amp;#39;s wrong with you I wasn&amp;#39;t arguing like Karina meekly don&amp;#39;t you think I don&amp;#39;t know my own daughter seriously Karina give the man time to decompress Karina hung up the phone and she tipped up back to the bedroom and she opened the door slowly she found K still throwing up even though his stomach was empty canina brought him a glass of water and got him back into bed and she proceeded to sanitize the bathroom studing with a toilet and she had inherited for her mother the compulsion to clean everything whenever she was nervous and while she cleaned she pondered what king had offered to help ohia and in her jealous Fury Furious the only conclusion she kept coming up to was that K had feelings Foria Karina I didn&amp;#39;t ask you to clean the bathroom mon K I want to sleep and the noise you keep making is making my headache worse Karina picked up the cleaning supplies and she made the ex effort of being as quiet as a mouse

it down but he was far too weary to leave the bed resign to his F came reach for his headset and he turn some classical music in order to drown of the noise with this measure he was able to fall asleep again Karina finished cutting the grass and she TR the hedges and she looked at her garden it work and she saw that it was good but nothing else to do Kina returned to the house to to the house to see if Kane was still breathing and then he had his head set on Kina returned to fastidiously clean the house and she saw Esther driving up the house and since she had and since her man was no

dreams Karina tried a bunch of different career pth while in high school and she eventually decided to become a pediatrician the first thing Kina did when she got home was inform her relatives that she was graduating and then night her family did an impr to party Barbara was always looking for an excuse to dra a big celebration and just a few days ago they had celebrated the wedding of their pet math like their little bird nobody bothered to inquire why Karina&amp;#39;s boyfriend was not at the party and since bar that Kina relationship was stagnant she decided to interfere and her interference came in the form of Bruno he was a lawyer friend of her older son Rodrigo Rodrigo and Bruno have been roomies and they had played college football together Rodrigo felt that his friend would be a good match for his cousin since both were allergic to Casual relationships and they had ridiculously high standards Karina drank and D and was Mary and she looked at Bruno over the top and she thought that her Aunt Barbara had excellent tast in man and there was something particularly Charming about about his discount she out beer and she also like his intense green eyes and his entire being emanated strength and determination and taking the initiative Bruto invited Kina to dance ranted about his work as a defense attorney while Kina bore him with her medical jargon and both were talking but not other of them were having a real conversation K didn&amp;#39;t know anything about the law while Bruno couldn&amp;#39;t find his prostate to save his own life you seem like a sharp

major tant what she demanded to see her daddy and the solution thata found was to redecorate the house to have a Ser as a vis reminder that their life was never going to be the same again that night Karina dreamed that she was cleaning the toilet and she looked up to the window and she saw the blood moon and blood began to see to the tiles and got how much Kina clean more and more blood St manifest Karina turned her head and she saw the open bathroom door and resting on top of the bed hooked up to machine was the shape of a man Karina wor walked towards the Seck bed but regardless of how much she walked she couldn&amp;#39;t reach him and the man turned his head to look at Karina and Kina was screaming Papa Kina was bathing a cold sweat and with a trembling hand she looked at the lamp light and when and with his gentle glow illuminated her bed she breathed a sigh of relief there was something childish about her choice of room decor and everything was a combination of soft pastels pinks and yellows her book sh was dominated by medical Tes and beneath it there were the art books and fashion magazines and other visual mediums K wasn&amp;#39;t much of a reader though she like to browse through art books the only totens for her childhood that she kept was the dollhouse and we would amuse her to R decorated and the current residence of the dollhouse was her tiny bunny

her pillow Kina mve her pillow toward the other side of the bed and that way the Moonlight would fall on her feet instead of her face and she closed the blinds again and she attempted to fall asleep Nana they said that little bunny Lees on the moon said Karina talking to her plushing the bunny is constantly grounding her needed to make the elixir of immortality for the gods they sure keep him busy said Nana Nana didn&amp;#39;t speak rather Kina outed her voice to make to make a sound like since the bunny was speaking Nana do you think K is all right as Kina why do you care and you more interested in green eyed Bruno as Nana Bruno that man is such a bore said Karina I told wish he didn&amp;#39;t have green eyes green eyes are my favorite Kina fell asly thinking about Bruno&amp;#39;s green eyes and she had work an hour before noon and she had overslept and she left her bed and she started to look for Nana and as flipping the bed and all of the cover she saw that the bunnie had fallen from the bed while she had thss and turn at night Kina returned the Bonnie to her dollhouse and she wasn&amp;#39;t in the mood to go rest residence hunting right away she decided to take the rest of July as sabatical Kina took her morning bath and she had theight breakfast and she went to the main house to see if they if her stay at home mom mirror was around and there was a not on the phrase that said that she had taken the kiss and her cousins to the beach to the beach and says nobody was at home she checked her messages Bruno had not had not called to check up on her and she call

mouth but Karina wasn&amp;#39;t able to hear what he said and the crashing of the way Dr the the sound of his voice the man began to walk towards the ocean and Kina was left behind in the safety of the shore and she saw that the man was walking deeper and deeper till he disappeared beneath the waves the waves retreated before crashing right on top of Gina and when she awoke her head was

    "transcript": "hi star andno uh and thanks for joining uh me this morning uh I&amp;#39;ve got my green screen on because I&amp;#39;ve got uh some big light behind me so I don&amp;#39;t wanted to wash out the camera through up the uh Boulder flat irons those are the uh iconic uh mountains kind of um here in Boulder Colorado where I live so today we&amp;#39;re got an interesting topic uh same format as usual I&amp;#39;m going to go ahead and spend some time going through a uh short lecture 10 15 minutes something like that uh and then from there we&amp;#39;ll go to uh answering questions uh any questions you want questions that are uh invol questions that are involving this topic questions that are involving any topic you want really doesn&amp;#39;t make a difference to me um so today we&amp;#39;re going to talk about how to self- diagnose the cause of headaches coming from your neck um this is a big one because lots and lots of CCI patients have headaches coming from the neck and lots of patients without CCI have headaches coming from the neck it&amp;#39;s a very common thing but very few patients I find these days get a specific diagnosis of which structure is causing the problem and until we know which structure is causing the the problem there&amp;#39;s absolutely no way to treat that structure to get rid of the headache so uh I find that many patients just kind of wander around so if I can do something this morning to try to teach patients uh a little bit so that they can maybe try to say huh I wonder if it is my c1c2 facet joint or my lust Rock Cal nerve or my superficial cervical plexus that&amp;#39;s causing my headache and then hopefully they&amp;#39;ll be able to navigate the medical care system better so uh title uh this morning is how self diagnose the cause of headaches originating from the neck so I want you to like comment share subscribe here just because that&amp;#39;s how we get this content out to more patients um if you&amp;#39;ve been lucky enough to find this weekly uh broadcast with Q&amp;amp;A uh that&amp;#39;s great but obviously for every one of you that have found there&amp;#39;s hundred that haven&amp;#39;t and the only way to make sure that other patients can find it is to do things like like comment share subscribe um also again as I always mention um we&amp;#39;ve got two different social media sites threads that I recommend um there&amp;#39;s lots out there um some are better than others uh but there&amp;#39;s a lot of misinformation going back and forth um on a lot of different social media threads so these are two I can highly recommend one is my uh subreddit uh rpic or pic subreddit on on Reddit um it&amp;#39;s Q&amp;amp;A with me there&amp;#39;s literally hundreds of questions on there that I&amp;#39;ve answered I answer them seven days a week um and uh getting bigger and bigger as time goes on uh as of this morning we had 224 members on there and um my guess is by end of the year will be at least 500 to 700 uh again that&amp;#39;s Q&amp;amp;A with me and then there&amp;#39;s a patient only Q&amp;amp;A on Facebook cervical instability pic procedure that&amp;#39;s a Facebook thread that I can highly recommend uh the folks that run it are very serious about trying to keep it uh very focused trying to keep the answers high quality um so both of those spaces are obviously different one is Q&amp;amp;A with me on Reddit the other is Q&amp;amp;A um with just between patients but very knowledgeable patients on this uh Facebook uh pic procedure uh thread so two different threads there so most headache treatment worldwide is systemic and what I mean by that is that for example it&amp;#39;s take this medication um the problem is uh if it works the physician really has no idea what&amp;#39;s causing the headache and um the patient usually needs to take that medication forever uh now most medications have substantial or significant side effects so um that&amp;#39;s concerning right um you would think that it&amp;#39;d be far better if someone could figure out the cause of the headache and treat that cause but all too often again it&amp;#39;s just throw medications at the problem um headaches that come from the neck are called cervicogenic so what that means is that um they basically generate from the head in Latin uh this is a very very underdiagnosed uh type of headache cervicogenic headaches are very common uh I would guess that when it comes to chronic headaches they literally um are about 50% of all chronic headaches out there um but they get diagnosed less than 10% of the time why do they get diagnosed so uh infrequently uh it&amp;#39;s often because neurologists are asked to see headache patients and neurologists are not trained how a diagn how a diagnose cervicogenic headache it&amp;#39;s just not part of the training they get so oftentimes we see patients with um headaches coming from their neck or cogenic headaches and they have no idea that that&amp;#39;s coming from their neck and in fact many times the patients are the ones who say yeah I wonder if this is coming from my neck because every time I do this I seem to get a headache and not the doctor so most patients don&amp;#39;t understand that there are a long list of structures in the neck that can cause headaches upper cervical faet joints occipital nerve superficial cervical plexus I think cervical spelled wrong there I&amp;#39;m gonna fix that because that drives me a little crazy uh let me just fix that guys here we go uh superficial cervical plexus subal muscles rectus capus poster and minor through the myodural bridge increased interanal hypertension inflamed iy cervical Bas lots of things that can cause headaches coming from the neck um so if we can identify one of these structur es then we can Target that structure and we can treat that structure and get rid of the headaches so in other words a specific diagnosis equals a specific treatment and no more headaches it&amp;#39;s pretty simple thing actually I mean this has been going on in the world of Interventional pain management now for three decades despite that probably only about one in five uh headache sufferers who has headaches coming from their neck actually gets access to any kind of specific diagnosis and specific treatment so it&amp;#39;s a little sad to see when I go online and see all these patients suffering from severe headaches and most of them just have no idea that it could be originating from a structure in their neck so figuring out which structures to Target with injections to heal that structure can be done by combining history which is talking to the patient right where does it hurt what makes it hurt uh Etc Imaging um which structure looks abnormal so that can give you some Clues uh and then a Hands-On exam uh can we find specifically where it hurts or other AB abnormalities on exam that relate to that structure so uh to help you self- diagnose the structure today we&amp;#39;ll focus on the History part right that&amp;#39;s the part that you can do at home that&amp;#39;s the part that you know um you know your own body you know where it hurts you know where it doesn&amp;#39;t hurt you know what makes it worse what makes it better um so that&amp;#39;s where we&amp;#39;re going to focus now for example this is a map of where specific neck facet joints refer pain and as you can see here um we&amp;#39;ve got the c0 C1 Facet Joint that refers pain up in here and then the C1 C2 Facet Joint there the c23 Facet Joint there c34 in here c45 in there the c56 Facet Joint over here and then the c67 Facet Joint here in the upper back so as you might imagine then if you&amp;#39;ve got headache pain coming from a facet uh or if you&amp;#39;ve got pain coming from an upper neck facet better said it refers pain into your head if you&amp;#39;ve got pain coming from a mid cervical facet it&amp;#39;s the neck or the upper trap if you&amp;#39;ve got uh pain from a lower cervical facets it&amp;#39;s kind of the upper back um so uh this map has been around for a very long time since the 1990s and most Interventional spine Physicians use it but family doctors don&amp;#39;t use it the surgeons barely use it neurologists don&amp;#39;t use it so realize that if you want to get a specific diagnosis you&amp;#39;re going to have to see someone that focuses on targeting specific structures to treat the pain um so let&amp;#39;s focus on three specific headaches that tie back to the structures that can be easily treated with precise orthobiologic injections so we&amp;#39;re going to go with three specific structures today upper cervical facets the occipital nerves and The Superficial cervical plexus now you saw my longer list there&amp;#39;s at least 10 things or a dozen things really on that list but these are the three most common that we see in CCI patients and the three most common that we see and just patients walking in with headaches coming from their neck so let&amp;#39;s start first with upper cervical facets right those are uh these are all joints in your neck they&amp;#39;re about the size of a finger joint um and there are two one on each side one on the right one on the left there are well don&amp;#39;t know why my uh camera just uh I&amp;#39;m assuming everyone can still hear me but looks like my camera went out for some reason there no idea why there um hold on a quick second guys I&amp;#39;m GNA try to fix that camera well I&amp;#39;m assuming you guys are still hearing me if not let me know I am monitoring the comments um but not quite sure why the camera went out but hopefully you can still hear me so oper cervical facets are about the size of a finger joint uh they allow normal neck motion uh the good uh they allow normal neck motion cervical facets can be injured and then refer pain to specific regions specific regions of the neck uh head and upper back the c0 through C C3 facet joins can becomes painful and swollen in CCI patients and they can cause headaches disiness imbalance and brain fog so the upper neck facet joint are a big cause of headache pain and lots of other symptoms um so if we look at c0 C1 and c23 um what we can see here is that c0 C1 and c23 kind of refer pain to the back of the head uh c23 a little bit lower includes a little bit of the upper neck c0 C1 more than just the back of the head but it&amp;#39;s going to be hard to differentiate these two um with regard to is it the C C1 uh or the c23 uh facet joid now um how you can differentiate this perhaps is the c23 is more commonly associated with dizziness imbalance and brain fog the CC1 is uh more associated with a type 1 C sliding of the skull on the atlas type uh cran cervical instability and the c23 uh is more associated with CCI types 3A and 3B so that&amp;#39;s when you have movement happening at c23 uh now c1c2 facet headaches are pretty pathom monic and what I mean by that is that they they&amp;#39;re this little spot here so they tend to go right along the base of the skull and across the base of the skull um so it&amp;#39;s pretty easy usually to diagnose a c1c2 facet headache because of this specific pattern that&amp;#39;s very different than the 01 pattern and very different than the 23 pattern again this one two pattern is right across the base of the skull and it&amp;#39;s also true that the C1 C2 facet headaches are associated with CCI types 2A and 2B so remember 2A is the one where there&amp;#39;s gaping uh in the ADI usually in flexion and the 2B is the one where there&amp;#39;s uh side to side instability on a DMX at C1 C2 so as far as treatment is concerned if it&amp;#39;s due to instability then treat the facet joint and the instability if there&amp;#39;s no instability then just treat the facet joint and these are precise floride injections of orth of biologics using uh digital subtraction angiography for 01 and one two um so you can treat these joints all day long or twice on Sunday it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s it takes a little skill obviously uh in experien to do the higher ones but the two3 fetuin can be widely treated without that additional level of skill without digital subtraction angiography and if it&amp;#39;s causing headache pain it&amp;#39;s a home run you inject that two three joint um with something corticosteroids can be used but it hurts the joint but it&amp;#39;s a potent anti-inflammatory obviously PRP would be better to use but the headache just goes away so it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s always been interesting to me to see patients out there who probably have facet pain headaches and they&amp;#39;ve never had it treated so we&amp;#39;re going to go now to occipital nerves and occipital nerves these nerves weave through the suboccipital muscles they innervate the back uh and side of the head these headaches usually can be made worse by placing pressure in the sub aiple area but they can also be made better by doing that so lots of patients will put pressure in the back of their skull kind of just beneath the skull in the suboccipital area and that&amp;#39;s going to be putting pressure in this area in here and if that makes your headache worse or if it makes your headache better it could be occipital nerve headaches this is called occipital neuralgia uh and they often have a nervy type presentation burning skin sensitivity and toolerance to pressure on the scalp is what usually causes uh or how these headaches present so for example a oxyon neurologia patient will generally have a hard time putting any pressure on the back of their skull uh or they can&amp;#39;t you know lie uh with a pillow there on the back of their skull because it hurts or it bothers them um and they can also trigger occipital frontal meaning from the back to the front of the head kind of headaches so greater versus leral nerves um you know there&amp;#39;s lots of different Maps out there uh the research shows that it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s a little bit all over the place but bottom line is the greater exelo nerve tends to go more in the back of the head the Lesser exip nerve is kind of on the side of the back of the head side of the head and in little bit into the ear so uh that&amp;#39;s how you differentiate these two now it&amp;#39;s pretty easy to palpate these for an experienced provider to figure out if it&amp;#39;s greater or less upper nerve and we do that all the time uh then you&amp;#39;ve got realized a third ex simple nerve that comes up right in the middle here um so you&amp;#39;ve got a greater exle nerve that&amp;#39;s here a lesser ex simple nerve that&amp;#39;s there um and then you&amp;#39;ve got this third exle nerve coming right up the middle or the the the midline of the skull now again if did instability then treat the oxy nerve and the instability if there&amp;#39;s no instability then just the oipal nerve ultrasound guided Hydro dissection of the nerve with third generation PL late is how this is treated so this is actually one of the more common hro dissection we do we can see either the inferior uh oblique uh or the rectus capitus posterior major here um and we HR dissect in this plane right where the greater ex nerve lives now you know the good news is that the suboccipital nerve is also here as well um the suboccipital nerve provides intervation to the sub oipal muscles so you kind of get a twofer if you hyr disect this entire plane out here under ultrasound guidance you&amp;#39;re getting not only the G nerve uh but you&amp;#39;re also picking up the suboc nerve that inates meaning supplies power to the sub oipal muscle so you get a twofer with that type of uh oxal nerve hyro dissection um and then finally The Superficial cervical plexus so The Superficial cervical plexus is uh interated by C2 through C four it&amp;#39;s the uh it lives underneath the sternomastoid and comes out the back of the sternomastoid muscle here and there&amp;#39;s a Le it becomes the Lesser OIP nerve and then the greater arular nerve and then it provide and then it becomes the transverse cervical nerve which provides sensation to the um front side of the neck and then finally the super scapular nerve which provides sensation over the clavicle so tightness in the sternic mastoids which is very common in CCI patients can cause this sort of issue um and uh in addition to that because the vagus nerve lives in the same place uh you can also get anomic symptoms when you have irritation The Superficial cervical plexus and then many patients find that massaging the sternomastoid muscle or PL ing pressure there can again make their symptoms better or worse so headaches with pain or we Sensations in the outside back of the head side of the neck or ear is really what we&amp;#39;re talking about here so this is the distribution of all of those nerves coming uh out of the back of the sternomastoid and for a headache it&amp;#39;s kind of a side of the head into the ear and and or could also in include other parts of the ear or parts of the anterior neck or over the clavical area so again as far as treating this if it&amp;#39;s du instability then treat The Superficial cervical plexus and the instability if no instability then just The Superficial cervical plexus uh this is ultrasound guided higher dissection of the plexus underneath the stern Clin mastoid which is what I&amp;#39;m doing in this picture here so in some specific diagnosis equals specific treatment no more headaches to do this you&amp;#39;ve got to find the structure that&amp;#39;s causing the headache then you have to treat that structure with something that can prompt healing in the structure and hopefully this helps patients today get some clues about which structures might be causing their headaches going forward um I think I&amp;#39;m just going to go start to answer questions uh let me see if I can see if if I can figure out the deal with the camera looks like it&amp;#39;s thinking on the camera there in the meantime let me start pulling some questions up here um Jessica James best uh supplements for ligament healing um I don&amp;#39;t really have any uh recommendations for supplements for ligament healing we don&amp;#39;t have any data on that we&amp;#39;ve got pretty good data on supplements that can help with joints uh that&amp;#39;s been well studied but there&amp;#39;s really no clinical research that I&amp;#39;m aware of for supplements that can help with ligament healing some common sense ones might be things like collagen but we really don&amp;#39;t know that for sure so I&amp;#39;m not quite sure I can make great recommendations there um for ligament healing other than if you have uh chronic high systemic inflammation the supplements that can reduce that systemic inflammation are important and those supplements include things like uh curcumin fish oil Etc so that&amp;#39;s perhaps one strategy there uh Jessica can Kari get worse over time like with an injury or the malformation is what it is until it becomes symptomatic yeah it&amp;#39;s usually the malformation is what it is until it becomes symptomatic and most patient now obviously there&amp;#39;s a different category of Kari that we&amp;#39;re often not talking about here and those are usually kids with Kari that have Kari 2 and three where the uh the back of the brain is is well very deep into the upper cervical spinal canal but that&amp;#39;s usually not the kind of kar we&amp;#39;re talking about here we&amp;#39;re talking about zeros and ones usually in CCI patients Cheryl when I look up I have extreme pain at the back of my skull all between my between the ears yeah so that could be a 01 Facet Joint that&amp;#39;s something to think about a01 Facet Joint uh asthma maybe asthma ow hi Dr Ken we have the oxop put stuck in extension would this be caused by the ligaments or the muscles what is normal distance between the oxit and poster arch of C1 uh there is no normal distance between the oxit and the poster arch of C1 uh that&amp;#39;s never been studied of which I&amp;#39;m aware uh that&amp;#39;s in fact one of the things that Dr Katz and I have talked about a few times as to whether or not we wanted to um try to study it because as far as I know no one&amp;#39;s ever published on it before uh as far as the oxy put stuck in extension uh that would usually be to a type due to a type um one uh one b or one C CCI where there&amp;#39;s some instability in the uh front of the coc1 joint uh there are ligaments there that can get injured or there are some uh issues with there not being enough downward Force bringing the oxop put into the atlas and or the oxop put is very very uh shallow so there&amp;#39;s all different things that could cause something like that Stephen if uh I only have crine cervical syndrome can I expect syic results poster PRP um yeah I mean usually for cranos cervical syndrome patients uh posterior PRP helps but again we need to Define that right uh very important to realize that posterior PRP at clinics outside of centenno Schultz is probably going to be very different than posterior PRP at centenno Schultz so for for example if you have a cren cervical syndrome that&amp;#39;s usually injecting the c0 C1 the c1c2 the c23 facet joint and in injecting those facet joints um we would need to um do that under fluoroscopy with contrast confirmation and digital subtraction angiography and then obviously you can inject lots of other ligaments and structures that might be involved that&amp;#39;s going to be very different than if you go get uh poster jections with quote Prolotherapy or someone is not using fluoroscopy and they&amp;#39;re just trying to do an under ultrasound Etc so wide wide differences in what&amp;#39;s considered a posterior injection at various clinics Jessica your expert opinion is uh C1 C2 Fusion of waste because most people have to go back and fuse their skull too um yeah I I I think you probably want to fuse as few levels as possible um so I don&amp;#39;t think c1c2 Fusion alone is a waste you&amp;#39;re right and that you&amp;#39;re probably going to eventually get in most people adjacent segment disease above uh at c0 C1 um but I think that if you can avoid the CC1 Fusion let&amp;#39;s say it&amp;#39;s 5050 uh that&amp;#39;s better than not so uh probably a good idea to fuse as little as possible uh I think last time this was pronounced like Andrea Andrea um op on getting an upright shoulder elbow and wrist MRI had a shoulder incident uh before developing CCI but Sensations typically feel on the nerve with motion deteriorate upon getting uh CCI um yeah so I think if you&amp;#39;re going to get your uh shoulder done and your elbow and your wrist those would be better with closed bore MRI uh 1.5 Tesla rather then a low Field open meaning that all of the opens are going to be uh including all of the uprights are going to be lower field magnet so I think you&amp;#39;d want to go for a higher field magnet meaning a closed MRI to get the Shoulder uh the elbow and uh the wrist Andrea how useful are evoke potentialist method diagnosis uh aspects of CC CCI at all usually not at all helpful uh very unlikely that evoke potentials are going to help trying to think what you could try to use them for I guess you could try to use them to see if someone has um cervical magary syndrome meeting pressure of the dens on the um medulla or the brain stem I think the problem there is it&amp;#39;s going to be less reliable than looking at something like diffusion tensor Imaging uh a specialized MRI through that area where you could see actual fiber disruption uh Stephen how significant composter PRP be for some surface of OIP neuralgia if PRP can TR neuralgia at all yes Steph so it can be added but again realize that you have to do a very specialized hyro dissection of the occipital nerves um with that so that&amp;#39;s what we would do at senteno Schultz but the likelihood of you getting that just out there in the wild is small uh meaning that that&amp;#39;s a very specialized procedure that the doctor has to learn how to do uh at a very specific area that needs to be treated asthma Al pain at the base of the skull can be caused by irritated nerves rectus capus and Joint capsules how can the muscle and capsule be seen on Imaging uh we don&amp;#39;t have a lot of data that the joint capsules participate at all in causing headache pain um so that&amp;#39;s not accurate uh medically even though you might have heard that from somebody uh the rectus capitus posterior minor um is the one I think you&amp;#39;re thinking of and that Jacks into the myodural bridge and that can cause headache um and uh as far as rectus capus postor minor I have a whole YouTube on that one um let&amp;#39;s see if I can um find it for you um let me go and uh switch the share here uh let&amp;#39;s see here so if you go to my uh YouTube channel on the videos here you&amp;#39;ll uh be able to scroll down there and this is one on the myodural bridge here um talks about the myodural bridge uh there&amp;#39;s also one in here that talks about the rectus capitus posterior minor so that&amp;#39;s another one um to look at as well so those are different uh ones on my YouTube channel if you guys don&amp;#39;t subscribe to my YouTube channel uh hop on there and subscribe um if you&amp;#39;re on YouTube now hit the like share comment all that good stuff uh Cheryl if someone gets the p and posterior injections uh where they need to come back within four to six weeks more posterior PRP treatment with the B as well at the back thank you yeah so normally we do not do additional posterior treatment in that four to six week range um I don&amp;#39;t think there&amp;#39;s any need to based on uh how it is we&amp;#39;re doing these treatments meaning that I know there&amp;#39;s lots of clinics that&amp;#39;ll inject every four weeks but they&amp;#39;re not injecting the same doses of PRP we are they&amp;#39;re not able to put those PRP into specific areas so they&amp;#39;re basically relying on frequency of treatment to make up for uh injecting inferior stuff and injecting it less precisely so you don&amp;#39;t need another treatment at four to six weeks uh Stephen thoughts on what could be going on with pounding heartbeat headache only in the back of the head yeah so that that could be occipital uh artery there occipital artery runs with the occipital nerve so realize that that that could be possible there that that&amp;#39;s what you&amp;#39;re dealing with um uh before I take the next question again I&amp;#39;m going to put in another plug plug for uh Reddit um please join us here on Reddit we&amp;#39;ve got 224 patients that have joined us so far um this is all things CCI all things pic um I jump on here seven days a week and answer questions um patient questions and it&amp;#39;s a great place if you&amp;#39;ve got questions on pic because you can search anything up here on things that have been answered um prior uh Carol Yates Advance by Harry would headaches originating in the neck need to come from a neck injury or could they also come from a neck abnormality you were born with usually a neck injury uh well it&amp;#39;s theoretically possible that you might um have something you were born with that&amp;#39;s GNA be much much less likely Jessica so if you have AAR ligament problems since AAR connects C2 to skull how is instabil only uh shown on c1c2 lateral movement yeah so there&amp;#39;s two things that are being shown when you see c1c2 lateral movement uh AAR ligament controls rotation and a proxy for that rotation is that lateral movement that we do c1c2 overhang on AP lateral bending DMX fuse uh the accessory ligament can also control c1c2 so we&amp;#39;re really measuring U the AAR ligament and the accessory realize that the AAR also um sandwiches in if you will the atlas between the skull and C2 um so that&amp;#39;s another way that it&amp;#39;s controlling motion at everything from c0 C1 to C c1c2 um Jessica so in your expert opinion to pick three important components to hopefully one day for your person from CCI may ask what those would be um yeah number one is get a specific diagnosis on the specific type of CCI you have I.E which ligaments are involved number two is Target those ligaments with injections number three is um obviously the ligaments and other structures that are causing symptoms uh as we&amp;#39;ve gone over today lots of things can cause headaches um and then the third is get strong meaning um try to work on the core musculature to support the head on the neck um asthma L uh what could be the reason for the sand rubbing noise run c01 when you turn your head that could be a CCI type 1D um that&amp;#39;s rotational instability at c0 C1 so that&amp;#39;s something that um could be um something we want to take a look at um video now workking asthma can you have pain at the base of the skull and a feeling of compression and stiffness but without any ligaments of upper neck being damaged yeah uh absolutely that would be more crenos cervical syndrome um and that could be the CZ C1 Facet Joint the c1c2 facet ET joint the c23 Facet Joint any all three of those sub oipal muscles Etc uh Colleen my son uh in-law suffers from unbearable headaches and they now found a spinal leak and he thoughts on interterm relief or best longterm relief uh Remedy or just surgery yeah colen a lot depends on number one is the spinal leak causing the headache realize that finding Spa a leaks on Imaging is very very hard to do and then number two uh would be uh whether or not uh it&amp;#39;s in a place where you could treat it with um PRP or a blood patch uh if it isn&amp;#39;t a place where you can treat it with PRP and a blood patch then injection makes sense first because that can take care of a large chunk of spinal leaks you&amp;#39;re basically just injecting stuff into the area to both plug the leak but also heal the hole um then obviously if that doesn&amp;#39;t work surgery would be the way to go um Stephen hoping to get relief posterior PRP Las Vegas they only offer C1 through C7 I&amp;#39;ve been cerning treatment 12h hour drive for me m County Arizona is a way I can effectively treat zerone with poster for my self suspect except on um yeah so Stephen um uh that&amp;#39;s certainly going to be good I&amp;#39;m hoping that they&amp;#39;re going to be injecting those facet joints normally it&amp;#39;s C1 or it&amp;#39;s the skull base through C7 for the posterior ligaments and then for the facet joints themselves um the facet joints themselves are usually going to be the upper cervical facets there&amp;#39;s really no reason to inject all the neck facet joints so I&amp;#39;m not quite sure what you&amp;#39;re describing there but I think that&amp;#39;s going to be a step up certainly from going to a clinic that is just going to do some blind ligament injections Cas iner the facet Maps incomplete given the facets can lead to my fessional involvement with different referral pains um yeah case I don&amp;#39;t think that&amp;#39;s accurate U not quite sure where you got that one from um facet joints don&amp;#39;t usually lead to my fascial involvement um they&amp;#39;re very specific referral patterns Jessica so pain and resistance and turning your head to the left if you have a low-lying tonsil something be hitting that makes that pain happen it can Jessica but be very careful meaning at the end of the day um the uh there&amp;#39;s much much more common things that can cause what you&amp;#39;re describing than lwh hanging cerebel or tonsils um so that would be at the very bottom of the list of things that could cause that uh higher up of the list would be things like c1c2 cren cervical instability a c1c2 facet F joint a specific occipital nerve uh one of the sub oipal muscles so a long list of things well well before low hanging cerebal tonsils REI law to hyy hope you&amp;#39;re well I have this exact issue neurologia trying to treat as much as you can with that surgery yep uh gotcha Andrea uh when you mention the SCM AR tingling Sensations the base of the SCM where it meets the clavicle a part of this yeah they can be because that can be the transverse cervical nerve um or the super clavicular nerve but realize that is a uh that that area is interated by the nerves that come out of the um back of the SC re I have two plastic surgeons who only do uh except nerve decompression but they know nothing of CCR instability my major concern is to do surgery exp me Fusion time muscles be manipulated yeah re I think as we&amp;#39;ve talked about you know you wouldn&amp;#39;t want to do the surgery unless you uh knew specifically that it was the oipal nerve so that&amp;#39;s differential blocks uh there to try to figure out where the oipal nerves are getting compressed or an Mr neurogram Mr neurography can uh identify specific areas where the exip nerves might be getting uh compressed in addition to that then you would do follow-up blocks and let&amp;#39;s say it&amp;#39;s the uh gter ex nerve um in at the rectus capus posterior major so you would do a plane block at the rectus capus posterior major see if that takes the headaches away and then you would know to go after that spot um Cheryl uh if a patient was International had instability in the hip would you use a stronger treatment to save them less travel over back to Colorado yeah sure we frequently treat um lots of different parts and pieces within the body so at the end of the day just realize that we&amp;#39;re not only treating uh the cren cervical instability usually usually we&amp;#39;re treating other things so we would just treat the hip at the same time in all likelihood unless you&amp;#39;re a fragile egg patient and you won&amp;#39;t tolerate two areas and that&amp;#39;s more rare maybe one in 10 of our patients Andrea is deterioration of CCI inevitable if left untreated um that&amp;#39;s generally what we see in most patients that had it for a while yes it tends to get worse not better now having said that there are patients that can bend that curve by doing all types of conservative care and there are some people where it just seems to get better over time so you know realize that uh you know that&amp;#39;s not everybody um uh Melissa is there any correlation to pain and the V2 Branch or the trimeter of Max lary and the neck or is it highly unlikely yeah Melissa I think what you&amp;#39;re talking about is that there&amp;#39;s some overlap between headaches that involve the trial nerve and some of the other structures uh there&amp;#39;s even a ganglion involved in all of that uh where there&amp;#39;s some theories that there&amp;#39;s some cross talk between the two um so there could be correlation there realize this could more cause sinus headaches because V2 innervates the inside of the sinus so a sinus headache without there being a sinus infection would probably be more related to the V2 branch of the trial nerve uh it&amp;#39;s been Advanced by Roberto do you have any doctors in Spain uh no no one to recommend recommend in Spain for this kind of stuff regrettably uh now does muscle spasm go away on its own once instability is reduced or is that something we need to work on Via manual therapy usually muscle spasm goes away on its own uh once once uh the instability is reduced uh Andrea thanks for the input of potentials if this kind of testing pointed to a delayed signal in the upper cervical area uh what can this indicate yeah I mean usually it&amp;#39;s not that specific Andrea so what I mean by that is that at the end of the day it&amp;#39;s not going to point to the upper cervical area regrettably um more likely than not what you&amp;#39;re going to get is somewhere along this pathway from the brain to where we measured the evoked potential there&amp;#39;s an issue but it&amp;#39;s not going to be able to point to to the specific upper cervical area at all um with an evoked potential it&amp;#39;s one of the problems with with evoked potential is they don&amp;#39;t give you that kind of information that&amp;#39;s why I was saying a diffusion tensor image could give you that kind of information it could focus on the function of the nerves right there where the den seems to be compressing the medulla and a Pondo cord and could literally pinpoint it to that spot um Stephen had a zoom call with you at Mid 2024 had poor DMX image quality you asked me to redo it which I did during my zoom call with you you have mentioned I zero after I redid second DMX received an email from your assistant saying plainly I&amp;#39;ve got CCI type 2B I feel like I need another Zoom with you or if you can please go over my case and elaborate more on car zero my type 2B um yeah so Stephen the best thing to do and what I offer everyone that does a zoom call with me is just to reach out via email um and I&amp;#39;ll be certainly happy to take another look at your information but it sounds pretty simple right I mean at the end of the day I think what you&amp;#39;re talking about is you&amp;#39;ve got cran cervical instability and a k zero um if you go to my YouTube channel um and you go just search under kiari I talk I have a number of videos that talk a lot about uh different things in kiari and basically the concept is simple and that is that kiari zero is a normal variant there&amp;#39;s lots of people walking around with Ki zero that have no problems they live their life with no issues no problems and then they get instability in the upper cervical spine and it&amp;#39;s like putting gasoline on a bonfire so they get many more symptoms so I think um that&amp;#39;s really the discussion I would have with you is that it&amp;#39;s a 1 plus one equals 3 situation uh you&amp;#39;re really not a candidate for posterior injections if you&amp;#39;ve got a type 2B because that&amp;#39;s very unlikely to help so I think you&amp;#39;re you&amp;#39;re probably wasting some money there by trying to treat it with posterior injections because in our experience that only works about one in five times um you really need to get more of a pic procedure but uh I think you have my email but if you don&amp;#39;t I&amp;#39;ll put it down here in the comments uh let&amp;#39;s see here should be going into the comments now wherever you are but just send me an email directly and I&amp;#39;ll I&amp;#39;ll go back um probably Monday would be a good time to ping me Monday morning because I&amp;#39;m in the office and I can go back and pull up all your old Imaging and take a look at it and uh and advise you the best I can um but normally you don&amp;#39;t need to do a second Zoom call just literally reach out to me via email I probably answer a 100 patient emails a week um I&amp;#39;m unique in that most doctors usually don&amp;#39;t do that um or they have their staff do that but I I try to do it as much as I can myself Cheryl doctor want to move my head to the left or right can I I can feel a grind on my upper neck and I feel extremely dizzy yeah so that sounds more like a c1c2 um facet injury uh that could be related to instability uh at c1c2 or at Lano axial instability now could be other things as well so I can&amp;#39;t diagnose based on a sentence uh over the internet but just realize that those are the kind of things that you would start to look for so what are the next steps there in trying to make that diagnosis next steps would be obviously getting a neck MRI see if there&amp;#39;s anything going on there that&amp;#39;s really big if there&amp;#39;s nothing on the neck MRI than getting movement based Imaging an upright MRI with flexion extension for example a digital motion x-ray flexion extension x-rays those sorts of things uh Asma how is 1D inst stability detected we can see it an MRI or CBT flection extension uh cbct with rotation uh could possibly find it we&amp;#39;d be looking for more than 8 degrees of c0 C1 rotation right or left um you could also theoretically do it with a rotational MRI as well uh I think we&amp;#39;ve already answered this one um uh yeah so I think you got my email uh and Andrea uh but would you say that an operate MRI of the shoulder elbow no I wouldn&amp;#39;t there&amp;#39;s no Advantage do an upright MRI of your shoulder elbow or wrist at all um you&amp;#39;d be far better doing a closed uh a closed bore MRI of those structures there&amp;#39;s just no advantage to gravity there Cheryl that&amp;#39;s great can you treat multiple ears at the same time so with the hip instability only need one treatment yeah so I I would need to look show at the the actual issue need to perform Hands-on Physical exam hip memorize Etc and then I could give you some sense of that uh Zach I have Fai with a pincer uh I want to get damaged hip flavor repair the stem cells the grand Cay Clinic should I have the impingement removed for the stem cell procedure no because Fai with pincer is normal uh what I mean by that is that uh a pincer type impingement uh forms in order to protect the joint so it&amp;#39;s protective of the The Joint so removing it would hurt the joint so you don&amp;#39;t want to remove it even though the surgeons have this thing where they love to remove anything fi related that&amp;#39;s not science-based regrettably in this particular situation rishia if you met any CCI patients told you ex Mur surgery made them feel more unstable lots and lots Rishi which is why I think we&amp;#39;ve had had that conversation um we&amp;#39;ve seen lots and lots of decompression patients who have had CCI Through The Years uh that&amp;#39;s my email address that goes to my desk um so I think I was talking to Stephen about that uh centenno office at centenno Schultz is not a general email it&amp;#39;s the specific email that goes to my my desk only Zach want the impingement Reiner the labor after the repair uh no Zach the there isn&amp;#39;t any impingement that&amp;#39;s a fiction uh meaning at the end of the day uh the type of um quote impingement you&amp;#39;re describing really is an impingement it&amp;#39;s a response of the hip joint to try to protect the joint so there&amp;#39;s no rationale to remove it um so it&amp;#39;s not an impingement even though the surgeons call it an impingement it is merely a protective bone spur that is formed to try to protect your joint so removing that bone spur is a dumb idea um not at all um supported by the science uh now if you had a severely um small hip joint for this for the ball so if the socket was too small uh or hip dysplasia then you could make an argument that reconstructing the hip may be worth it uh with surgery but that what you&amp;#39;re describing isn&amp;#39;t impingement even though it&amp;#39;s called one it&amp;#39;s a protective bone spur and you don&amp;#39;t want to remove a protective bone spur otherwise you&amp;#39;re going to hurt the patient um so we don&amp;#39;t want to do that to to patients um and let me go here and go back over here uh any other questions I can answer today uh put them up in the meantime I&amp;#39;m gonna switch the share for a second here um so again uh please like comment share subscribe um if you&amp;#39;re watching this for every one of you there&amp;#39;s 10 to 100 patients out there who probably need to hear this but they can&amp;#39;t find it so please go ahead and uh try to like comment share subscribe so more patients can find this information and then again as I said uh consider joining rpic or the Reddit sub on pic um or a patient only Q&amp;amp;A here on Facebook uh I got two more questions here Zach if the Bon spur damaged labor initially why would not red damage labor after repair it did not damage the laborum at all Zach uh that&amp;#39;s the that&amp;#39;s the issue I&amp;#39;m trying to explain to you that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s a fiction um so it is a fiction that the bone spur damaged laum in fact uh the newer research on this type of spur shows that the spur is there to protect the joint um it did not damage the laam in fact it Formed to protect the laam and the joint so taking it out makes no common sense um Stephen uh anything the future for insurance coverage and p uh which poos be would help me but deep down feels need a p sounds like you need a p um we have uh insurance coverage through 3500 employers for the pic on a couple different plans Samaritan Ministries is one in fact we got two patients coming in here soon that are getting covered by samarit Samaritan Ministries that&amp;#39;s a um that&amp;#39;s a a church-like Health Plan um there&amp;#39;s 3500 us companies that cover this everyone from John Deere um big tractor company to um Under Armour obviously everyone knows Under Armour um you know lots of large companies cover this um and we are taking it down one company at a time there&amp;#39;s not a not a week that goes by that our that our team isn&amp;#39;t out there trying to get more companies to cover uh this procedure and things like this um Lindsay sorry I&amp;#39;m late uh to watching does hyro dissection make the muscles more unstable it does not Lindsay uh that&amp;#39;s the good news about hyro dissection is that it&amp;#39;s about the most gentle thing you can do to try to open up an area for a nerve um whereas surgical decompression can damage the muscles Cheryl how long after picl should the patient start to feel Improvement or any uh treatment thank you Doctor well specific for pic we&amp;#39;re looking at the 2 to four month time frame usually on average about 3 months um for other types of treatments different time frames um uh casan do you use any other injectate than lysate for hydr dissection um we uh use both a third generation plet late as well as uh sometimes uh highdose platet rich plasma that&amp;#39;s luccy uh poor uh the more Lucy poor the better because any lucaites or white blood cells in the mix is going to cause inflammation inflammation around nerves equals a bad day for everybody um so uh those are the two things we tend to use um and then obviously if we&amp;#39;re down in Grand Cayman we can also use PL plet late with meesam stem cells added uh which can be very effective as well uh thank you Dr C me you Monday very about my case yeah I I&amp;#39;ll look at everything again Stephen um again just realize that you know for anyone I&amp;#39;ve done a tele medicine on who&amp;#39;s on here or who&amp;#39;s watching this after the fact just realize that I&amp;#39;m always happy to answer email questions um just random ones for for those patients um

place to get P other patients who are very experienced with this stuff to answer your questions uh happy to help Zach yeah at the end of the day the goal here is to try to teach patients and it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s awful to me that surgeons are still operating on pincor deformities because they shouldn&amp;#39;t be the only type of hip deformity uh that&amp;#39;s been shown to be very effective uh is actually a hip dysplasia where there&amp;#39;s a short socket but when it comes to pincer deformity it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s not an impingement it&amp;#39;s merely a bone spur that formed to protect the hip and you don&amp;#39;t want to remove it Andrea uh great I&amp;#39;m hoping I&amp;#39;m getting your name correct maybe I maybe I&amp;#39;m not I thought I remember it was pronounced more like Andrea Andrea Andrea okay guys well I think we&amp;#39;re running out of questions we&amp;#39;re coming up to the hour I want to thank you for um all the great questions again I I sincerely believe that patients learn through asking questions um this will be on Facebook it&amp;#39;ll be on YouTube under lives um and uh let&amp;#39;s see here casan uh do you get late with ultrasonic treatment or there other treatments other than the freeze thaw um I don&amp;#39;t know what you mean by that meaning that we use ultrasound imaging to perform nerve hyr dissections um and then freeze thaw I would not recommend at all that&amp;#39;s cryo that&amp;#39;s cryo treatment of a nerve so cry treatment of a nerve is to destroy the nerve we don&amp;#39;t want to destroy nerves if we don&amp;#39;t have to that&amp;#39;s why we use things like platelet late hyro dissection so that we can help the nerve and not destroy it um uh Lindsay looking look forward to starting P tomorrow on St Patrick&amp;#39;s Day yay I I don&amp;#39;t know if I&amp;#39;ve got anything green Lindsay I don&amp;#39;t certainly don&amp;#39;t have Green scrubs so uh I don&amp;#39;t know if I&amp;#39;ll be wearing something green or not but uh thank you for your confidence okay guys um I think you mean yes we use ultrasound guidance meaning ultrasound is used to guide the needle to the specific spot it needs to be that&amp;#39;s very different than ultrasound treatment in physical therapy where ultrasound treatment is to heat up tissues that&amp;#39;s a different kind of ultrasound that we use to actually see the nerve so that&amp;#39;s why it&amp;#39;s used okay guys thanks so much for watching have a great week I&amp;#39;ll be back next week with another interesting topic um and uh we&amp;#39;ll go from there thank you",

    "transcript": "good morning you guys it&amp;#39;s Karen and I wanted to come and review this the Halos cap this is called a Halos migraine relief cap um or cold cap is what I call it because it is one that you put in the freezer now I have tried many brands of these and this one is 20 um and they&amp;#39;re all around about the 2030 Mark but if you try a few and they&amp;#39;re no good you know it can add up to quite a lot of money so I thought it was worth me coming and reviewing this one um in case you were interested in getting one because I think this one is really good and I have tried a few others um that weren&amp;#39;t as good this one is £20 and it is a cool only one I think you can get some that you can put in the microwave and heat up but I have never found I have found heat to to help sometimes but if I need it I use a a wheat bag put it in the microwave and then just put it across my forehead that seems to be the best way for me um I&amp;#39;ve never tried one of these heated but as you will know if you suffer with migraines or even headaches most people will tell you that something ice cold is instant relief and this is instant relief and that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s the idea of it um so you keep it in the freezer but it is very very soft gel you can see that this is very very playable um you know you can fold it any which way I&amp;#39;ve actually bought two of these this is a repeat purchase because the first one it got so dirty I decided I would try and put it in the washing machine on a really low you know on a 30 silk wash or something like that and it just yeah it didn&amp;#39;t work it was it was unusable afterwards so I have bought another one um and the reason I was washing it is one of the things here I&amp;#39;m just going to give you my kind of tips and trips tricks but is that I&amp;#39;ve got makeup on it um I try on days that I&amp;#39;m not filming or D days that I&amp;#39;m not going out I try to actually not put makeup on my forehead but obviously a lot of the time I&amp;#39;ve got eyes Shadow on but I try to not put it on my forehead so that if I need to use this on my stepo makeup isn&amp;#39;t a problem but obviously as you can see sometimes it is another reason I tried to wash my Halos um cap is because the first time round I threw this away this is the packaging that it comes in and it&amp;#39;s a pouch with a zip top so you can just drop it in there um now I do leave mine open but last time like I said I threw this away and thought Oh what does it matter I&amp;#39;ll just stick this in the freezer but what happens is whatever is around it and for me I I I didn&amp;#39;t want to put this in like with um I was going to say food but garlic is food but I put this in the the drawer that has like garlic and Frozen Ginger and ice cream and things like that and um it&amp;#39;s stunk of garlic so it totally absorbs any smell from the drawer that it&amp;#39;s in if you don&amp;#39;t put it in the pouch when you&amp;#39;ve got a headache that&amp;#39;s really off you know you&amp;#39;ve got a headache and all you want is this nice ice cold thing you put it on and then all you can smell is garlic it kind of defeats the per purpose so I one my first tip for using this is make sure that you keep it in the bag and if you are unlike me I&amp;#39;m just too rushing about all the time but I don&amp;#39;t generally shut this and it&amp;#39;s all right but I would say I would recommend to shut it if you can just to save getting any kind of scent on this so far this hasn&amp;#39;t had any other scent on it no I can&amp;#39;t smell anything it&amp;#39;s just so much relief when I put it on and I&amp;#39;ve had this nail for another three or four months I had the other one for the same amount of time it only comes in two colors it only comes in this color and gray I wish it came in Black I don&amp;#39;t know why I feel like CU I answered the door this morning to the dog walker wearing this and I feel like if it was black it wouldn&amp;#39;t look so crazy which is weird because you know it doesn&amp;#39;t look hip and trendy or anything I don&amp;#39;t know um but yeah I wish it came with in black and I think that&amp;#39;s another reason why I tried different brands in between repurchasing this one you know between the first time and this time purchasing this one um what was the problem with the other ones the other ones didn&amp;#39;t get as cold the other ones didn&amp;#39;t feel as comfortable on my head they were kind of one of them was just too heavy that as soon as you put it on it slipped down over my face now I don&amp;#39;t always want this over my eyes I sometimes just want it here because it&amp;#39;s enough um it&amp;#39;s enough relief that I can walk around and do things and so I didn&amp;#39;t necessarily want it over my eyes but one of the other ones I got would just like fall down and it was really hard to keep up like I said some of them don&amp;#39;t get cold enough um one of the ones I got looked like it was in sort of three pieces and and it actually had very very hard ice packs in it so that would get a lot cooler but it wasn&amp;#39;t at all comfortable to wear at all comfortable um so that&amp;#39;s why I prefer this Halos one this is not a sponsored video by the way and I&amp;#39;ve not been sent this or anything I bought this both times all the times I bought these out of my own money this stays cold for about 15 to 20 minutes for me um which is enough to sometimes eliminate a headache for me and remember I have migrain so there&amp;#39;s all sorts of symptoms this is the headache pain I use this for and that&amp;#39;s what it works on but I would say for about the first 2 or 3 minutes it&amp;#39;s almost too cold I can&amp;#39;t have it completely on my forehead like I&amp;#39;ll put it on my forehead and it is like instant relief but I&amp;#39;ll sort of lift it up so that it&amp;#39;s on top of my hair so there&amp;#39;s a little bit of a layer between my hair and my head I do that for the first couple of minutes um and then I pull it down and just leave it on for probably about 10 minutes and it&amp;#39;s so nice really really nice it doesn&amp;#39;t get get rid of my headache every single time a lot of the time it does um but if it doesn&amp;#39;t get rid of it it has lessened it and like I said it&amp;#39;s immediate relief this is one of those immediate relief things so my tips for this were don&amp;#39;t put NE garlic or make sure you put into its pouch um remove makeup if you you know if it&amp;#39;s easy enough to remove your makeup and you&amp;#39;re not going anywhere I would do so so that you don&amp;#39;t end up like this cuz this I mean it could be a lot worse that&amp;#39;s actually not too bad considering um I use this a lot um I I would say it takes a good couple of hours to get cold enough to use again so I have on occasion used it twice a day but not very often um and sometimes I&amp;#39;ll for I&amp;#39;ll just take the take output on the side of my hospital and be like you want me to put that back in the freezer you know um and the other tip oh yeah the other tip is to fold it in half I think I&amp;#39;ve got a video to show you of this when it the corness feels like it&amp;#39;s run out there&amp;#39;s actually still some corness left in the upper part I don&amp;#39;t know why I don&amp;#39;t know it&amp;#39;s just cuz it&amp;#39;s not touching your head and so if you fold it in half like that and pull it down you actually it suddenly feels cooler again I suppose it&amp;#39;s almost like you know when you&amp;#39;re moving your feet around in bed to try and find the cool patch it&amp;#39;s kind of like that so if you fold it in half and then pull it down a bit it&amp;#39;s cold again and you can get some more relief from it um so yeah that&amp;#39;s everything the the one other thing I wanted to talk about which is nothing to do with this but is that there is now a neck version of this I&amp;#39;ll show you this one is by only care and it is one that you oh it&amp;#39;s Vel very very strong velcro which is a good thing I&amp;#39;ve only had this about a week my my big old earrings are going to get in the way I think um so you can put it on just like that or you can put it on right the way around um and I would recommend this so far but obviously I haven&amp;#39;t been using it for very long I&amp;#39;ve used it a couple of times I don&amp;#39;t really like cold on my neck I&amp;#39;ve always found that too much but this I can bear easily so I just thought I&amp;#39;d mention that in case you have neck pain give that one a try cuz I also have neck pain so I hope that that was useful let me know if you have ever tried this cap or if you use any other kind of cool cap um that has been good for you and I speak to you again soon",

    "transcript": "good morning friends it is Thursday and I did not sleep well [Music] again so we were supposed to go on a field trip this morning um and I had to be up by 9:45 to get the kids up and get ready which is um not super early by any means but I wanted to make sure that we were ready to go and we crawled into bed will and I went to bed last night like 10:30 so I was like I&amp;#39;ll get a great night&amp;#39;s sleep wake up feeling refreshed I tossed and turned again this is night three of horrible sleep for one reason or reason or another and then to tap it off I woke up at 6 a. with a migraine hormonal migraine so moved out to the couch see if I could sleep better out here cuz I was still tossing and turning and hoping that better sleep position would allow the headache to go away cuz sometimes I just need to sleep it off so I slept for till about 9: and woke up on the couch and I did sleep better on the couch but my head was still throbbing and I was feeling sick to my stomach so I got up I texted will that what was going on just letting him know that in case I slept in later that&amp;#39;s why and then texted my friend Lauren who was running the field trip we were supposed to go see a production like a play um told her we weren&amp;#39;t going to make it told her what was going on took my meds laid back down um I at that point I moved to the bedroom cuz it was darker in the bedroom than it was in the living room at that point because the sun was up so laid back down around 9:00 with meds and one of my meds makes me drowsy actually two of them make me drowsy um I take toor doll with a mixture of toor doll for the pain feneran for the nausea and flex ril just to relax the muscles it&amp;#39;s a muscle relaxer so the feneran and the flexer both make me drowsy not many things make me drowsy but those two do so took that concoction went laid back down finally passed back out around 9:30 9:45 and slept until noon so I did get a few hours of sleep but I&amp;#39;m super groggy still from my meds and my head is still hurting a little bit but it did take away most of the pain so it&amp;#39;s noon and we&amp;#39;ve barely started our day the kids are up but we haven&amp;#39;t done any school and we have groceries coming in like an hour so I have to be I have to I don&amp;#39;t have to be so I have to record that grocery haul video which goes up before you see this video and just try to attempt school but staring at a screen is no fun when you have a migraine I was going to just lay down on the couch until groceries got here and just kind of Zone in and out not necessarily sleep but it hurts to hold my head up so it&amp;#39;s like two migraines I&amp;#39;ve had in the past month I think I had one not too long ago that canceled plans also which is a bummer but I can&amp;#39;t predict when they&amp;#39;re going to happen and they&amp;#39;ve been happening more often I get them weather related and hormonal related so usually at least once a month um if not long more so that&amp;#39;s fun all right so it is about what time is it just about 2:00 and we are finished with our group studies for school made our way through all of that got interrupted when the groceries were delivered but we got that taken care of and I got that recorded and I need to edit that and get that up the kids just have their independent work left so handwriting and math each of them so they will be working on that momentarily and I see a nap in my future because my meds left me so down groggy that I am like struggling to stay awake so school was a process um I just don&amp;#39;t think I&amp;#39;m going to make it through the day without a nap unfortunately just because those meds make me sleepy but will should be home from work soon I would guess I&amp;#39;m GNA touch base with him in just a minute um the kids just had some lunch Alice had pancakes frozen pancakes and Jackson had a bagel with cream cheese that&amp;#39;s all they wanted and now you&amp;#39;re all caught up I think I&amp;#39;m going to make something I had an Atkins bar um for breakfast and I might make some peanut butter toast for lunch it&amp;#39;s like just one of my go-tos when I need something quick and easy with high fiber high protein um that better Goods bread is so good for that I get that at Walmart and it&amp;#39;s low carb super high fiber so I might make some peanut butter toast or just a sandwich something cuz we just had the groceries delivered so we have lunch meat on hand now where we didn&amp;#39;t have any of the last few days Jackson has been obsessed with toasted sandwiches recently so we went through the lunch me a lot faster cuz he was eating like two and three of them a day only had like one day I think had like you had two yeah he was you were definitely going through them we went through that lunch meet pretty quick so that&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s happening here it looks a little overcast outside but it&amp;#39;s supposed to be nice like a high of 70 today so not as nice as the recent few days but we are getting thunderstorms potentially at some point during the day and then rain again this weekend Friday should be nice so again today&amp;#39;s Thursday so tomorrow is supposed to be nice we might do a bonfire tomorrow night depending on the weather and how we are feeling but I&amp;#39;m just glad my headache is is mostly gone even if it does leave me feeling ready for some z&amp;#39;s hey friends coming at you from the recliner again I did take a nap in the other recliner I like napping on the couch I don&amp;#39;t nap as well in the love SE as I do on the couch it&amp;#39;s weird the lumbar support is slightly different um so I sleep better on the couch in that recliner but I did nap and I as I was falling asleep I was like if I can just get a real good nap in I can tackle the rest of this day and I do feel better so there&amp;#39;s that but I do not feel like I can tackle the world like I had hoped um so that is that will is playing some fortnite Jackson is playing games in his room Alice texted me and asked if I could make her mashed potatoes but I&amp;#39;m not making her mashed potatoes she can have something else um mashed potatoes are on the menu meal plan for next week so she got the idea in her head that she could just have mashed potatoes whenever I make them in the instant pot so it&amp;#39;s like hard but I just don&amp;#39;t feel like making mashed potatoes right now I might make alfredo tortillini tonight uh I got cheese tortillini from Walmart just the Frozen family size bag stuff two of the family siiz bags cuz my family loves pasta so they will eat it and I don&amp;#39;t think one bag is really a family size I feel like it would be good for a side dish but not for like the main portion of a meal I think will could probably eat a family-sized bag on his own um not even even exaggerating so I might make that with some broccoli and garlic toast tonight um and then we can have the leftover chili for lunch tomorrow weighing all the pros and cons in my head because I&amp;#39;m feeling I&amp;#39;m having like hot flashes right now I&amp;#39;m just still feeling funky um I&amp;#39;m probably going to go check my temperature cuz I could be coming down with something with the way this week has gone started with a flare up on Monday of my autoimmune junk and carried into Tuesday and then had migraine today so I&amp;#39;m just it&amp;#39;s not been a good week friends it&amp;#39;s just not so I&amp;#39;m going to go check my temperature and drink some water and try to get some motivation to do something productive so I&amp;#39;ve got two bags of the cheese torini um water in a pot bringing that to a boil so I can cook the pasta and then a jar of beri alfredo sauce so that&amp;#39;ll all get mixed together I&amp;#39;ve got broccoli in the microwave and garlic bread ready to go in the oven once that preheat so I cut the broccoli up real small and mixed it in with the pasta so it&amp;#39;s pasta Alfredo broccoli concoction [Music] new scenery I have been sitting out listening to an audio book on the back porch for

resolve your headache right now today all right so just sit tight for one moment as I get some of his consultation papers all right all right now what we have here is a series of somewhat unconventional questions questions that are going to help you to relieve that pressure in your head okay they&amp;#39;re going to help you to relieve the pressure in your head and according to Jojo

tension slowly but surely so we&amp;#39;ll go through them together they&amp;#39;re going to be somewhat repetitive but that&amp;#39;s okay you you simply need to answer all of them in a somewhat focused state of mind either allowed or in your head it doesn&amp;#39;t matter as long as you focus on the questions that are being asked all right so let&amp;#39;s try this where is your headache

    "transcript": "my name is Dr wisdom and welcome to another episode of headaches and neuro headaches of neuro ofic origin so today is a part three of several parts we have um begun to teach on part one part two and today is part three I hope it&amp;#39;s going to be exciting I hope it&amp;#39;s going to be funfilled and I hope you will be able to learn one or two from this brief session of mine please do well to subscribe like comment and share this channel as do so God bless you in Jesus name so quickly we have been looking at headaches we have been trying to trace um the pathway of headache most times patients come to the clinic and most of their complaints are headache and it is it is essential and expedient that every practitioner understands this um concept and knows how to go about it so in our last class we talking about important Clues to note um in the course of headp we talk about the frequency we talked about the location duration of onset that the location of the headache it plays an important role in telling you the type of headache we are dealing with we also talked about the intensity of pain how intense the pain is is a pointer and a clue on what we are dealing with we also looked at the usual cost the triggering factors and then the family history so this was all we were able to look out for in our last class that was um two weeks ago so today we want to look at another important aspect of headache and then want to make progress today we are looking at migraine headache we want to understand what it is want to know what it is want to know what causes it and want to know how to be able to identify migraine headache and finally we want to also look at the treatment um plan in migrain headache so it&amp;#39;s going to be all these and a whole lot more sit tight grab a cup of coffee or a cup of tea or whatever it is you are drinking and then enjoy the show so quickly what is migraine want to understand what um migraine is all about so migraine is um is a type of headache that is the most common in I of all the types of headache we going to be looking at migraine is the most common and it is most times um the most how will I put it now not just the most common but the it is a tricky one that needs special attention to be able to diagnose and then able to treat effectively so um quickly the international Headache Society has um given us a guideline or a criteria for diagnosing migraine because there is migraine with aura and then there is migraine without Aura so the international Headache Society they they they&amp;#39;ve come together these ass of wise men they&amp;#39;ve come together and then they&amp;#39;ve put up a criteria to be able to classify migraine into Aura and without Aura so let me just give you a rundown before we begin the teaching for today um they have classified that headache for that is for um the classification of migraine without aura is that headaches lasting for 4 to 72 hours um lasting for 4 to 72 hours whether it was treated successfully or not is one of the criteria for um classifying headache without migraine second the second classification is headache that has any two of the following characteristics one iseral location the two is posting quality the three is moderate or severe intensity the thought is aggravation by walking stairs or similar routine physical activity so any two from these four I have listed is um one of the criterias for classifying migraine without Aura are we together and again another classification is during headaches at least one of the following should happen nausea or vomiting photophobia or phonophobia so one of these should happen for it to be called a migraine without Aura another classification is not attributed to any disorder in other words there&amp;#39;s no underlining disorder we are looking at so this is one of this this is the classification of migraine without headache and also there&amp;#39;s a classification or a criteria for classification of headache with aura and this is one of the this is the table for it um Aura consisting of atast least one of the following but no Moto weakness the first is fully reversible visual symptoms including positive features EG flickering of Lights spots or line and or negative features that is loss of vision I&amp;#39;m going to explain all this when I begin to teach and again secondly is fully reversible sensory symptoms including positive features that is pains and needles and or negative featur that is numbness and the third is fully reversible dysphasic speech disturbance the second table for classification is at least two of the following the first is homonomous visual symptoms and or unilateral sensory symptoms the second is at least one Ora symptoms developing gradually over more than 25 minutes and or different oral symptoms occurring in sucession over more than or equal to 5 minutes and then each symptom lasts for about more than or equal to 5 minutes and less than or equal to 60 Minutes also headaches fulfilling the criteria B and criteria D for migraine without Aura begins during the aura of follows order within 60 minutes so and again it should not be Associated to another Disorder so this is a quick one on how the international Headache Society has graded or classified headache into aura and headache without Aura but today let me begin to explain what I just read to you so that it begin to make more sense and you can be able to appreciate migraine headache so migraine is a disease that causes headache the most it is the disease that causes headache the most migraine headache and also it is more prominent in women women are more uh the major sufferers of migraine and it in fact from research it shows that it happened more than twice in women than in men so most times you see issues of migraine women usually suffer it most because like I said in the previous classes that um menstrual um cramps menstral menstration is one of the triggers to migraine so it is usually found more in women than in men and also it is highest among 30 to 50 year old you see those who are within the Rage of 30 to 50 are more um like likely to suffer from migraine so the the sometimes age is dependent of how often you suffer from migraine and also it is more in the wh than in the black so the Whit have more Tendencies to suffer from migraine and then patients with migraine have a higher risk of having stroke especially those with aura so patients who have and migraine with aura whereby it affects their visual symson they have a higher risk of of um eventually going into stroke so this is why every time you have migraine headache every time you experience this kind of headaches it is good and important to you rush down to the clinic or to the hospital for proper evaluation and then proper treatment because if left untreated the more it happens the more it um progresses you are likely um you have a higher tendency of um suffering from stroke so this is not to scare you but this is to make you become more responsible with your health so and in migraine like I said earlier Aura may be present or Aura may be absent so what do we mean um by this Aura per se so Aura is a set of neurogical symptoms they are usually visual is a set of neurogical symptoms which are usually visual sensory or speech related that accompanies migraine so Aura is sensory related it is auditory related or speech related in a sense that your vision is distorted your hearing is distorted or your ability to speak is distorted this what we mean by Aura and then it is usually accompanied by us accompan it in migraine so um Aura may be present in migraine it can be absent and again I want you to note that migraine is usually unilateral that it is one side it can be this way it can be one side but there are rare occasions where it is bilateral but it can also be bilateral anyway but most times people who suffer it they tend to say that it is unilateral and then it spreads gradually from one point to another it spreads gradually and also it is front to temporal so that mean it is here the front to this place or from the front here to this place and posting in nature in the sense that as if it is trying to um blow a closed door so it is posting on the door what you mean by pating in nature and again activity um increases or exacerbates the condition people who have migraine have reported that if assuming they in the work they&amp;#39;re in a workplace and then they came down with migraine it it seems as though the more they were involved in activity the migraine increased so activities such as sexual performance can increase the intensity and the efficacy of migraine so this this is why we advise that every time you have migraine headache please take a rest and make sure you are relaxed so that it takes its natural cause and then it goes away but if you are going to experience migraine and then you are also working at the same time you are just aggravating the condition also um sensory stimuli a trigger so um sensory stimuli are trigger to migraine what do we mean by the sensory stimuli in the sense that two Bright Lights can Trier migraine too loud noise can trigger migraine certain smells can trigger migraine for some people if they&amp;#39;re exposed to too bright light after a while it leads to migraine so that is a a trigger for some people when they are in a very loud environment like people who Club a lot they usually have symptoms of migraine because they&amp;#39;re exposed to too loud sound coming into their um into their e drums and then it triggers migraine and some people again certain smells like certain chemicals certain um plants can induce migraine headache so um stimuli are triggers um to migrain and again due to the um triggers from these sensy stream and patients usually are forced to find refuge in solitary places like if it is triggered by light and you find out that such patients they want to go to a dark room to stay if it is triggered by sound such patients want to go to to a a a quiet place so it gives them a s of of Solace it gives them a sense of Tranquility because they are now um removed from this from what is triggering it so um um patients who usually um have migraine want to you see that they want to stay in excluded places they want to stay in quiet places they want to stay in Dark Places and they want to stay in ventilated places where there are no unusual smells are we together and again it can be accompanied with autonomic phenomenon what we mean by autonomic phenomenon are there are conditions which you cannot control EG vomiting you cannot you cannot just say you want to vomit so they are they are um called autonomic phenomenon so you can&amp;#39;t control how and when they happen so migraine is usually accompanied with autonomic phenomenon such as vomiting so you find out that in a patient who has migraine they tell you that they were vomiting severally so it&amp;#39;s also an indicator to lead you that what the kind of headache they having is a migraine headache also nausea can is one of the autonomic um um um symptoms we see in migraine so triggers can be easily spotted unlike other types of headache where you are not sure what is triggering it but for migraine headache the patients can easily trigger what spoted it what um Can it spot what triggered it so for instance they can tell you that oh it happened immediately I went to the market so you know that activity induced it so they can tell oh it happened after I had Marathon sex or it happened after I was exposed to too bright a light too bright light for some time or it happened after I was exposed to very loud noise for a certain period of time so the triggers can be easily spotted and that is the good thing about Myra but yet it is still a Del in clinic but with this few points I&amp;#39;ve been able to bring out over time you&amp;#39;ll be able to see that the trigger are not far from within you the triggers are not far from within you and you can easily spot them out so pain usually last for about 4 to 72 hours the pain of migraine usually last for about 4 to 72 hours that about 4 hours to days so it&amp;#39;s not an easy one per se and it is a terrible pain so you find out that patients that in pain for 4 3 5 6 even up to days so this is one of the um the issues seen in migraine and it&amp;#39;s usually relieved the following day after a prolonged sleep because during sleeping you are in a state of inactivity so inactivity helps to quiet down the progression of migraine so you find out that most patients once they go to sleep and then they wake up they they tend to have relief they tend to have relief in of the migraine headache so attacks of more than a day are usually uncommon in migraine so you see attacks of today tomorrow they usually uncommon they are possible but they are rare in migraine and episodic attacks May develop into chronic migraine which is marked with 15 or more headaches in a month so what I trying to say that um if the migraine keeps happening and is keep happening and maybe the patient is not treating it or he&amp;#39;s just taking paracetamol or just taking um self-medicate it can now it can now progress into what we call chronic migraine and in chronic migraine we are having about 15 or more migraines in a month and which means you are from statistics it is as though that every 2 days you are down with migraine and this this disrupt your your social life disrupt your economic life disrupt everything about you so it&amp;#39;s not what we want to um you want to wish for an enemy so um is that is why it&amp;#39;s important that every time you have migraine you make sure your heal practitioner is aware and then effective measures are taken because if it keeps happen like that it can proceed to what we call chronic migraine character characterized by 15 or more headaches in a month and migraine with aura was previously known as ofic or classic migraine so that was um the previous um name we call migraine with aura and then currently um Aura symptoms usually occur in about 25% of patients and I&amp;#39;ve said earlier that aura are neurological symptoms usually visual sensory or speech related so there are symptoms affecting your um your ability to speak so you see someone having a SL speech affecting your vision you are seeing what is not there or you are seeing what is there already so something affecting your speech or it could be um it could be smell it could be um smell related so um that is it for oral symptoms which occurs in about 25% of patients so Aura there are two classifications of Aura of um migraine with aura there is the migraine there is the positive and then the negative Aura there is the positive aura and negative Aura so in positive aura you are seeing something that is not really there so in positive aura the patient in SE an imaginary thing just like a mirage while driving and then you you see it seems as though there is water in front but there is no water so that is what um positive Ura means the patient is seeing something that is not really there so for instance this patient is seeing bright flashes of light during the migraine or the patient is having blurry vision it seems as though the whole world has gone blurry or the patient is having scintillations so it&amp;#39;s seen um as though a part of a segment has been cut out or the patient is experiencing what we call heat waves so you find out that the patient is telling that it seems as though um smoke is rising out from from pain so the in AA with migraine the patient is seeing what is not there that is for the positive Ur the patient is seeing what is not there and that is normal so he comes down with the symptoms of um see bright ISU of light blurry vision culation heat waves and so on and so forth and then the negative um in the negative Aura the patient is seeing parts that are missing so he&amp;#39;s actually seeing something but it&amp;#39;s not complete that is what negative Aura is all about so in positive aura he is seeing what is not there so what a noral patient is seeing is he is seeing a wall that is white but that but in a positive M Aura the patient is seeing the wall but then he&amp;#39;s seeing other things that are not in the wall but in negative Aura the patient is seeing parts that are missing so he seeing a wall and it&amp;#39;s as if some part of the wall is chopped off so one of the symptoms we can see is that there&amp;#39;s a transcent vision loss so the patient can&amp;#39;t see for some time and then you see area of blind spot it&amp;#39;s as though the whole place is is covered in darkness and again there are symptoms of tunel vision which is a a seen in advanced glaucoma so you see a case of Tel Vision whereby the patient is like oh I&amp;#39;m having serious headache but then I can&amp;#39;t see things happening peripherally so it just seem straight ahead but you can&amp;#39;t see things happening in in his or periphery and also a loss in color vision so you find out that brown things colors appear faded or they appear in black and white so this is what we call the negative Aura so in the positive aura the patient is seeing a thing but then what he&amp;#39;s seeing is not really there but in negative Aura he is seeing something that has been cut out that is there but it is not complete characterized by Tel Vision um um blind spots lots of color vision so migraine without Aura was previously known as simple migraine or hemia so when I&amp;#39;m done with this class with the whole session the series will be is going to be a long series because um headache and Associated symptoms is a large and Broad concept I will then be publishing the slides which I have prepared and then you&amp;#39;ll be able to see and appreciate the pictures of these things I&amp;#39;m talking about so that it will give you a proper mental um view of what I&amp;#39;m talking about so in my slide here I have a picture of CES Cota I have a the picture of tunel vision seen in migraine and then so all this will be in the slide when we are done with the series or probably after this miniseries I will then do a complete video maybe on Zoom or um gole meet where it will just be the whole video in one so that it can also give us the opportunity to ask questions and also give us opportunity to see the pictures and then appreciate the lecture um in in a better sense so there are unusual forms of migraine I&amp;#39;m just going to introduce them today and um to in our next class I&amp;#39;ll be dwelling I&amp;#39;ll be giving an in-depth analysis to each and every one of them so I&amp;#39;m just going to introduce them this evening and then in our next class I&amp;#39;ll pick out one and then we&amp;#39;ll discuss it and then break it down so that we will be able to understand these things I&amp;#39;m taking the class bit by bit so that it won&amp;#39;t be so much on us and then we can be able to digest and understand what I&amp;#39;m teaching so there are several kind of unusual forms of migraine in a sense that they are not common they are not um they not as common as the aura and without or micine but they are still there and it&amp;#39;s important that we look at them it&amp;#39;s important that we discuss them and it&amp;#39;s important that we understand the pathopysiology of them so the first is vasilla AR Migraine with symptoms such as diplopia fertigo totinos parestesia in the face AIA all those so there is another form of basilia AR migraine another form of an unusual kind of migraine is offtopic migraine ofic migraine is like the ofia which means paralysis of a muscle it is usually accompanied with tosis and diplopia so when you see tosis and diopa likely there is an induced tosis with double vision likely what we are looking at is ofic migraine and then there&amp;#39;s also retina migraine in retina migraine it is one just in one eye and not in the other eye we are going to look at all these also there is what we call complicated migraine there is also benign episodic migraine and there&amp;#39;s also hemiplegic migraine migrainous vertigo and then migraine in women so you see women who are um who are in pregnancy or who are menstruated a special kind of migraine they have and we&amp;#39;re going to look at all this in the next class so I want to thank you for joining us it&amp;#39;s a brief class so let me do a quick um summary of what I have thought today I have Tau you on the that migraine headache is more in women that in men and then is the most common type of headache and it&amp;#39;s more in the whites than in the blacks and patients with migraine have a higher RIS of running to stroke and then um I have also said that it is highest among 30 to 50 years year old and a for differentiated Aura from non Ora and I said that aura Aura are um uh uh neurological symptoms which can be visual sensory or speech related and then I I&amp;#39;ve said that migraine the triggers of migraine can be easily sported an activity aggravates the um the the the the progression of migraine and then I also say that sensory stimuli are the triggers of are the common triggers of migrain and also pain last for about 4 to 72 hours and they relieved after sleeping and I say that um the episodic attacks can lead to my um chronic attacks which is characterized by 15 or more headaches in a month and I&amp;#39;ve also said that aura can also occur in 25% of of patients and I&amp;#39;ve also thought on the positive aura and negative Aura in the positive you are seeing what is not there in the negative you are seeing it but a part of it is cut out and then um all this uh is just what I&amp;#39;ve discussed so in our next class we are going to be look looking at the um uncommon forms of migraine and then we&amp;#39;re going to doing an in-depth analysis thank you so much for joining us my name is Dr wisdom so do well to subscribe do well to like do well to comment and do well to drop your questions on the inbox I&amp;#39;ll find out time to reply all of them and I&amp;#39;ll make sure we going to make progress so I hope to see you in our class

    "transcript": "avoiding triggers is keeping you stuck in the migraine cycle here&amp;#39;s why so I was recently working with a girl in her mid 20s she had been battling migraines for 10 years and this point she was getting anywhere from two to four a week so very chronic major problem problem in her life and how how she dealt with them was number one she take medications to get through the attacks or try to avoid the attacks and then number two she would avoid triggers she would avoid um she thought caffeine was a trigger so she would avoid that she&amp;#39; avoid going outside she thought going out to the weather would make it worse but the the thing she was not aware of was her her nervous system was overactive and this is the reason little things like weather change or caffeine or eating chocolate whatever it is put her over the edge so her ultimate goal was to get back to well get migraine relief but she also wanted to get back to running she wanted to get back to working out she she was also avoiding those so what I had to teach her was was was constant nervous set resets throughout the day and what we started with was a simple breathing exercise so just inhaling for four holding that the top for three and exhaling for seven so do that with me real quick inhale for four hold to the top for three and then exhale for seven and doing this throughout the day will reset your nervous system you can&amp;#39;t just do it once or twice and think your nervous system&amp;#39;s good got to do it throughout the day and do this prior to any any activity that&amp;#39;ll put your nervous system in the in the right State I hope this helps",

    "transcript": "good morning from the heart of New York City this is Food School Smarter Stronger Leaner podcast podcast dedicated to one thing to learn and apply to eat better daily i&amp;#39;m your host Angela Shireina from Create Yourself today your personal nutritionist your personal health and wellness coach your personal fat loss guru and just someone with a lot a lot of passion for healthy eating healthy food what you put on your plate to feel better look better and perform better on all levels hopefully not the other way around today guys we are talking about very important subject very uh underestimated and not talked enough about I believe uh subject in nutrition in healthy eating and that is electrolytes and specifically electrolyte uh magnesium um basically electrolytes are the minerals that help our cells to function properly sending signals to each other our nerve cells or any kind of cells and electrolytes are basically mineral salts that involved in many many reactions in our body that helps to maintain normal blood pressure again that helps to uh maintain proper communication between between cells and even though proper communication between cells sounds abstract but without it you cannot survive as a multi-cellular organism and you&amp;#39;re going to feel really shitty if your electrolyte balance is out of balance uh a lot of people on western diet people who eat poorly uh poor diet people who eat a lot of processed food not enough uh leafy greens uh also people on low carbohydrate diet who do not consume uh a lot of vegetables or plant foods that contain most of the uh for example in particular we&amp;#39;re going to talk about magnesium uh are in are deficient in magnesium And um magnesium guys it&amp;#39;s involved in more than 600 reactions in our body including energy creation everybody needs energy right when you think you&amp;#39;re low on energy and you need your cup of coffee to boost your performance you just might be good with some magnesium and coffee will not solve the problem uh in the long run protein formation helps create new proteins from amino acids building muscles guys if you don&amp;#39;t have enough magnesium you and you&amp;#39;re eating all the protein all the amino acids you still might not build any muscle because you lack magnesium gene maintenance helps create and repair DNA and RNA and without DNA repair guys none of our cells will be healthy and we will not be healthy overall as an organism muscle movements um magnesium is a part of contraction and relaxation of muscles so if you&amp;#39;re having cramps all the time probably electrolyte imbalance is the re is the reason and it can be potassium it can be magnesium most of the time but there are other electrolytes um like calcium for example or um other minerals are electrolytes too but in smaller amounts and usually people are getting them or uh don&amp;#39;t have that adverse effects that you would have when you don&amp;#39;t get enough potassium or magnesium especially magnesium that we are talking about today then magnesium is also involved in nervous system regulation helps regulate neurotransmitters which send messages throughout your brain and nervous system bottom line guys magnesium is electrolyte is a mineral that supports hundreds and hundreds of chemical reactions in our body and a lot of people these days especially people on a western diet people not eating enough of um next let me actually read you uh a list or um name a few foods that are really rich in magnesium so pumpkin seeds for example 46% per a/4 of cup or 16 g spinach boiled 39% of the uh normal amount that is sorry of the normal amount that is uh regulated by um so spinach you get 39% of your daily need in 180 80 g Swiss chart uh 38% in 180 g dark chocolate with 70 805% uh cocoa solids 33% uh black beans uh black beans 30% also a few other foods quinoa haliboot almonds cashews macarel avocado salmon Um those foods that have magnesium and especially leafy greens like spinach like Swiss chard I would definitely recommend to add to your diets almonds also but they&amp;#39;re not as high per 24 g basically a little bit less than an ounce they have 25% um but yeah if you eat 100 g of almonds your need in magnesium will be satisfied um anyway guys if you&amp;#39;re not getting enough magnesium you uh might experience problems with your cell uh DNA repair with your protein formation with energy creation um also magnesium uh can help you to boost your exercise performance uh it can help to fight depression and actually the lack of magnesium can cause depression uh it can um help you to regulate your blood sugar and lower your blood pressure uh it has anti-inflammatory benefits uh magnesium can help prevent migraines and again the deficiency of it can actually cause migraines uh it can reduce your insulin resistance and help with insulin resistance it can helps with uh if if you&amp;#39;re a girl it can helps with PM PMS symptoms uh also magnesium it can help u with constipation with sleep quality and in fact the lack of magnesium uh can really affect the your sleep and for example if you want to take magnesium uh for sleep then 500 mgram of magnesium taken daily can help you to improve the quality of your sleep if you&amp;#39;re having troubles falling asleep um and of course again muscle regulation depression uh a lot of people you know ask me like I&amp;#39;m having or talk to me and tell me I&amp;#39;m having cramps or I have trouble sleeping or uh my energy you I have problems you I always feel fatigue i always feel tired and I tell them are you taking multivitamin or electrolytes something uh that has minerals like magnesium like potassium like uh calcium like iron you know are you taking uh electrolyte or multivitamin and people kind of brush it off and think it&amp;#39;s not important and I&amp;#39;m joking and uh their body does not require anti any multivitamin or electrolyte uh and then they continue having the same symptoms and I&amp;#39;m like why don&amp;#39;t you try why why why why i mean like you&amp;#39;re having troubles and obviously something in your body is not working and uh you got to do something to make it to make it better it&amp;#39;s not going to go away uh and and a lot of people just wouldn&amp;#39;t do anything and I&amp;#39;m just always so like I don&amp;#39;t know i&amp;#39;m blown away by the fact that people wouldn&amp;#39;t do such a simple thing as taking electrolyte once a day just because they don&amp;#39;t understand and you might not understand your biochemistry and that there are certain minerals uh certain vitamins uh that and nutrients that your body needs to perform optimally in if you don&amp;#39;t get it you&amp;#39;re just not going to feel well either your energy going to be out of bounds you will you will have trouble sleeping you will have uh troubles exercising you will have cramps you can have irregular heartbeat or problems with your blood pressure and blood sugar so guys for example my morning routine includes drinking half a liter of water with a magnesium supplement that I&amp;#39;m going to that I love uh it&amp;#39;s called electrolyte stamina by T minerals i&amp;#39;m going to link it in the show notes also I&amp;#39;m going to put a link in the show notes to uh some more information about uh magnesium that we are talking about today and also the um special dosages of magnesium for reducing muscle cramps or dosage for depression or uh to improve sleep or enhance exercise performance uh or to decrease migraine symptoms and if you&amp;#39;re having troubles with bowel movements uh uh particularly constipation magnesium also can help so electrolytes guys and especially guys that especially for you on low carbohydrate diet that I&amp;#39;m on on ketogenic diet on uh carnivor diet any kind of diet that you reduce the amount of plant foods where you can find the most magnesium right now I&amp;#39;m eating zero uh plant food so if you&amp;#39;re on any kind of low carbohydrate diet you absolutely need to supplement with electrolytes and specifically and especially with magnesium if you don&amp;#39;t you&amp;#39;re just not going to survive on this diet you&amp;#39;re going to feel like and I&amp;#39;m very sorry for you already if you decide to go on a like low carbohydrate diet on keto diet uh and you decide to not take electrolytes that&amp;#39;s going to be a real challenge and you&amp;#39;re going to feel shitty and you&amp;#39;re not going to be able to continue so electrolytes guys uh check out the show notes for the link uh start taking electrolytes and you&amp;#39;d be surprised how much better you&amp;#39;re going to feel like right away first day you take an electrolytes your performance your energy uh the clarity of your thinking your uh negative thinking will uh improve dramatically so

today if you need to create a healthy meal plan that ensures that you&amp;#39;re getting all the essential vitamins and minerals that need to be in your diet so you feel good perform amazing mentally and physically and of course look good too uh because the lack of certain minerals and electrolytes can cause uh you know cravings hunger and weight gain and uh blood sugar imbalances blood pressure

raggedy dumb dirty troll that&amp;#39;s trying to make a mockery out of a competition where there was no illegal activity all you can do is sit back puff on your pipe and laugh okay now not a crack pipe a tobacco let me be clear we&amp;#39;re not talking about a crack pipe we&amp;#39;re talking about a tobacco pipe okay all you got to do is sit back and take a puff out off of your tobacco pipe and laugh when a Dusty troll who can never run a actual competition that means that the people are getting their fair share of the winnings you know see y&amp;#39;all never have competitions where you guys are able to see the cash apps what&amp;#39;s Good Under New Management what&amp;#39;s good Daria what is good sweetie okay I think I got everybody so you guys are not used to competitions where you&amp;#39;re able to see where the money is going where your money is going more importantly not even just random money your money you guys are not used to being able to see how it&amp;#39;s being distributed like things like this is not typical because we have a lot of Dusty [ __ ] that want to run scams on y&amp;#39;all now what can a [ __ ] like like you see my thing about these hoes is anytime it&amp;#39;s something good that&amp;#39;s not involving them it&amp;#39;s a problem right if you want to take at a look at the Last of the Mohicans of the beef sector these Dusty [ __ ] are grasping at straws and we all see it we all see it even Jay Wilson is so pathetic he has now become a curing panelist Jay Wilson has demoted himself to where he is clicking links and hollering fussing and screaming because he needs attention Jay Wilson You Are [ __ ] pathetic [ __ ] from Treasure Lane sunning you to you becoming a cussing panelist [ __ ] your [ __ ] stinks like a [ __ ] you are not that [ __ ] don&amp;#39;t S type of person you know your [ __ ] stinks and it stinks like [ __ ] okay so um up that was a damn good job with your second round girl that was genius then having them mow the carpet like it was grass with a vacuum cleaner that was hilarious that is what really got you into running that is what really got you into running so that was good now anyway this is what we have and you know what&amp;#39;s so interesting [ __ ] want to talk about how the beef sector has like you know been reduced to this 2.0 [ __ ] or people be talking about I&amp;#39;m tired of the plays and all this other crap first of all ain&amp;#39;t nobody running no plays over here let&amp;#39;s be very clear ain&amp;#39;t nobody running no plays over here but look at the OG&amp;#39;s take a look at the OG&amp;#39;s I mean let&amp;#39;s be serious y&amp;#39;all Jay Wilson is so pathetic at this juncture in his YouTube Journey he is literally moving backwards trcy has moved so backwards that she&amp;#39;s already fallen off the face of the [ __ ] Earth okay trcy has moved so back that she has fallen off the face of the Earth so she&amp;#39;s not even worth a mention but for laugh purposes why not right then you got treasur Lane who has also demoted himself to a cussing panelist all these Losers of the beef sector that try to make it seem like they still matter like they used to no you don&amp;#39;t because you know what I see that y&amp;#39;all doing y&amp;#39;all think that y&amp;#39;all power is enough to what what you think y&amp;#39;all could do ignite a spaceship that&amp;#39;s already dusted broken and disgusted what do y&amp;#39;all think y&amp;#39;all power can do especially when you&amp;#39;re powerless see again we have treasure or Lane and Jay Wilson hiding the fact that they don&amp;#39;t like each other for real and trying to keep a friendship for the sake of not pleasing me Jay Wilson said it himself he literally said it himself y&amp;#39;all he said out of his mouth that he would never beef with treasure Lane even if he wanted to because he&amp;#39;s not trying to give me that pleasure now I will say this I know she is read and let her crash out that girl don&amp;#39;t let N she got [ __ ] running trains on her on her panel she went from no [ __ ] onto the panel to her busting it wide open for any [ __ ] that click the link child bab the beef sector in 2025 nice to meet you nice to meet you oh of course she would only talk about Reed because she&amp;#39;s a hater she&amp;#39;s a hater I mean Reed was live the other night and had more people in her chat than pizza y&amp;#39;all like this is what&amp;#39;s happening people are starting to wake up people are starting to wake up and I&amp;#39;m not mad at it I&amp;#39;m not mad at it at all because guess what while people want to talk about 2.0 and all this weird [ __ ] read you know Reed is the one that created that whole 2.0 narrative in the first place and y&amp;#39;all ran with it because when Reed said it we ran with it now all of a sudden it&amp;#39;s this whole to or give the credit where it&amp;#39;s due because Reed is the one that created it y&amp;#39;all hate her so much but y&amp;#39;all using her [ __ ] y&amp;#39;all had so and how was Zulu doing jden see see he&amp;#39;s still not doing well what did the doctor say is wrong with him what did the doctor say is wrong with him now for those of you that are my members you and I or y&amp;#39;all and I we had a I put up a post earlier and I I put it out there for you guys to you know for you guys to tell me about how y&amp;#39;all feel you said you can tell me or you cannot tell me is that a typo because I don&amp;#39;t see why you wouldn&amp;#39;t just tell me but um I put up a post because a lot of you guys just seem really outraged about this Jay D thing and a lot of y&amp;#39;all are also new too and so I&amp;#39;m trying to kind of like I guess maybe understand like I&amp;#39;m trying to come to a compromise right because the thing about it I really get over [ __ ] quick um on this app on this app I can get over [ __ ] very quickly and I notice that some of you guys it you know some of you guys are noons type of people and I respect that you know I want those type of people around to be honest with you I don&amp;#39;t want you know a bunch of yes people around me even though it annoys me when you know I get my non-nonsense people I know that that&amp;#39;s what I need I recognize that that&amp;#39;s what I need you said we waited two hours hold on we waited two hours and the text says she didn&amp;#39;t say anything so he have to go to his primary care physician in the morning oh okay so you&amp;#39;re not there anymore you&amp;#39;re home now okay all right well yeah we I mean you know Zulu is not you so we definitely want to hope the best for Zulu because he ain&amp;#39;t did nothing wrong now I don&amp;#39;t know I just feel like I don&amp;#39;t I don&amp;#39;t stew on things as much as y&amp;#39;all do so I do hope that like you know you guys just kind of have faith in me and in the fact that I I do plan to make some changes as far as like how much nonsense I tolerate and that you guys in turn have to tolerate and deal with like I do plan to implement some changes so I know you guys see open panel Kiki you did such a good job Kiki Reed up all of y&amp;#39;all shout out to y&amp;#39;all so much for joining the competition that means a lot that really does mean a lot like you guys are just like y&amp;#39;all did y&amp;#39;all big ones just for even joining to begin with so thank you for that because you know you know it&amp;#39;s sick when you have a poll going and Ken almost had like 500 in the chat but only like a 100 200 people are voting do you know that equals to like people just hate watching y&amp;#39;all that means like people are literally just hating and watching they don&amp;#39;t want to help anybody win they don&amp;#39;t want to help anybody make money it&amp;#39;s really sick and honestly if anything I want to separate myself from those people which I think is already happened because more than likely they&amp;#39;re haters from the get-go more than likely they&amp;#39;re haters from the get-go so it just is what it is okay but like I said to you guys you know um Jayden you like to say how you care about your people I care about my people too I care about my people too and you know I can&amp;#39;t like ignore their um I can&amp;#39;t ignore their comments to me about what they feel about the platform you know I can also share with them my perspective but there&amp;#39;s always a compromise in everything and if there&amp;#39;s ever difficulty in making that work then certain things are just maybe not meant to be and that&amp;#39;s why I stand with that because one thing I cannot keep H happening is y&amp;#39;all kicking my ass every time like when I woke up this morning I did not think that y&amp;#39;all was going to be so like the way that y&amp;#39;all were that&amp;#39;s why I had to put that post up because I&amp;#39;m like okay wait let me talk to them let me talk to them so maybe I maybe I&amp;#39;m missing something maybe there&amp;#39;s a way I can understand it better you know so that&amp;#39;s why I put that Community waffles because I definitely wanted you guys to kind of let me know y&amp;#39;all perspectives of things CU I do care at the end of the day I mean y&amp;#39;all make me without y&amp;#39;all it ain&amp;#39;t no me and I recognize that so I also want you guys to understand that you know if I&amp;#39;m gonna come live I will make sure like if you like the title now says open Panel most people will already have the link drop I still haven&amp;#39;t even dropped it yet because I do want you guys to digest me first right like I want you guys to hear me first so you know if I do have a live I put open open Panel in the chat then I mean in the title I will drop the link yes Jay D may come up y&amp;#39;all yes some people y&amp;#39;all might not like may come up and I I get that y&amp;#39;all still stay for that but it seems like the issue that you guys have is where it turns into like it turns into just overt talking and and there&amp;#39;s just no order right it it the issue is the order so that is what I plan to work on okay now I hate to not want Jay done on the panel and I will hold on I&amp;#39;m G to pin theing because tonight is an open Panel like I actually wasn&amp;#39;t even going to come live honestly after the challenge but I said [ __ ] I&amp;#39;m off tomorrow why not so I will pin the link yes I feel like if we add that element of control to the panel then I think you guys will be a a lot cooler with like the way [ __ ] happens I really think what irritates y&amp;#39;all the most is like the chaos right and just the just the unnecessary chaos and I feel like if we eliminate that man we good like I think we&amp;#39;ll be good what okay let me see cuz this is interesting that title that name is interesting hold on let me bring you up baby what&amp;#39;s good smash it Miss Duke Pharaoh you gotta show them yeah I am I&amp;#39;m literally about to put the comment down okay Miss Mrs Dr Duke fari this is is my um my new marriage on YouTube um Trish huh since when you and Duke farell got married

tread okay so wait wait wait wait wait so you referring to Sour Patch and let me just say this I don&amp;#39;t like I feel like sour patch cuz she not only did it with you she did it with both of her impersonations I feel like SAR patch was and I&amp;#39;m not making excuses I feel like she was so into it but I I don&amp;#39;t agree when she went into that particular chapter of her her performance like I was like no you know that was that was a bit much so I had a feeling and I was so proud of you for not going off on her when you came back the second time because I had a feel I&amp;#39;m like oh my God I hope &amp;#39;s not about to come cuss her out but you did not do that you came up stop putting that thing up here J don&amp;#39;t tell me what to do don&amp;#39;t tell me what to do so anyway I&amp;#39;m tired of this thing j j stop it so anyways you are really trying to make me go through [ __ ] on purpose and I don&amp;#39;t like that you need to stop that but I don&amp;#39;t want to see that thing they close your eyes Okay so but anyway I think that she she was sent there to do that [ __ ] that&amp;#39;s why I was like okay because at first poverty and computer well I W say I but I said was the think the chat reacted like that hold on my boo is here my boo is here hold on underne management what&amp;#39;s up underne management hey boo hey how y did you not see the cash up on the wall was you bullshitting anyway man we gonna get to that in a minute new management but she did you not see she said in the chat well I knew you was co-hosting or whatever you was doing she in the chat and they when I guess y&amp;#39; asking her to come back she was saying oh she didn&amp;#39;t expect to go up there more than once I don&amp;#39;t even know this [ __ ] but yeah computer back put her picture on the wall ever since um King K or k whatever his name is exposed those text messages and and lemonad um Discord she got put on blast with the things that she was saying about computer back so once computer back saw that she took her picture and she was like a this such a cute piggy or some [ __ ] like that and then s patch went over there kissing her ass yeah that&amp;#39;s why I said that in the chat was laughing because it was true but wait a minute wait I&amp;#39;m sorry because I was reading a comment but you know sour Pat because Banna was cussing Sour Patch out right but she back over there good with she started at and she she she apologize and kiss Banna ring you know that&amp;#39;s how Banna like it so Banna well I don&amp;#39;t know I

Enterprise she say something happen over there I&amp;#39;ll go watch but lady I don&amp;#39;t think you been watching her so I don&amp;#39;t know what&amp;#39;s going on honestly I was shocked for me to red ball through that and see Sour Patch trying to imitate me I mean it was cute for the spirit of the competition but I mean why would you like what was talking about that because I don&amp;#39;t [ __ ] with her she done been blocked for a very long time now now if I had got up there and did my impersonation of ice coming to lock her ass up did that I I I know I&amp;#39;ve been had a block and

I see y [ __ ] why you J her for [ __ ] so she got send me no no my point is what the Android got to do with you not being able to see a cash app cuz I got an Android and I can see people saying that it&amp;#39;s different or something Jon I don&amp;#39;t know but guess what jayon how about this I know you really really uh NES it&amp;#39;s just an idea you can call me a [ __ ] now or call me a [ __ ] when I&amp;#39;m done all right no you don&amp;#39;t you don&amp;#39;t have to get you don&amp;#39;t have to give me no coaching about n no I&amp;#39;m not attitude with underne management J leave underne management alone because I can have I can have an attitude if I want to have one L J hold on hold on before you get the attitude um why don&amp;#39;t you ask ask n can you know you go over and visit her for the weekend y&amp;#39;all spend the weekend together just as friends you know y&amp;#39;all go to the movies or you know I go bowling or something go to dinner and then you come you know what I mean NE NES does not NES does not want the time of her life so no I&amp;#39;m not I&amp;#39;m not trying to do all that go ahead call me a [ __ ] go ahead I don&amp;#39;t need to call you a [ __ ] but to you because you already got heard word before I&amp;#39;m not calling you a [ __ ] I I don&amp;#39;t change you want me I you know I&amp;#39;m G to put up a poll asking has Jay done change cuz I&amp;#39;m YouTube I don&amp;#39;t care I&amp;#39;m put it right in they were saying my audio was bad I was asking if the audio was so bad it&amp;#39;s not bad for me like I think it&amp;#39;s a little it&amp;#39;s like a little crackling but it&amp;#39;s not it&amp;#39;s not annoying it&amp;#39;s not like I could tolerate it I don&amp;#39;t know about y&amp;#39;all but I could tolerate it just hold on what my problem is why in the world when I say something you always need to put a poll up I I don&amp;#39;t no anytime I say something whether about me changing me not trying to cuss a [ __ ] out or whatever you want to put up a poll what is your poll gonna prove because I&amp;#39;m still gonna be that you fa to realize just because you see my supporters typing in the chat I have 50% people that don&amp;#39;t [ __ ] with me listening that that they love my commentary they love my roasting and gagging but they hate me so there are that&amp;#39;s why the PO are still valid but the PO is still but you still put the poll there to discredit me no because what if you win the poll but then if you win the poll then what but either way the the premise of you putting the poll is to discredit me my no the premise of me putting the poll is to see if the people share the same opinion as you that&amp;#39;s all it&amp;#39;s not about how can I discredit what you say it can&amp;#39;t be it can&amp;#39;t be they they sharing the same opinion as me because it&amp;#39;s my own change it&amp;#39;s my own which is why I can&amp;#39;t discredit it so you shouldn&amp;#39;t take it personal cuz you know how you feel and always throwing up a pole I&amp;#39;m sick of you throwing up a pole I&amp;#39;m sorry that you sick of it but we need to know if the people believe that you changed because I don&amp;#39;t I don&amp;#39;t you gotta let a woman you don&amp;#39;t have to believe it and that&amp;#39;s what Under New Management she can&amp;#39;t do that because she child anyway go ahead under new man finish schooling her cuz she needs some old school stud uh schooling go ahead Under New Management Under New Management can&amp;#39;t teach me a [ __ ] thing she she&amp;#39;s old school stud she can teach you but but I ain&amp;#39;t no stud underne management probably don&amp;#39;t even know what her gspot is she can&amp;#39;t tell me [ __ ] wow so under new manag don&amp;#39;t let Jay D play on your why wouldn&amp;#39;t I know where my G where the g-spots at why wouldn&amp;#39;t I know that I said where yours at you need to know where yours at and I don&amp;#39;t believe you know where it&amp;#39;s what about Under New Management could give off that that impression she is she&amp;#39;s not even like an overtly sexual person where she&amp;#39;s always talking about you know doing stuff like that so why would you even say that because you just called her old school stud and old school studs don&amp;#39;t even know that they have a G-spot so woman not even every woman knows they have a G-spot go ahead new manag I&amp;#39;m not going to uh come back at that for the simple fact it&amp;#39;s just doesn&amp;#39;t it sounds I&amp;#39;m it just sounds it&amp;#39;s stupid what she saying so I&amp;#39;m not even gonna dig into that but peace y&amp;#39;all y&amp;#39;all have a good night all right Under New Management thank you for coming up all right later up and under man I&amp;#39;m not upset with you okay all right later oh the infamous Sour Patch is up here and Sour Patch let me just say this you know while Bri oh but they said you

giggling child D done why you got to do me like that because I don&amp;#39;t like all that but no I I&amp;#39;m a lesbian I came out at the age of 14 [ __ ] is all that I know I&amp;#39;m a lesbian too jayon for real respect shut up so wait let me ask hold on Jayden let me ask you a question have you ever even kissed a boy or a guy like ever even kissed a guy uh well yes my best friend I did I kissed him how old were you it was in junior high and did you like it what what was the experience I didn&amp;#39;t like it but the crazy part about it is the only reason why I kissed him is because I had already came out and my mama said how do you know that you gay if you ain&amp;#39;t never been with a boy so then I kissed my friend because I want I was trying to see like well okay I ain&amp;#39;t been with no boy so let me kiss them and see and I ain&amp;#39;t like it was it a pop kiss or like a make out kiss no it was just just a kiss like a kiss it was no make out well I don&amp;#39;t know cuz I don&amp;#39;t know what I don&amp;#39;t know what stra people do n what not like straight people some sort of aliens [ __ ] like what youan you know what straight people do girlo it&amp;#39;s only a couple types of kissing it&amp;#39;s french kissing pop kissing or making out like what well I&amp;#39;m saying that I was in junior high school when this happened and it was honestly because my mama did not believe that I was gay because she felt like I was um prematurely you know labeling myself as such and she was like but you ain&amp;#39;t even been with boys how do you know and so I kissed my best friend and I didn&amp;#39;t like it they done so if you saying that not no disrespect but that means you had to do more than kiss right if you&amp;#39;re saying like you you tried I no I was I was in uh I want to say seventh grade eighth grade no so you&amp;#39;ve never you&amp;#39;re you&amp;#39;ve never had intercourse with a man ever never never I mean okay I respect it I mean and I think it what I think is crazy is how people find it so unbelievable that I I&amp;#39;ve never had a man huffing and puffing on top of me why is that so accurate for those that are straight obviously go ahead I don&amp;#39;t get why people act like this is such a big deal no upy have you ever kissed a girl upy you still there upy I see you unmuting but we still can&amp;#39;t hear you for some reason okay she going to have to come back Mr West I noticed that you have taken some sort of interest in like the Jay dun and Nest type of situation I mean what is your end goal with this whole thing like if there is one what are you trying to like figure out because honestly there really isn&amp;#39;t nothing to figure out you know I think y&amp;#39;all I think y&amp;#39;all cool and as a straight man you know I definitely want to hang around to both y&amp;#39;all Jay say she get she got she get [ __ ] off YouTube and this I know you get women off YouTube so it sound like we looking for the same thing oh so you looking for women you you&amp;#39;re you&amp;#39;re single and you&amp;#39;re looking to mingle yeah but my my case is I only [ __ ] with wh I&amp;#39;m that&amp;#39;s sick oh hold on up is back let me bring her back up hold on uh yeah can you hear me now yep loud and clear okay yeah the answer your question you know that&amp;#39;s a hell no no thank you okay yeah now I saw I saw that your that you uh your day was brighten because in ber de impersonated me why would my day be brighten I already knew and burette was coming as you from the get-go and speaking of that what did you think of the impersonation challenge while you over here talking I thought it was cute I thought it was really was yeah it really was yeah and you know in ver that I think she she did Justice to me but you know I was shocked the way she portrayed me like I was just so shocked at that because I don&amp;#39;t think but I didn&amp;#39;t see I didn&amp;#39;t see yours though I didn&amp;#39;t know she uh impersonated you because I was still at the vet with Zulu so I was missing a lot of stuff I had the red ball so I missed oh she definitely impersonated me and she had her thighs all out with the waist training and I&amp;#39;m thinking to myself I do not be doing like that like you be doing that what you do no up tries to like show her ass and stop that never happen when I&amp;#39;m dancing it&amp;#39;s something different but I don&amp;#39;t just come on live like that no if that&amp;#39;s the case I do dances so keep that in context huh I&amp;#39;m here to ask some juicy questions Ser go ahead so the of you have told me that you have got females off of this app if you had to say a certain amount and be honest to only had one female and that was somebody who I was actually um involved with jden I thought you told me next more than one person n had a one night stand off this app call it a one night stand I mean you could call it a one night stand I don&amp;#39;t really care what yall call it you know honestly it was a one night stand but what you what you trying to ask hold on but by definition a one night stand is when you sleep with somebody and that&amp;#39;s sit in that s there was nothing before or after it so you know there&amp;#39;s that whoa so wait so no feelings was involved thank you Bernie oh definitely they had feelings involved but what&amp;#39;s my question I&amp;#39;m ready for mine J done now you know you told me you said you mess with a couple of females off this app give a specific that&amp;#39;s fact um so the ones that I&amp;#39;ve actually had sexual intercourse with what sexual relation with um three but virtual sex about seven damn what the [ __ ] so wait so the three I already know who one is who is the other two Miss I I I never tell my business that&amp;#39;s the reason why Jayden you&amp;#39;ve had sex with three people off of YouTube and we only know about one who is the other two why would I but why would I do that though then you say you don&amp;#39;t kiss and tail but you want me to kiss tell but we deserve to know your business hell why you deserve to know a [ __ ] thing you don&amp;#39;t deserve to know nothing okay well let me ask you this the other two women do we know them like are we are they like subscribers that we don&amp;#39;t really know about or not even in the be yeah most of it is subes that the subes that be underground um remember the the one girl will H man I&amp;#39;m not new to this I&amp;#39;m true to it hold to me but go ahead about how they gonna tell me about who I [ __ ] I don&amp;#39;t know that&amp;#39;s well that&amp;#39;s what I asking before you could hear my mic the fact that you never slept with a guy why do you use a gillo because you don&amp;#39;t even know what you&amp;#39;re missing so why do that no I use a deal though because I&amp;#39;m sorry I me the other way around like I can see you having to do it for the girl because most girls you know they at least expen at some point right but for yourself why do you participate let people do it to you because like because I know I have a gspot and I want you to reach it the [ __ ] you mean don&amp;#39;t you have a G-spot damn but I don&amp;#39;t but I but I like guys like if I to me if I was you and you I wouldn&amp;#39;t want to stimulate sex that women have with men either that&amp;#39;s just my thing if I was well I I know that I got a gspot hi Uncle CL so that was a very ignorant question up wait what was a lot of well I you don&amp;#39;t consider yourself a St but a lot of women that I know that are masculine presenting they don&amp;#39;t want that part to be used dildo to be used on them they have one to use but that Ain me that ain&amp;#39;t me that ain&amp;#39;t me but up that&amp;#39;s why there&amp;#39;s different kinds of lesbians it can be pretty intricate like you have lesbi and and it&amp;#39;s sometimes I be thinking like is it a mental thing too because it&amp;#39;s like you got lesbians who you know hate dick but I don&amp;#39;t understand the logic of hating dick yeah I don&amp;#39;t understand either I don&amp;#39;t get it yeah I don&amp;#39;t I don&amp;#39;t understand that it&amp;#39;s like but in my like crazy for Action that I know a lot of not you&amp;#39;re not crazy first of all there&amp;#39;s such thing as a give you a hold on I&amp;#39;m G give you a chance there&amp;#39;s no such thing as a stupid question but you know up is straight so Jayden you should expect maybe some of her questions to not make sense to you because she doesn&amp;#39;t understand the way our minds work and yeah I&amp;#39;m sorry and you should have seen the memes they used to make like us to like they had this one meme this is around the time when young Mia was like real popular and stuff and and they had this meme going around I guess she used to always talk about getting head or whatever so this guy he made a meme he was like anybody who who who sucks on a plastic paint and moan and the person that&amp;#39;s have a plastic strap on saw a I saw a flick of a girl of a of a and you know what&amp;#39;s so interesting why don&amp;#39;t they have enough stud cat see the thing is I was never really into masculine females or studs um before this heat and like even young Mia I been know about young miia but I never looked young Mia in no way like damn but then after this heat baby I&amp;#39;m looking at all these little these little studs like I wonder what I could you know for me my thing is I be thinking to myself I wonder what I how I could make them you know feminine in the bed like like yeah you&amp;#39;re a stud but the thing that like turns me on is turning them into a fem in the bedroom like that&amp;#39;s my let me say one thing but n told me this NES told me this years ago no I did not I did not because I was never into studs stop it I was never into male you always told me that it was about the Chas you always told me that girl but that&amp;#39;s not the same stop trying to stop it now you over here complaining [ __ ] to try to make a point that&amp;#39;s the best [ __ ] I ever got in the world was from and not to say but from a d the no the male presenting on right like the cancer I can&amp;#39;t the reason why I can&amp;#39;t cancer man but anyway one of his friends he was a it was a she was tall kept a low buzz cut used to because they used to play basketball when she used to play basketball with them she would have her strap on adjusting it like she was one of the guy it was funny as hell but come to find out she was sleep with this [ __ ] once a year I never knew the particular a why but yeah he said every year for like the past 10 years and only once a year she picked them and he wasn&amp;#39;t even that like out of all his friends he was like the fat B short one I don&amp;#39;t know why she picked them but yeah crazy so some of them do do it so I ain&amp;#39;t crazy that&amp;#39;s like yeah fact my home girl my home girl in Houston she went viral she her and her girlfriend her girlfriend named NBA it&amp;#39;s a big girl got a big ass I yeah me all right of went viral everybody thought she was whole time she take more dick than her girlfriend yeah but if you&amp;#39;re not in the lesbian world you wouldn&amp;#39;t understand it I know a lot of lesbians probably like child lesbian no I&amp;#39;m saying but the way you&amp;#39;re telling the story is like it&amp;#39;s big news and it&amp;#39;s not it was it went viral but I&amp;#39;m saying not for lesbians like that is not no no no it went viral in the lesbian Community First CU they was portraying themselves to be lesbians like this whole time and then like Oh you mean she take real dick I&amp;#39;m think you talk about plastic dick real dick no yeah no hell no we talking about real dick like got exposed getting the brain maybe she bisexual then right but they were saying it was lesbians that&amp;#39;s the thing like you know what let me tell y you know what I was talking about day I think that there is a difference because you can&amp;#39;t call somebody a Les if they doing that with men now no she just whoever she is they was lying that&amp;#39;s what she want do some women J that&amp;#39;s bisexual that have sex with men and women we know about B sexuals I mean slit chick hey man slit chick is sweety look at sweetie here Jen please any no no let me slick chick I don&amp;#39;t know if it&amp;#39;s her what&amp;#39;s chick oh it is her hey sweetie how in the hell

going to like do that no for me to be up here be up here all right um ZX is that you hey how you doing I am doing well thank you so much for participating in the impersonation challenge tonight we appreciate your efforts um that was very dope of you I yeah one of the Riders uh woke me up and they was like go over there and do it so I woke up and I was like all right and that&amp;#39;s why I did it I have actually overslept so meant to be there earlier so that&amp;#39;s uh that&amp;#39;s why I okay I I got a question yeah um about the the and I&amp;#39;m not being factious I I really want to understand okay about the stud thing all right is is that okay it&amp;#39;s fine go ahead okay all right for women who date what you call studs remember I did commentary about um just Christa and just Christal was saying she wanted a stud but she was selfish she didn&amp;#39;t want to touch the S she she wasn&amp;#39;t gonna give the the stud what the stud gave her she wasn&amp;#39;t GNA you know recognize the stud in any capacity of being a a woman or treating or reciprocating reciproca a name for that though there are a lot of them but go ahead yeah the pillow princess absolutely y okay well here&amp;#39;s my question so now we got it defined so that&amp;#39;s cool so we got it defined here&amp;#39;s my thing and my question to just Crystal was if you want something or someone and I&amp;#39;m I&amp;#39;m trying to be as politically correct as possible if you want a person in your life that resembles a man can you please you have a little bit of background noise going on Boo let me find it I I can do it for you you want me to do it for you yes okay all right give me one second all right go ahead ZX okay I was muted I&amp;#39;m sorry if you oh my goodness I muted you instead of sing I am so sorry right go ahead okay so if you if you want someone in your life that resembles a man that has all of the qualities and traits of a man why not be with a man that that&amp;#39;s my only question now and in particular in particular uh just Christ said well she&amp;#39;s not going to reciprocate sexually in any way she&amp;#39;s not going to touch to her that would be her I guess being a lesbian because she would find some you know it would be icky to her the way she described it I mean so my question is again if you want a man or someone to act look and treat you like a man why not be with one I I&amp;#39;ll mute up now let me just say this right you know what&amp;#39;s interesting is I hold on Mr what Mr West why do you unmute to laugh make back on mute read your back chat all right hold on oh my Lord have mercy Jesus all right so quite frankly quite frankly Jayden okay well Jayden do what you have to do because I&amp;#39;m I&amp;#39;m about to answer his question so I don&amp;#39;t this is not for you to air out your grievances um anyway quite frankly I should be able to say how I feel up here okay you did now me you a you you didn&amp;#39;t dismiss these men um Jayden you do know that like shanice&amp;#39;s money is running out really quick with all of your interruptions so it&amp;#39;s like I&amp;#39;m not going to play this game with you tonight I&amp;#39;m not in theid no but but the problem is muted to say something I am muted to say something these men that came up here and you you received everything they said but now you gonna tell me it&amp;#39;s my you been up here like girl stop it stop being a and that&amp;#39;s why people in the sector is saying that you&amp;#39;re becoming whiny all of a sudden and they&amp;#39;re getting sick of your whining they&amp;#39;re saying that came my period came on I can on my perod whing all I and I can do it and I can do it just like they [ __ ] J so grown folks you know what&amp;#39;s interesting I just want this might not answer your question but I just wanted to say something because I remember when you was like oh it&amp;#39;s so selfish like how could you not want to you know please somebody that&amp;#39;s pleasing you and all that other stuff but you know for me the whole pillow princess thing is um it it&amp;#39;s a just for one night type of situation like for the person that&amp;#39;s doing it at least in my case like one night one night with a whole pillar print shut your ass up so but that&amp;#39;s what you did here&amp;#39;s my okay I&amp;#39;m gon mute you so Jayden so um you&amp;#39;re right black girls cold and um shaes your money is running out quick so just know that so anyways um ZX yeah but for me I&amp;#39;m a pillow princess don&amp;#39;t just mean any [ __ ] like if it&amp;#39;s if if I&amp;#39;m going to consider you a pillow princess which I&amp;#39;ve had some pillow princesses in my day if I&amp;#39;m going to consider you a pillow princess you better look the [ __ ] part okay like because a pillow princess is a [ __ ] that&amp;#39;s I&amp;#39;m just I plan on never seeing again like it&amp;#39;s not a [ __ ] that I&amp;#39;m gonna continue to entertain like because [ __ ] where there&amp;#39;s one there&amp;#39;s others and they might look better than you so and that&amp;#39;s just my way of thinking to be honest with you so I just want you to understand like with that whole pillow princess thing it&amp;#39;s not even about the person that&amp;#39;s being pleased it&amp;#39;s the person that&amp;#39;s doing the pleasing and like from that perspective I just want you to understand like it&amp;#39;s not just anybody that can be one like you literally have to like have like a perfect body like you have to have like a a good body like you have to like there&amp;#39;s things about you that have to be pillow princess worthy for you to even encounter me like you know that&amp;#39;s the type of [ __ ] I be on but um as far as like the the women having sex with men and all that other with women and wanting peen fake peen and not real P you know for me it&amp;#39;s interesting because I think that you know somehow in in some way in their minds they&amp;#39;re able to separate penetration from the fact that like it&amp;#39;s a man so it&amp;#39;s like they&amp;#39;re able to get the same pleasure through penetration and they&amp;#39;re not thinking like okay this is a man doing it because that doesn&amp;#39;t turn them on so like when when women who want dildos or vibrators or they want penetration but they don&amp;#39;t want to be fooled with the man at all I feel like these women somehow have had a way to like separate men equaling penetration straight women when they think about penetration they think about a [ __ ] penetrating them but these women when they think about penetration they just think about the feeling and what&amp;#39;s the best object that causes it like what&amp;#39;s the best dildo that can make me feel this s what&amp;#39;s the best I mean there&amp;#39;s different things unfortunately that some people use that are into that but that&amp;#39;s a different story but I don&amp;#39;t think that they think about the man do you understand what I&amp;#39;m trying to say no who you talking to hold on wait because you don&amp;#39;t you don&amp;#39;t if you have something to add to it then please I would because you are one of the women that we&amp;#39;re talking about so not rainy said I&amp;#39;m correct well then maybe I really am thank you rainy but not I I want you to weigh in on it because I know that you are the epitome of this kind of person so ZX if you don&amp;#39;t mind let&amp;#39;s let Jay Dunn give her her piece on it because that&amp;#39;s intended sure so the the first penetration that I ever had was from a girl and we didn&amp;#39;t know what in the hell we was doing we was just touching each other and exploring we got hands fingers so she knew what she was doing if she was able to penetrate you I mean but but I&amp;#39;m seeing it came from a girl first so these people that be like well you don&amp;#39;t know about penetration unless a man did it that&amp;#39;s a damn lie My First Girlfriend her daddy um had a shaver you know an electric shaver up in the bathroom that VI no going on me we okay let me give y&amp;#39;all a plug Jayden you just I&amp;#39;mma give y&amp;#39;all a plug if y&amp;#39;all go to the Dollar Tree they got a toothbrush in there that is called Dr fresh and it come with two pieces no hold on I&amp;#39;mma tell y&amp;#39;all some real [ __ ] go to Dollar Tree and they have a toothbrush that is called Dr fresh it comes with two pieces the bristle head and the bottom throw the BR throw the bristle head in the garbage you don&amp;#39;t even need the top right use the J hold on J Let Me Tell yall something for a150 you will have one of the best CS in your life do you hear me when I tell y&amp;#39;all throw the Bristol part in the garbage and keep that bottom piece all you need is one battery go in your bed close your eyes baby it will do some things for you that the rose could never I&amp;#39;m trying to tell you I&amp;#39;m giving yall a plug get you that vibrating toothbrush from Dollar Tree for $150 and throw the brush part in the garbage and keep the bottom but go ahead I swear to God no we ain&amp;#39;t talking about you being attracted we talking about this is what I was doing um in middle school so no I&amp;#39;ve never dealt with a man never needed to deal with a man because I was a lesbian okay J what I was saying because I&amp;#39;m the one I brought subject up what I&amp;#39;m saying to you not just you per I just always thought it was kind of odd because I understand you want to get a good feeling but why would the for why would your good feelings come in a form of something that&amp;#39;s shaped like a penis like there are so many other things I guess you could try to do I would think that would be the last thing that give you the most pleasure because the female anatomy the the G-Spot is still right there and I wish you would understand cuz I think I just explained this to you up I have a that was my that was my mind perception you know right but well get get your perception happen from just oral I feel like that can happen from just oral so you cannot reach somebody spot not through oral not through oral you can&amp;#39;t reach the gspot maybe you don&amp;#39;t even know where yours is it&amp;#39;s in the canal up so it&amp;#39;s not like clearly with oral that&amp;#39;s what I said she she doesn&amp;#39;t know talking about a g spot I&amp;#39;m talking about a G-spot you don&amp;#39;t know the female anatomy and no um you talking abouty I actually gave birth but let&amp;#39;s not have a but my thing is this my thing yes no it&amp;#39;s the truth but my thing is this if you had your G-spot touch and you&amp;#39;re not into men why would that even be at the for SP because you can get a happy end there with just head I feel like y just want the penis Happy who is talking about a happy ending when I know I&amp;#39;m I&amp;#39;m specifically speaking about my G-spot but but J hold on J hold on but Jayden let me say this to up up you have to also understand some women don&amp;#39;t want a hard man&amp;#39;s body they want to feel breast they want to feel soft body they don&amp;#39;t want to like that [ __ ] don&amp;#39;t turn them on they don&amp;#39;t like to feel a hairy chest they don&amp;#39;t like to feel an Adam&amp;#39;s apple they don&amp;#39;t want to feel a gold te like there&amp;#39;s certain things they don&amp;#39;t want to smell a man&amp;#39;s pheromones there&amp;#39;s like certain things that like when women are lesbians it&amp;#39;s not even about the penetration there&amp;#39;s so many more things attached to it that comes to the man itself that their body just rejects so it&amp;#39;s like you have to understand even I the main thing they will reject is anything in a form of of a penis no it&amp;#39;s not because it&amp;#39;s hold on because it&amp;#39;s selfish for you to assume that the only way a woman would want their G-spot touched is through a penis if you already feel that way about a man meaning you don&amp;#39;t want their testosterone body you don&amp;#39;t want that muscle you don&amp;#39;t want that that hairy chest them perky nips you don&amp;#39;t want to feel that that goatee I mean it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s selfish for you to think that that that&amp;#39;s the only way for them to get it and they have to go through that to find it now in our vaginas you act like we could put all type of foreign objects in there obviously the vagina was built for a penis but if your mind is in a place where you&amp;#39;re not there you are going to try to get to that spot by any means and the world has made it so you can get there without a man so it just is what go ahead I&amp;#39;m sorry I wanted to add something I&amp;#39;m listening I&amp;#39;m listening to you and and I&amp;#39;m really really trying to understand it I really enjoy the mind because I think through the mind everything exists everything what I thought was that it was based on an emotional connection as a man how I tried to rationalize it is that uh women relate more to another woman and you&amp;#39;re emotional creatures and the physical part of it was secondary and it was more about the emotional connection and so what I&amp;#39;m hearing from you um is that it&amp;#39;s a when you talk about being repulsed by the physicality of a man that part I I would I have more questions I would like to find out why but I can understand it a little bit better um but from my standpoint as a heterosexual man I I&amp;#39;m I was always confused and let me say this clearly and respectfully I never ever looked down on women who were attracted to other women I felt as though it was a failure of a man and that is something that the gay men in our sector don&amp;#39;t like about you which is interesting like but that&amp;#39;s a lie that&amp;#39;s a lie this man are threaten violate me in all types of [ __ ] oh my Jaden why would you we not there right now again let me reiterate I don&amp;#39;t look at studs or fims or pillow princess I look at them all of you as women and my desire my natural desire is for a woman whether it be short tall think it it it I don&amp;#39;t see a separation line when it comes to well she&amp;#39;s a lesbian oh okay well you&amp;#39;re still a woman at the end of the day and I find that to be appealing um but when it came to woman on woman again I try to rationalize it as either something traumatic or as I heard earlier experimental as some point uh we know children do uh experiment at young ages I mean a newborn a baby one years old uh they touch themselves they become familiar with themselves it&amp;#39;s a natural thing but when it but when the baby is doing it it there I mean they have no it&amp;#39;s not like that is connected we&amp;#39;re talking right okay right they&amp;#39;re just exploring themselves they&amp;#39;re figuring out fingers toes what you know they&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re learning but my perception was that it was an emotional connection and that is where you know two women were Bond I never thought it was about a physical repulsiveness or attraction I thought it was because you understood each other but what I witness is that um it it can be abusive just like any other relationship worse because the emotions are you know right I don&amp;#39;t know I don&amp;#39;t know why we what it we teaching um predatory men what what are we doing here what we&amp;#39;re doing is having an adult conversation I mean she has a good point no but we&amp;#39;re having an adult conversation and if you&amp;#39;re saying something but no what I&amp;#39;m saying is I&amp;#39;m not going to respond to comment that you make that have nothing to do with me so just be prepared if you have something to say because that&amp;#39;s something I&amp;#39;m not doing anymore either somebody&amp;#39;s backstage that&amp;#39;s fine you keep bringing all these people up here but this is a predat I didn&amp;#39;t say I don&amp;#39;t okay um Queen hello yes Queen Tulsa security is here do we have a uh do we have a dis dis do we have a disruption no we&amp;#39;re having a conversation oh okay Ness is having a but to be honest Queen Tulsa um I have the heie you know what they said Hold on hold on TOA they said NES can you ask ZX and Mr West if they would sleep with the St like young M ma if off of course they would is that even a question they don&amp;#39;t look at studs as men they&amp;#39;re women some men some men would [ __ ] a stud quicker than they would [ __ ] a f just because of the of [ __ ] a stud like no do you know why because you here&amp;#39;s the thing you want me to tell the truth well let me tell you all my wait wait let me tell you all the reasons why I think which is maybe two but I will tell you one because like I said the thrill but two I feel like some men see studs as untouched they see them as like real fresh meat and it&amp;#39;s like you know and I&amp;#39;m not going to hold you part of that is is true because you know studs they don&amp;#39;t have like a they don&amp;#39;t have like a high body count they ain&amp;#39;t got no high body counts some have none at all and it just I didn&amp;#39;t say all I said some and well I&amp;#39;m talking about my own my own reasons but go ahead Z well you you hit it the ladder is correct um I was with I guess two women that would consider themselves St first of all it was like it was like unwrap a uh Christmas present yes it was because I was surprised at at the at the body because it was hidden it was hit and and and you when you unwrap it it was like wow oh wow I know you&amp;#39;re not bonding with this Predator um Jay I know you going to stop dragging this man why he&amp;#39;s not even paying you no attention like you wanton his attention so bad and well you all the whole conversation most of us on the pan don&amp;#39;t even deal with him this is like rude very uncomfortable uncomfortable all right I&amp;#39;m gonna get ready because you guys can leave protect you don&amp;#39;t have to stay here y&amp;#39;all can leave I promise y y can leave I&amp;#39;m y&amp;#39;all can leave protect us ZX finish what you was saying I dis agreeing with your with your observation um we we do feel as though is it&amp;#39;s about the closest thing you can get to a virgin in our mind it&amp;#39;s like well uh she Ain been ran by bye your ass out of here go ahead she hasn&amp;#39;t been ran the fact that you you&amp;#39;re pronging the conversation I don&amp;#39;t care if you got tired of it now go ahead ZX why you being know going to nobody even your chat is Bor right it&amp;#39;s like finish what you were saying ZX I I I was just trying to outline some of the points that you had made and agree with them and I found that the one one particular stud that I was with she actually admitted to me that it was more comfortable for her to take natural penis than a vibrator because the natural penis is more flexible and the pulsation was more pleasurable than the vibrator I I just wanted to add that component to the conversation okay and I mean I mean I&amp;#39;m an adult right and you know I&amp;#39;ve experienced both sides of the world so you know I&amp;#39;m able to like I listen to what you were saying and I wasn&amp;#39;t creep I literally took you seriously like I was literally having an adult grown conver ation but you know some people are used to after dark live streams where they&amp;#39;re just talking about hot horny sex and want to talk about this uh sex machines and the the inches of their dildos but then when people want to have an actual conversation they want to act outraged meanwhile they have a whole machine to [ __ ] them whenever they have that itch that they can&amp;#39;t scratch [ __ ] we ain&amp;#39;t got time these talking points it was my he came up here did you forget that I say I&amp;#39;m dropping y&amp;#39;all I&amp;#39;m trying not to drop y&amp;#39;all Y hold on no no what you think you need to hold on hold on to that thought um because we&amp;#39;re trying to we&amp;#39;re wrapping up this conversation that&amp;#39;s bothering y&amp;#39;all so much so aside from that ZX was there anything else you wanted to add no I thought I thought identifi you doing the most Girl by go ahead ZX is there anything else you wanted to add yeah I just wanted to put it in the Contex I was I was under one notion as to why and I&amp;#39;m I&amp;#39;m learning by listening and that&amp;#39;s how you learn you know being combative you&amp;#39;re never going to build a bridge you have to understand and I&amp;#39;m trying to understand and maybe some of my misconceptions are being obliviated and I have to deal with that myself and um I don&amp;#39;t I don&amp;#39;t hate you for your choices I may not understand them I may not agree with them um but only through conversation can I understand or other people understand and I appreciate your time that&amp;#39;s for being a mature adult I truly do appreciate it and the chat is not bothered so thank you very much for your input I appreciate you coming up ZX the chat was not bothered at all with what you were saying That&amp;#39;s because of that well I know definitely excuse me I just do commentary um and hold on J I&amp;#39;m M you again Jayden goddess of T you have a good night ZX who are you calling

that&amp;#39;s went live so we all know that you can go live they was talking about how the people left you Al when this went live so we all know let me say he let me hold on hold on Lion one second joyful on purpose yeah it&amp;#39;s me um let me fix my um can you guys hear me yeah we can hear you it&amp;#39;s very that&amp;#39;ss purpose that&amp;#39;s um she I know it&amp;#39;s a different name but yeah um yeah what will Jesus do Jesus take Jesus the will Jesus take the will yeah what would Jesus do I knew Jesus take the will hi Jesus take the will I&amp;#39;m sorry let me go I Jesus take the will my bad go ahead what you said what you said D no n said what would Jesus do I said oh G it kind of like refreshed my memory like oh yeah it was like Jesus take the wh like a reference and I laughed at it I didn&amp;#39;t say it I was like who I know I know who this is but my bad okay let me go on me I&amp;#39;m sorry you know what I just wanted to just make one point I don&amp;#39;t know why this um my mic is not going to my my headset isn&amp;#39;t going on um so I&amp;#39;m not hearing you to the headset but I just wanted to say to jayon um even though if she thinks that um what&amp;#39;s his name Z ZX was up there to trigger her or whatever it was it was a great discussion I enjoyed it than thank you I appreciate that not everything is in attack yeah and not only that it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s sometimes you have to what you know dismiss the person that you think the message is for and think of the wider area in which is being spread because it&amp;#39;s not only for him but it&amp;#39;s for a lot of men a lot of women who may not un you know understand what is going on it relationships and female and female relationships so it was a really good discussion for people who are not part of the community and even for men listening in because um and I wanted to call in when he was there as well but I just didn&amp;#39;t get the opportunity to say that um for a lot of men that think that they can turn women on or whatever I think that&amp;#39;s a small population compared to the largest scale a lot of men don&amp;#39;t think like that um I have brothers I don&amp;#39;t have any sisters and I have a lot of brothers and they have never thought like that I have spoken to a lot of men that don&amp;#39;t think like that and um it&amp;#39;s not only just about a mental thing that he thinks that it is that you know it has to be that um sex is something mental for women just like it could just be physical for women and not a penis does not define a sexual relationship so to say that you know you can only feel satisfied by having a penis is [ __ ] and you know like um real long time thinking um so I think that this discussion opened up a lot of people eyes and it was a great discussion to me it was a great discussion no thank you very much Jesus thank you I hope I&amp;#39;m not getting um you know beat up in the chat but I enjoyed it I really enjoyed it because I&amp;#39;m not looking at the person who&amp;#39;s the messenger I am looking at I&amp;#39;m listening to the messages and it was right very enlightening you know the whole discussion to me so big up to you for having it um open but I think that um probably some more women could have come on and spoken about you know if more men came on that would just enable Jay done more right and it would be a situation where I have to end up dropping her because it really wasn&amp;#39;t about her and I just to thank you for being like a spectator like somebody who was watching and you know you&amp;#39;re kind of just like Drawing the Line because it gets blurred when Jay dun is up here trying to create fake outrage and there is none and you coming on here saying that you appreciated it matters go ahead I think for her it&amp;#39;s that she is triggered by him because of the things that he said and you can&amp;#39;t take that away from her feeling like but Jesus take the will Jay D is in the beef sector and has been here longer than most of us like come on like that all the time and that is why I said like for other women to come on the panel so they can give their perspective on um how they feel in terms of like even if you&amp;#39;re part of the um heterosexual but you you&amp;#39;re bisexual and for you it&amp;#39;s not necessarily um it&amp;#39;s not a pH it&amp;#39;s not a sex it&amp;#39;s not a mental thing it&amp;#39;s a physical thing because I think some men thinks it&amp;#39;s more that women are more mental um related to sex and physical whereas men feel as you know they are the sexual beings and they think everything for them is oh I can go have sex and not have a mental feeling it there are lots of women who do the same thing and men just they they label that as prostitutes but it&amp;#39;s for them it&amp;#39;s fine but a lot of women have sex with other women and it&amp;#39;s purely just for pleasure and they can have sex with men as well and it&amp;#39;s just p for pleasure bisexual that&amp;#39;s called bisexual hold on up wait wait wait let&amp;#39;s let dimples speak um dimples what did you want to say mine is completely off topic so y&amp;#39;all can wrap and by the way I&amp;#39;m only letting you speak because it&amp;#39;s your turn because it&amp;#39;s not out of respect for you cuz [ __ ] you&amp;#39;ve been doing too much and I&amp;#39;m clocking you so go ahead but she but she&amp;#39;s being respectful because she said it&amp;#39;s allic [ __ ] up I didn&amp;#39;t ask I&amp;#39;m just saying but she she she yielding her ter for real quick it don&amp;#39;t matter I wanted to make sure I said what I said because [ __ ] I&amp;#39;ve been seeing this whole move so what okay okay but what I want to say is this this is why this this is why I was reiterating that it was my talking point if you see the comments of some people in the p in in the chat they&amp;#39;re saying the things that he has said about women um gay women needing to be T have to take a real man P to be made straight so those questions that he came with were not own that&amp;#39;s what narcissis people do when they want attention they&amp;#39;ll try to act like somebody but he wasn&amp;#39;t even smart enough to bring up his own talking point he literally copied me and you allowed it and now yeah because he doesn&amp;#39;t he doesn&amp;#39;t understand if his if if his go if he wants to copy your talking points who cares he come over here he perspective no no no no it&amp;#39;s not his perspective he&amp;#39;s rep praising my appoint try to have a conversation on a panel not his perspective what is the problem with that what is the problem is he po about um gay women like I like I don&amp;#39;t think gay or straight women should deal with him like me I can&amp;#39;t get ZX y are some real fans of ZX like it&amp;#39;s crazy no no no no I&amp;#39;m I&amp;#39;m going by I&amp;#39;m addressing your chat like you&amp;#39;re not listening to your chat but you are giving people fighting for things that they did not do can you hear me no what I&amp;#39;m not listening to is just the the their opinions because this is not about that they have a right to them so I be a fool to sit there and try to evaluate each and every opinion in my chat that&amp;#39;s not the point they&amp;#39;re doing what the chat is supposed to do no one sits there and tries to speak on every comment no it&amp;#39;s about the panel so are you done can&amp;#39;t I&amp;#39;m getting interrupted so yeah that&amp;#39;s what I&amp;#39;m saying you have to watch these men that don&amp;#39;t you have to know what their intentions are for having a conversation if they just sit there and watch watch somebody else say who got that bad static if they just sit there and watch what somebody else say and then they hit a link and say it again is that they true feel or they say what they need to get in the door to find another victim Come mute all right jle say what you got to say yes hi um first I wanted to find out did did uh Jake ever disclosed what was wrong with Zulu she she just dropped CU she had to check on it&amp;#39;s given I think Jake has a touch of um manen um syndrome what kind of syndrome what kind of syndrome is it pronouncing it but it&amp;#39;s m u n c huh I know what it is I know what it is had whatever I can know when I&amp;#39;m mispronouncing something so you&amp;#39;re to say the mother was trying to you trying to say jayon his Gypsy Rose in her dog yes yes because she didn&amp;#39;t have she didn&amp;#39;t she talk about zul is not herself she was barking at the mirror did her dang like it is crazy it is her her thought was crazy wondering well I didn&amp;#39;t know like usually what would take a dog like she said the dog was barking in the mirror and was laying there so I wanted to know what was the other symptoms like wouldn&amp;#39;t there be something out the dog was puking [ __ ] on itself or I like you been talking to other people but that&amp;#39;s go to another to a emergency vet appointment not just a vet but emergency appointment and then she&amp;#39;s supposed to be so rich but yet she was begging for money to take him there that&amp;#39;s all I&amp;#39;m asking I think that she just was overreacting I [ __ ] with my [ __ ] Zulu I [ __ ] with Zulu big Zulu yeah and we all [ __ ] with CED but you know what I thought that was you know what I will say hold on I will say it was interesting to hear J D on pizaro trying to get

you you just asked me and I&amp;#39;m answering no you&amp;#39;re not because you&amp;#39;re not you&amp;#39;re not picking up what I&amp;#39;m putting down so you talking about when you call I&amp;#39;m not saying that I&amp;#39;m saying did you hear his commentary in the beginning of his life when when before he even dropped the thing for the Callins did you hear in his commentary in the beginning of the live when he was saying about how I just told you no okay so if you didn&amp;#39;t see that then then then relax you&amp;#39;re doing too much you didn&amp;#39;t even see it so so you need to relax because I just told you that the [ __ ] was not even argumentative he said he liked you but he understood that you was over talking so you for you to be like he should have just told me that girl he said it in his commentary and if you didn&amp;#39;t hear it then we don&amp;#39;t need to be doing all this because you didn&amp;#39;t hear it I don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s a situation got I don&amp;#39;t even know bring to you want him to call you bring it to my attention because I I feel like I know you King Roman news have a good report and I feel like if King Roman news is giving you constructive criticism whereas when I do it or somebody else does it you&amp;#39;ll see it as an insult if it comes from him I feel like maybe you&amp;#39;ll take it better so I brought it up because I felt like it would maybe that you would you would absorb it differently coming from him that&amp;#39;s it well and what I&amp;#39;m saying is no I did not hear that if I had heard it I would have talked to him about it um a man don&amp;#39;t tell me how to feel Lord I wish I could find that time stamp because I don&amp;#39;t thinking Roman news would would would strike me but I really want to find a time stamp where he said that because you need to hear it so you can hear found in the time but but I don&amp;#39;t care how I was delivered oh you don&amp;#39;t want to hear it I got you cuz you don&amp;#39;t you don&amp;#39;t you can play whatever you want [ __ ] you can play whatever you want to play n but I don&amp;#39;t understand what is going to change with me because you just sat here up you I&amp;#39;m old than King romen I&amp;#39;m old you just up here can&amp;#39;t tell me [ __ ] about how I feel excuse me but now you&amp;#39;re you&amp;#39;re just flip flopping you just said that if you heard it you would have had a conversation with him about it so clearly you would have Tak I would have addressed him about it but I didn&amp;#39;t hear it right and so when I say that I could if I wish I had the time stamp you talking about it won&amp;#39;t change nothing you&amp;#39;re you&amp;#39;re saying too many things at one time you&amp;#39;re not making sense to so hold on so listen to me so that I can make sense a man is not going to dictate anything I did not hear what he said if I had heard what he said when I was a part of his call in later on in the live I would have talked to him about it but I&amp;#39;m not going to bend over backwards because y&amp;#39;all tell me Well he said this who nobody told you nobody nobody told you to been over um is y&amp;#39;all understand I&amp;#39;m not going through nothing y&amp;#39;all I promise y&amp;#39;all you said I don&amp;#39;t deserve this really y&amp;#39;all listen we just I&amp;#39;m talking [ __ ] y&amp;#39;all I am not bothered I am not anything you guys I&amp;#39;m really just doing my show you guys I promise y&amp;#39;all I&amp;#39;m not going through nothing at least right now I&amp;#39;m not we I&amp;#39;m literally just kind of you know Cruise I&amp;#39;m on cruise mode cruise control so um you&amp;#39;re saying what your doctor prescribed medicine no I don&amp;#39;t like how it makes me feel you know so so so you&amp;#39;re so you&amp;#39;re going against your diagnosis um when I don&amp;#39;t like the way something makes me feel I&amp;#39;m gonna stop taking it did that&amp;#39;s how that work did you go to the doctor and say I need something new not yet but I will okay that&amp;#39;s all she just want to self-medicate she self-medicate any any this is not about me this is not about me we&amp;#39;re gonna move right along what I&amp;#39;m telling Jay D all she had to do is just accept like I did I said okay accept what the reason except

heard that weirdo was going around showing my pictures to random people and talking about me like these people are so pressed I&amp;#39;m so disgusted but I I can&amp;#39;t find her response but the day after I gave the letter she gonna share it to myself she ain&amp;#39;t reading it don&amp;#39;t do it but then talk about something you want to suck my man&amp;#39;s dick or whatever like [ __ ] like why are you putting your man&amp;#39;s funky dick um that you done gush off over on it I don&amp;#39;t want that dick so you sure I&amp;#39;m positive I don&amp;#39;t want nothing after that big

shakim and it was Chad gbt that wrote those letters wasn&amp;#39;t it dimes well they modified it I knew knew it response to you how do you feel about her response I didn&amp;#39;t even respond to her oh you banna&amp;#39;s okay so so anyway um let me tell you so her big ass gonna get up on breeze on the platform right so you could tell this a setup so I guess this is her new thing that she&amp;#39;s gonna have um Thug pettyville attacking people for her right so she gets up there talk about something where&amp;#39;s Dipple where&amp;#39;s dipples at and they&amp;#39;re like dipples left oh I want to come up there and address her letter so then all of a sudden here go Thug Petty tell something that ain&amp;#39;t no girl that&amp;#39;s a man so first of all oh so he knows me so you talk about it yeah I ain&amp;#39;t playing with that [ __ ] [ __ ] sorry that FF [ __ ] um um talking about something they want to suck my di what woman in their right mind is gonna go tell your man let&amp;#39;s take the trans thing out that someone said they want to suck your dick right and then I&amp;#39;m trans at that and I told y&amp;#39;all before that he kept responding to my things in the comments and she was come came so I already knew she was trying to put that she was a man but she looked like a man she said that she went and saw her brother today that she ain&amp;#39;t seen since seventh grade which I don&amp;#39;t get that but whatever Papa Was a Rolling Stone but he wasn&amp;#39;t the only one but I&amp;#39;ll get to that in a minute so listen uh honey so she sat up there and and um and he he heterosexual he sounded so zesty it was terrible you could tell was planing in there and then then she&amp;#39;s in there um talk about she calls herself reading top something don&amp;#39;t you ever come there and don&amp;#39;t worry about my situation we&amp;#39;ve been back and then she tried to talk about the Boo and ring and why she why how it was better that they took a part and everything but but I I tried to go back and see but up did she ever addressed the Mary thing the mared part of that cuz she did say something like oh he did something when I wasn&amp;#39;t with him but get married to somebody I can&amp;#39;t remember she just the part I just remember like it was funny because I remember I know I read your letter and I remember her whole thing of saying as she kept saying she didn&amp;#39;t read it she was she definitely did read it and then she SP I can&amp;#39;t exactly what it said I don&amp;#39;t remember and then she and how do you know about my dream um how do you know my dream was were trying to go viral with those workout videos and they were actually I help her do that she she she was too fat to think she&amp;#39;s not smart like she already admitted I idea the problem the problem is if she would have shown progress she would have went she would have went viral no she could have got madree [ __ ] for some reason like this is why they do like to see it because I just see how the view people her size I think people just happy to see like they not going to be sitting next to on an airplane or bus or train like yeah do what you got to do because you be taking up all the seats I don&amp;#39;t know what the underlying issue is but when they that side and they do exercise video I told her that it was gonna pop I even did it with her until was going she should have kept to it so that should have been her dream but you know what I don&amp;#39;t trust no man that been in jail for long well these days I don&amp;#39;t care if it was six months but they all I watch too many jail time story times I ain&amp;#39;t dealing with it but she in there pressing her she better do she better do the booty test on them while she sucking his dick I can tell you how to do it because she over there tells him pull up your pants I&amp;#39;m tired of seeing your ass yeah a sign of sagging is to tell of the bottoms and prison of the tops and prison that you are ready and open and clean so you&amp;#39;re not having a lemon experience like in Vegas so I thought that was quite funny and yeah so I don&amp;#39;t know if she ever did that but then she admitted okay so then she said that uh she basically ghost to him she blocked him and cut off his phone but then she tried to cover it up to oh no I have all his information and and and I cut off the phone and changed his number so which one is it you committed a crime what you we already know you docked and apparently used your job information for stuff so you had his social stuff and called the phone line and cut the man&amp;#39;s phone off or was he attached to your phone and that just perpetuates the narrative that um he&amp;#39;s a bum and living off of you either no that&amp;#39;s we know he&amp;#39;s living up with her if you believe anything differently you&amp;#39;re a goddamn lie she made up that L [ __ ] off the spot because I didn&amp;#39;t hear it but I think you were talking about lady that he said I just got out of jail I just got do a fing time and so what wait up up pause pause pause pause so that would make sense why he got married because you know you get special privileges if you&amp;#39;re married in jail so it might have made it a little easier for him to get married oh man I&amp;#39;m girl are sick it&amp;#39;s the truth but I didn&amp;#39;t even know because they ni came to that I was like oh wow and then he came he say nothing about no job but the reason I believe he had one because she had to come back and try to clean it up right and so then she came back out saying he was a la he was a business owner he did lawn M and when they was asking why he wasn&amp;#39;t at work he was like I look what time of night it is why would I be at work that sound like a man that never had a job you don&amp;#39;t even know it&amp;#39;s a 24hour a day thing girl yeah baby yeah cuz you you don&amp;#39;t want to cuz I know my grandma used to make us our ass get out before the sun got up and do yard work so that&amp;#39;s what you want to do with and I love about lady she&amp;#39;s a good gossiper I love to chat with lady she te I do I but I got but so I peeped that that was crazy she was in her feelings and he all in there some oh I was gonna say worse of that like y&amp;#39;all really set up there and rehears and disgust me that try to come drag me like that is embarrassing she don&amp;#39;t know how stupid and that just goes into how immature she is and how lack of a grown woman she is up and tell us about a grown woman and how they going to give up and how they gonna protect their man from the internet not have him on it ever oh it&amp;#39;s sick and she think it&amp;#39;s cute and did she tell some and and I don&amp;#39;t go live he ain&amp;#39;t the reason why I go live I can go live and he&amp;#39;ll just get mad and shut the door and go to bed he ain&amp;#39;t going to do nothing so that lets us know right there that he does have a problem with you going live and that&amp;#39;s why even if you&amp;#39;re sitting in the office he&amp;#39;s still screaming in the background or wanting to come on camera but you know her low self her esteem is so low she think she could play it off by saying she&amp;#39;s like she like you&amp;#39;re I can&amp;#39;t stand these people that&amp;#39;s in their mid-30s thinking they young you&amp;#39;re not young at all that say that for the 18 to 24 year old that&amp;#39;s not your lame boot grow up but number two she&amp;#39;s so excited to have a man she think it&amp;#39;s cute to say he&amp;#39;s a thug but he&amp;#39;s not even no hustling ass th he hustles women with low self-esteem that ain&amp;#39;t [ __ ] he&amp;#39;s a poty what they call that [ __ ] like girl you are so desperate and then he got all them goddamn kids and you don&amp;#39;t have any that should have been a hard no red flag number one one talking about calling him sonon I said girl wait she said that she yes the other day she was wait hold on wait wait wait wait wait wait say that again what happened she is calling the the boy son apparently there&amp;#39;s a one of the children either stay there or they get him way more frequent than the rest of them and they were getting ready to go somewhere go go down to Florida cuz she was like oh yeah we went down to the country to see our families and when they was getting ready you could hear me she&amp;#39;s like son son come here wow my mom would whoop somebody&amp;#39;s ass if they was calling us sonson or anything so Rihanna is really playing stepmama for real really playing stepmama yes interesting at her young age but you know what the thing about about it is you know what&amp;#39;s sad this is what obesity restricts you to because it&amp;#39;s like when you&amp;#39;re so big and fat you don&amp;#39;t want to go out you don&amp;#39;t want to do things so you have to like literally reduce yourself to being like a 60 year old at 30 you have to reduce yourself to like being a stepmom at your age and while you sitting over there talking [ __ ] about me talking about I&amp;#39;ll never be a mommy Briana you will never ever be able to be pregnant first [ __ ] because your uterus is smooshed what baby I mean your fat is not like it&amp;#39;s heavy metal [ __ ] you don&amp;#39;t have that fluffy fat think B baby any piece of sperm hold on any piece of sperm that makes it to your uterus is gonna inst be crunched by that mansion in the sky that is called your stomach [ __ ] so while you was talking about me never being a mamy [ __ ] you&amp;#39;ll never get pregnant that&amp;#39;s the thing see I have a uterus that got space and guess what the thing about me is I&amp;#39;m like I&amp;#39;m unlike other [ __ ] I had one son I had a situation I never had a kid again hell I I [ __ ] I stopped [ __ ] [ __ ] it got to a point where I stopped [ __ ] it got that deep but you [ __ ] you will never even know what it feels like to have a baby kick because your gas is like labor [ __ ] when it&amp;#39;s about the when you about to fart that&amp;#39;s like you giving birth bch you don&amp;#39;t even know you&amp;#39;ll never understand what it feels or what what it means to have a baby kicking your stomach to feel that poop poop po poop that little tumbling the babies do girl you get that all with your fat your fat is a jam-packed jimy [ __ ] so if you don&amp;#39;t get your big fat ridiculous useless dumb come Crum C catching ass out my face while you over there and then let&amp;#39;s talk about this the mother that loves her y&amp;#39;all like like I asked King Roman news on his panel like dimples up you guys you know up you&amp;#39;re a parent dimbles you&amp;#39;re not but you still have family so if if anybody in your family that you loved introduced they said oh I&amp;#39;m with some I&amp;#39;m in a relationship you on the phone imagine y&amp;#39;all on the phone up imagine you on the phone with your your kids and dimples imagine you&amp;#39;re on the phone with like some of your family your cousins or whoever that you really love dearly and they&amp;#39;re telling you oh my goodness I&amp;#39;m in a relationship I can&amp;#39;t wait for y&amp;#39;all to meet my girl I can&amp;#39;t wait for y to meet my girl D and you&amp;#39;re like oh my goodness okay and when you meet her it&amp;#39;s Briana five uh six foot one 950 pounds no no no seriously my thing to my thing to King Roman was what would your family say I know my family would probably banish me alone my family would banish me because my my family is very aesthetically pleasing so they&amp;#39;re not going to have me bring nobody that&amp;#39;s G to [ __ ] up our aesthetic so they&amp;#39;ll banish me but my question to y&amp;#39;all is what would y do family say so let me ask dimples first so dimples what would your F what would you say if you were introduced to somebody who you love in your family and it was somebody who was morbidly obese I&amp;#39;m curious I would say oh girl I know you can make a mean potato salad I&amp;#39;m on mute so wait but my question oh no no no but let me ask you this would you still be happy for that family member or would you pull them to the side and have a conversation I learned long ago cuz when I first start I was very vocal with my one first cousin and it caused the Uproar um so me personally I don&amp;#39;t talk on people&amp;#39;s spouses but we will but best believe that cousin text group they gonna get removed girl I got a group chat with my cousin and we like we like 26 deep baby you ain&amp;#39;t telling no lies right there dimples I know I know what you mean we got what right now we dragging okay but the thing is in my group chat with my cousins we drag our our moms because I have nine aunts so I have a lot of cousins we be dragging them because they our aunts argue more than us and we always tell each other go get her me and my cousins always tell tell each other we will not grow up to be like our moms I got twins I got aunts that are twins they all argue they all fight it&amp;#39;s always a rival but us the kids it&amp;#39;s a lot of us and we just be like baby we ain&amp;#39;t even [ __ ] with them let them argue but up what would you say if you know um your son or your daughter brought somebody home who was born would you still be happy for them and and be real would you be like you know what this is my hold on would you be like this is my child and I&amp;#39;m going to love who my child loves or what would you say um I would say no because even though I well just I know how my family is like I have an if you pass a certain way requirement he won&amp;#39;t even allow you to sell on her account so that&amp;#39;s how like my family members somebody like that yeah yeah she was she&amp;#39;ll be very directly and tell you that yeah but um I would tell my son I raised you better than that you need to get a second job this is not okay she obviously has a lot of mental issues she&amp;#39;s dealing with so why would you abuse her financially because of that because that&amp;#39;s the only thing it could be and secondly for genetic purposes like I don&amp;#39;t want my my my you want to give your kids a Fighting Chance you don&amp;#39;t want to have them born with all these type of pre-diabetes or whatever else that she got going on in her family history obviously along with the mental health issues because you don&amp;#39;t get that big loving yourself I mean and I just want to add and I&amp;#39;m speaking from experience couches have weight limits okay so I when I first got my first problem I thought I could get them little cheap couches no you got to get a good couch you gotta make sure you reading them I&amp;#39;ve never had that problem no no no they do have and problem thank God no hold on my aunt but my aunt she she&amp;#39;s the one I get it from like I to change my kids especially as little kids that to change their Furniture every six months every year my aunt changeed her furniture out and she gets nothing but the best she love that Italian furniture so yeah my aunt do not play and there no plastic on it so if she smell you and you skinny she ain&amp;#39;t gonna let you sit on her accounts either and she will tell you why she just that type of way I don&amp;#39;t know my family be very direct like you bring them to you bring them around the family they oh some of them G let you sit on the couch but they hold on get a board get a board you know W be like they real like that&amp;#39;s how we we we real roastes in my family so that&amp;#39;s how I know how to drag cuz baby we are some real roers but let me bring It full circle so my thing is the reason why I asked that question to you guys is I just found it so interesting like listening to bana try to brag on how her boyfriend mother loves her and it just brings me into like the delusion of obesity because it&amp;#39;s like you know I mean I&amp;#39;m not the skinniest person in the world but I&amp;#39;m definitely not a fat [ __ ] so it&amp;#39;s like when I&amp;#39;m listening to this I&amp;#39;m like yo none of my brothers dare they would anyway my brothers are attractive so that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s never been a problem problem for them but you know overweight women that just can&amp;#39;t happen like is just sick so bana&amp;#39;s over there trying to brag about the mama and you know what that told me she is giving wait don&amp;#39;t your brother date white women I have a little brother who&amp;#39;s married to a white woman but I have an older brother who&amp;#39;s married to a black woman and my older brother is the one that has my son but the white woman who my little brother is married to is dynamic she is one of the she is one of the most amazing people that I&amp;#39;ve met in my life that girl know how to do everything she know how to braid she know how to cook she and she&amp;#39;s Air Force too so they&amp;#39;re very like they the way they run their house is like Air Force type [ __ ] and I mean I&amp;#39;m just totally against my kids not looking like me no no that&amp;#39;s fine and that&amp;#39;s fine that&amp;#39;s fine you know how you feel up could never bother me because that&amp;#39;s you you know that&amp;#39;s your life that show you know I&amp;#39;m not I&amp;#39;m not mad at that but at the same time I love both of my sisters-in-laws I&amp;#39;m blessed to have a sister-in-law that is black who is raising my son with my brother and my brother my brother my sister-in-law and my son they are we&amp;#39;re all connected we all have a group chat I mean my son sends me his report card every week because they get like progress reports every week and yes I spoil my son because my brother makes it easy for me to do that I just brought my son some airpods that I need baby I need them but I sent it I will spoil my kid because at the end of the day my my my brother makes it easy for me to do that speaking of which you know that you bought me not my daughter got it your little Hai my little Haitian daughter got it oh good no yeah that&amp;#39;s good trust me and she will love it but my thing is and that&amp;#39;s my thing like I I feel blessed like at the end of the day when people be talking that [ __ ] it is what it is I get it this what the be that gives whatever but I know that I&amp;#39;m blessed you know I&amp;#39;m very blessed my son got a better phone than me right now and that&amp;#39;s how it should be that&amp;#39;s how it should be because at the I&amp;#39;m sorry no I&amp;#39;m just saying at the end of the day he ain&amp;#39;t with me and the mere fact that that&amp;#39;s the case I have just I I have no what what what do you expect from me you know like like what am I supposed to do not give him what he wants please I&amp;#39;m gonna give him what he wants as long as he does what he&amp;#39;s supposed to do so you got a good you got a good ass brother and sister-in-law shout out to them I agree with that but got a great sister-in-law and she does nails and she does them like if you want she her acrylic nails she&amp;#39;s an artist as well and her acrylic nails are they will last you at least a month two months before you have to take them [ __ ] off so she&amp;#39;s an artist but before I like if you guys want some matter of fact she&amp;#39;s sending me some and I&amp;#39;ll show y&amp;#39;all but yeah oh yeah I love to see black you know black woman be the best of everything they do but I don&amp;#39;t n is given a hypothetical situation but in most cases that&amp;#39;s why computer back is so desperate no man wants a woman that big but I think female facts brought up a great point at the end of the day though if your kid brings home somebody that you don&amp;#39;t necessarily like the best thing to do is not push push back too much you know you can say your reservations in a nice way because I had to learn that with my son because I don&amp;#39;t know why he doesn&amp;#39;t understand Spanish is damn near White so no you know what I&amp;#39;m saying but instead of me going through all that with I learn to be like okay if he has a Spanish girlfriend I&amp;#39;m not making her vday basket but if he has a black girlfriend I will make her one I will make sure he has money to take her on dates if it&amp;#39;s a Spanish or anything else he got to get it out the mud so up I feel like you know I feel like that&amp;#39;s a little [ __ ] up because you know at the end of the day you know with these younger kids that are growing up these days you just got to like kind of listen to what your son is telling you you know I&amp;#39;m not I&amp;#39;m not going to share that with y&amp;#39;all anyway you got to listen to what your son is telling you so it&amp;#39;s like if there&amp;#39;s a Spanish girl who your son is with that makes him feel great but then there&amp;#39;s a black girl who he likes but makes him feel bad are you saying that you will not absolutely not no my son is greatness and he deserved nothing but the best no but so but what I&amp;#39;m saying is so no because the thing is I am I am first of all my when I was with when I was dating men my my um preference was dark skin low haircut gotta have a nice body gotta be like you know that was my preference when I was dating men like I wanted a dark skinned man that is that was my that was my that had never changed my my type when I was [ __ ] with men was a dark [ __ ] with a low haircut who was tall and had like a nice physique a nice shape to him like like like that was to sixpacks you got to have a sixpack I feel you I feel you because B like yeah yeah so anyway that was my type so it&amp;#39;s like you know I feel where you&amp;#39;re coming from but all I&amp;#39;m saying is like you know if wouldn&amp;#39;t you want to you know um pour into to what makes your son most happier and not what you feel that but let me tell no let me tell you this but if my daughter wanted to date out her race I would not have a problem because black women if there&amp;#39;s so why you trying to copy pizaro&amp;#39;s uh theory listen to probably girl she probably copied me because I&amp;#39;ve been saying this for years so she I don&amp;#39;t listen to that ho so she probably is really going off with stilling my token points now that I&amp;#39;m not going to hit the link and correct her ass I don&amp;#39;t even watch you see she&amp;#39;s even copying in my kids meal well my daughter Old Mill she&amp;#39;s no longer a pescatarian but whatever now she claiming her kids don&amp;#39;t eat meat that girl all she that&amp;#39;s another one that be cop like just leave me in my swag alone between her and lemon I can&amp;#39;t live but anyway I&amp;#39;ve been saying this for years I can I can pull up videos from the black women sector I was talking about have discussions on panels the reason why I say it&amp;#39;s okay for my my daughter is because she doesn&amp;#39;t have that many options when it come when black men get a little couple dollars in their pocket all of a sudden they got all these different requirements for black women versus women of other races meanwhile with men it&amp;#39;s a society thing they push a certain look in agenda and and and and way to be and basically try to make it seem like black women at the bottom but black women have been holding their Community down all these things that they complain about usually happen with women&amp;#39;s other races and no matter where black men go they have the same problem you see what I&amp;#39;m saying so it&amp;#39;s a difference no I don&amp;#39;t see what you&amp;#39;re saying because what if the black girl that your son is interested or or in or whatever has the same black mama as the black dude that your daughter is interested in that you have an issue with then what I&amp;#39;m sorry repeat that again so what if the same girl that your son is interested in who&amp;#39;s black right right and again I&amp;#39;m just trying to make sense of what you&amp;#39;re saying so if the same girl who your son is interested in who is black but you want to pour into that per that situation because it&amp;#39;s a black girl even though the black girl may make your son feel some kind of way like should make him feel some kind of way but because she&amp;#39;s black you want to pour into that situation but then the same dudes that you&amp;#39;re talking about with society and all that got the same mom as the same black girl and this dude is interested in your daughter how would you leverage that like what would you do then wouldn&amp;#39;t you want to just pull them both out of the situation because the thing is like you I feel like it&amp;#39;s selfish you know let me tell you something when I when I did have my son I was selfish and let me tell you how I was selfish I when I would go out to eat when I would go out to McDonald&amp;#39;s whatever I would order him food the way I ate food so if I ordered like let&amp;#39;s say let me make it some let&amp;#39;s say was getting a burger I don&amp;#39;t like mustard I don&amp;#39;t like pickles I don&amp;#39;t like none of that [ __ ] so I will order my burger ketchup onions whatever and when I will order his Burger I will order it like mine CU mind you maybe he was like three at the time four at the time but I&amp;#39;m ordering it like mine because that&amp;#39;s my son and I&amp;#39;m thinking like you know he&amp;#39;s not gonna like what I he&amp;#39;s not gonna like what I don&amp;#39;t like today that [ __ ] love him some mustard today he love him some pickles and it&amp;#39;s just like it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s why I was saying like I feel like you know you&amp;#39;re only thinking about yourself when you say [ __ ] like that because like I get how I could come across a selfish but at the end of the day I&amp;#39;m not going around picking his girlfriend he pick who he pick like these are they don&amp;#39;t know that I like to do the um Valentine DIY so they&amp;#39;re not missing out on something that they don&amp;#39;t know about and neither is he he be picking it up late sometime but like it doesn&amp;#39;t bother him but it&amp;#39;s not to say like oh if he go out and marry a Puerto Rican or or have a child with a white girl I&amp;#39;m just gonna cut him and child off no that&amp;#39;s not what I&amp;#39;m saying it it becomes a different situation but I I&amp;#39;m not arguing with but that&amp;#39;s not something I want I&amp;#39;m not I&amp;#39;m that&amp;#39;s just my way of protesting against I&amp;#39;m not gonna withhold anything from my son it&amp;#39;s just like he&amp;#39; be like Oh I&amp;#39;m going to go see my girlfriend I like oh hey son come take that but the type of person my son is he really don&amp;#39;t like taking um like he likes to get it on his own put it like that anyway he&amp;#39;s like that anyway but I&amp;#39;m just saying like when he was younger and couldn&amp;#39;t do that that&amp;#39;s what I would prefer to do but of course I&amp;#39;m G get but if it was like somebody that I would picture him with of course I&amp;#39;m G do a little bit extra yeah but I just feel like I know where that leads and there a lot of these um nonblack women that are attracted to black men is usually for a nefarious reason and I already know my son&amp;#39;s greatness and I don&amp;#39;t want him to be out here looking bad as these other [ __ ] that give their wealth over to other communities it&amp;#39;s just deeper with me and I feel like he should know better no okay and that&amp;#39;s fair like you know I that that that&amp;#39;s fair I was just wondering I was just curious so you know I&amp;#39;m not going to make a big deal out of it but um let me see so has there been anything that you saw today that you want to comment on um do you have a comment about me in this Heats live this [ __ ] with treasure Lane Jay Wilson um any of those things I just want y to know that&amp;#39;s somebody my that&amp;#39;s somebody outside my window nobody&amp;#39;s nothing&amp;#39;s going on in my house because you weirdos like to blame everything on me oh you can&amp;#39;t hear it good I I could hear it I don&amp;#39;t know sound like somebody arguing outside the window but um my think I like I said I think I thought today was great but I feel like comped back maybe she Cent or maybe sou or poty C or maybe she just did that trying to be trying to get cookie points cuz you know they be kicking her back and and you know they think by ATT up so I just want you I just want South P to know had she not brought Nala in computer back would have got embarrassed because y&amp;#39;all heard me earlier I said I was gon I was like let me go up there and do juicy off camera because I was thinking that first should I do computer back but I was like no I&amp;#39;mma leave that ho alone but no s patch had to come up there and you are nobody I don&amp;#39;t know nothing except that you be going around kissing ass so I said oh I know how to get this ho I already told her every y send with Y gopies I&amp;#39;m embarrass the [ __ ] out of y&amp;#39;all so I enjoyed that part of it what if I would have won that have been sweet because that have been like lady Nas because I wasn&amp;#39;t even planning to be in that [ __ ] but you know it is what it is the person that won did a great job yeah and that really did a good job but you you you didn&amp;#39;t even answer anything that I asked you up oh yeah oh female facts I um my son is by American black man yes that&amp;#39;s the only American or full American black child I have um my daughter&amp;#39;s hat dad is Haan all of that y know Jamaica but my son my son dad is from Harlem like me that&amp;#39;s how I know um Cameron&amp;#39;s bodyguard but I saw you I did his bodyguard he should try to talk to me but he was fat his name is fat Sean heed to flirt in front of my son dad face like that&amp;#39;s another reason why I know I would never ever be with him long ter uhuh [ __ ] I de with they shut [ __ ] down that&amp;#39;s why I like them rude ass Jamaica men they don&amp;#39;t play them games but um anyway you and he I can tell you this N I was shocked I didn&amp;#39;t expect really yeah I didn&amp;#39;t I really did and I was like what the hell at first I thought she was actually on Jay D live but then I listened more and I realized it was a old I saw you in the chat and I had felt some kind of way for a second cuz she was like is that my he and I&amp;#39;m thinking to myself girl you don&amp;#39;t know this is old like you doing too much that&amp;#39;s all thinking to myself like this is too like this is old like stop yeah but I I came in the middle of the live so I didn&amp;#39;t know I just heard talking and I then when I saw I was listening I was like oh this is old and I was I just left I like oh J on her [ __ ] but I didn&amp;#39;t think he would come respond to way so when I seen she respond and I was laughing when she was talking about you know um James or whatever the case may be I just thought it was funny so will he be coming back anytime soon or was that was just like a one time yeah that was a one and done just respond and and and move on that&amp;#39;s not like yeah was a win and then and did who did you think should win the contest the impersonation contest yes I mean I will say I feel like everybody did good but I&amp;#39;m I&amp;#39;m happy with the winner you know um yeah I am happy with the winner um and bur and dead you know again to win she did go in I I I really like the Dragon kit that was that was accurate as well yeah and then like camera does help but then like there is a capability to win off camera too so people that were off camera were great you know they were still great but I think the element of her being able to be on camera and have props and all that other stuff that is what really made her win you know and on a scale of one to 10 how mad you think juy gonna be the Mad tomorrow I don&amp;#39;t think he&amp;#39;s going to be mad at all um I don&amp;#39;t think that this was a live that would upset him um um yeah yeah oh Reed did good too I like how she did the DI did a great job too copy her too came up there copying her too but go ahead who boo he was doing a dialogue too after Reed did it but my yeah and but Reed is an example of what I mean about like being off camera and still doing like a good job because did yeah you don&amp;#39;t have to always be on camera you could still give but again because am that had like all those props and especially when she was doing my skit that [ __ ] just like I was watching it but like before I could laugh at it I was like do I really be looking like that yes you do I surprised you was acting sh you be having a camera right in the middle of your leg I&amp;#39;m like I don&amp;#39;t like I feel like what I do is I give you guys a full Ensemble like a lot of people don&amp;#39;t do and I feel like I just give y&amp;#39;all an ensemble I don&amp;#39;t I don&amp;#39;t be thinking like I&amp;#39;m trying to like put it like directly at my legs to give y&amp;#39;all my legs like that&amp;#39;s something what I would be thinking so it was interesting it was interesting to see how she portray me because it made me think to myself okay well maybe I have to tone it down a bit you

up on lady Snoop you know that&amp;#39;s [ __ ] up that&amp;#39;s [ __ ] up the beef sector I think the lies were different I think I had an interview and I feel like sir King I kind of pulled up at the last minute um me pulling at the it was like I&amp;#39;m not saying like I can reflect his numbers which I would never do so or take accountable oh oh people on here because of me I don&amp;#39;t feel that way uh I pulled up at the last minute when I drop down from n battle um but I knew since my name was in the title and I felt the way towards him I&amp;#39;m like let me tell you how I feel since you had haven&amp;#39;t reached out to me as a friend let me tell you how I feel hit the Le and go from there man I could count but I I didn&amp;#39;t hold back I didn&amp;#39;t hold back I don&amp;#39;t feel like he held back either I go over count I bet you was more than 10 but I understand this is one thing I want to say he don&amp;#39;t don&amp;#39;t overt talk me my bro uh I got it out my body and I feel better I feel like now he kind of knows where I feel like where we stand um to me I just hate a one-sided friendship and a lot of y&amp;#39;all always like sir King is your guy sir King is your you know I I wouldn&amp;#39;t know you you know and that&amp;#39;s true you wouldn&amp;#39;t know me without sir King but when I brought up my points I landed my plane he didn&amp;#39;t have much to say back because it&amp;#39;s truth it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s in putting and even though after that live just happened on his channel I did call him he didn&amp;#39;t answer which uh I was not suspecting him to answer but I was like okay if he&amp;#39;s truly my friend he will answer this call because I&amp;#39;m going to be very honest I still going to be very honest and very transparent with him but I know once his life ended and I tried to call him and he didn&amp;#39;t answer I was like okay same [ __ ] same [ __ ] okay noted I&amp;#39;m good but I think

even saying her name right now is just like all right but but no one came on bad thing because it doesn&amp;#39;t make a difference once you hit rock bottom um Trump could say your name it ain&amp;#39;t gonna do [ __ ] for you she she turned on you for no she turned on you for no reason too yeah she did she really did she no she turned on me because everybody else was and that&amp;#39;s

a spirit then to to pull people in who who are being attacked I didn&amp;#39;t know none of the history that&amp;#39;s been about three and a half years ago and then you disappeared and you know what we did n we prayed for you we I would say where where&amp;#39;s that that lady at where where the little NES go um people would pick on you about that lip well do you want me to make a confession my

big lip or or this or that never ever did it because the the truth of the matter is is that we all have somebody in our life and it would be stupid for me to pick on you about something that the W the woman in my life had it it just didn&amp;#39;t make any sense I never looked at it as anything other than a part of you you know reminded me of somebody that I love let me finish be I gotta go she closing down so I want to say this yeah I&amp;#39;ve attacked you and you&amp;#39;ve protected me and we went back and forth but I never called you ugly because I don&amp;#39;t think you&amp;#39;re ugly I think you&amp;#39;re an attractive woman I&amp;#39;ve always said that you call just let let it go can you let me finish finish what the [ __ ] I&amp;#39;m trying to arum again let listen let me tell y something the lip Shi for me only exists on YouTube I never have to deal with people asking me question about my lip in real life so it&amp;#39;s fine I&amp;#39;m really I&amp;#39;m trying to highlight the I&amp;#39;m trying to highlight the things that you only you can take notice of because you know it to be true it&amp;#39;s for nobody else in this room but you and if you still talk to nbk if you I don&amp;#39;t know what your relationship is but we would discuss you we would discuss you oh yeah yeah she could get it she a pretty chocolate girl you understand never put you in that classification of a mud duck think that you would ever because of your think so I I I don&amp;#39;t know I don&amp;#39;t know let me ask you like your history with nbk do you think that you could ever just at least in the very least apologize for the things that you have said and done when it came to him and his family you know what mess I don&amp;#39;t think you know and I you know he knows he knows because I now I&amp;#39;m gonna share something with you he held back he held back on NPK he could have called nbk&amp;#39;s wife in the middle of let me let me finish let me finish there are some things that you don&amp;#39;t know that nbk knows and I let him know and he can confirm this with you all right and at one point when we were going back and forth and and it was heated I let him know there&amp;#39;s a line I just can&amp;#39;t cross all right and then I stopped now you can ask him about that I&amp;#39;m not GNA go into details but he can tell you that was the last text

point is is this is that you didn&amp;#39;t know that you didn&amp;#39;t know that did you NES but he knows that yeah so when you talk I&amp;#39;m let me just say this time heals all wounds and you never know what the future will hold but if everything is cool if everything is cool and calm you you sometimes if that&amp;#39;s all you can get you accept that and you don&amp;#39;t you know you don&amp;#39;t pull a scab off of a womb you let it wash off and only only way to wash things off is over a period of time I don&amp;#39;t know what the future will hold you dig but I can tell you that one little part that only he knows and I know and you didn&amp;#39;t know that and that&amp;#39;s when it stopped can you dig it it was a certain point at the height of of the back and forth that I said yeah I can&amp;#39;t go no further than that and I let it go because people can be vicious and at the end of the day do I think he he a thorough dude yeah he thorough I got I mean there&amp;#39;s

    "transcript": "good morning good afternoon and good evening welcome to 10650 day of continuous and start today&amp;#39;s program with a silent prayer for minute thank you and welcome back today we have with us Dr man duat BHMs MSC psych psychology CCH Chief physician VD homeo Clinic Kim nagar telingana District India and the topic is homeopathic strategies in headache and migraine you all know that the relevance of this Pro problem migraine I think almost 15% of the population all over the world is suffering from this disease so we welcome man you can have platform for the next 45 minutes so please proceed yes thank you sir good evening everyone and good evening to all and first of all I thanks to iph who has given this platform to share my views on homeopathic strategies in headaches thank you thank you sir we&amp;#39;ll proceed the class and good evening to one and all and sir and especially very much thanks to this team of iph international forum for promoting Homeopathy for giving this wonderful opportunity to share my views on headaches and migraines as well and is my voice is clear to everyone is it Audible and a yes thank you sir so before going into this session the first warning I should give to all homeopaths is prescribe until and unless indicated with the totality of symptoms so this is the main theme we are going to uh have this session moreover so coming into what is a headache actually so a simple definition about headache is headache is a pain in any region of the head and headache may occur on one or both theid sides of head both the sides of head be isolated to a certain location and radiate across the head from one point or on wise like quality so these headaches can be at one-sided both sided different wandering pains and this headache may appear the sharp pain throbbing sensation or a dull pain so headaches can be developed gradually or suddenly and may last for less than an hour or for several days it can be an acute phase or it can be a chronic phase as well so coming into the types of headaches headaches are of primary and secondary as well so in primary it is divided into it is D to tension headaches stucture headaches migraine and migraine with aura coming into secondary headaches medication overuse of medicines which are aggravated from some English medicines Etc and sinusitis and spinal issues with thunder clap these are the secondary types of headaches here so for now we are discussing about headaches and we as a homeopath won&amp;#39;t won&amp;#39;t be treating the disease but we treat the person as a whole so this is our main scenario of understanding the remedies as well so coming into the homeopathic pattern I&amp;#39;ll directly enter into the homeopathic pattern as well so how we can prescribe remedy what are the confirmatory symptoms of each remedy and what is the causation for headaches if the headache is there how we can confirm so and so remedies right so coming to the cause of headache so there is there is two causes one is psychos omatic cause the other one is physical causes now we&amp;#39;ll discuss about psychosomatic headaches and the psychosomatic cause right so first rubric of today&amp;#39;s session and with a psychosomatic headaches the rubric is mind Joy heada from Joy so whenever they go into the state of Joyful whenever they go into the state of pleasure whenever they go into the state of entertainment or any surprises then they go into the state of headaches then the somatic derangement occurs so the remedies in this rubric are cofia Cruda crocus sativas cycline opium pulsatilla and scrota now in front of you you have a patient and you have took the rubric that is after Joy they develop they the complaints of headache now these are some remedies now the main physician aim is to prescribe only single remedy classical prescription that we need to understand if you want to prescribe a single remedy for patient we need to have enough knowledge of metromed on each and every remedy and their confirmatory symptoms so we&amp;#39;ll discuss in this pattern of learning rubrics with the remedies and how to prescribe and what to prescribe and when to prescribe that is our main aim of this session so coming into cofia had a state of elements from pleasant surprises we all know coffia has the pleasant surprise elements from a lot of sudden emotions surprises elements from bad effects from surprises coffee sa remedy with lot of emotion fear and fright you can see in this remedy and especially cofia is such a remedy for sleeplessness insomnia you can see in this remedy with lot of over sens Tess of all senses like Hippa like chamoma like beladona and opium and if you open Kent reper single remedy kindness for lot of kindness and cofia has a state of benevolence you can see so in such states of coffia crura is wonderful remedy you can prescribe there so coming into crocus a crocusa is a more of hemorragic remedy when they have the hemorrhagic Tendencies more of lacis like Tendencies lot of black is hemorragic discharges with lot of historical remedy historical with hemorrhagic diis crocus is your remedy along with the headache if they have complaints of headache and next coming to cyclan here in this rubric in cyclan they have prolonged migraines this is the symptom which was F sir has written in his metrom Med prolonged migraines especially of one-sided headaches cycline is your remedy and now how we can confirm a cycline patient in your clinic so cycline is very very very very close to pulsatilla understand if a patient is of pulsatilla kind of Nature and interestingly cyclin is a remedy that comes very close to Pulsa and it calls us chili pulsatilla everything is very very close to Pulsa but in cycline it is aversion to open air in pulsatilla it is more of mild nature yielding but in cycl it is more of irritability that is major difference of pulsatilla and cycline you need to understand and cycline is also one such a remedy you can prescribe in soreness of heel pains and it do wonders when it is indicated remember the remedy cyclan so coming into the next scutal area so this is one such a remedy where the it has written from boric meter directly it states that explosive headaches of school teachers especially explosive headache of school teachers with a lot of frequent urination is a concomitant symptom of scutaria and these patients have lot of nervous fears lot of nervous fears lot of nervous tendency you can see in this remedy scutal area and this is also one such a remedy you can prescribe at climat trics when they have the headache complaints coming into opium we all know opium elements from Fright fear remaining fear of extravagance is one of the key confirmatory of opium remedy and lot of sleeplessness you can see in this remedy and along with that some key symptoms for headache is vertigo after fright vertigo especially in old people generally we prescribe conium right so it is AB all that opium and with lot of paralysis of brain it is comes very close to brain fake like zinum so these are some remedies of the rubric from the rubric mind Joy headache from Joy so coming into the next remedy of the psychosomatic headaches our next prominent rubric is head pain relaxing from mental exertion this is a beautiful beautiful pqs or what we can say haniman according to haniman that is 153 aphorism see this head pain when they start relaxing head pain when they are at rest the single remedy is Iris versic now we&amp;#39;ll discuss about some important symptoms of Iris vular here a lot of sick headaches you can see with this remedy and the concomitant of diarrhea frontal headaches with lot of nausea and vomiting they go into the state of depression sadness with headaches and profuse clear urine with headaches and other key symptom of these Iris versic headache is recurrent skin headache sick headaches with constipation if you get a patient

    "transcript": "and answer segment so when we talking about pain pain is interesting and what yes yes what came to my mind is the fact that in the Book of Revelation the last book of the Bible chapter 21 it says that God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes and there shall be no more pain and if God has to remove pain it means that pain started somewhere um because of the sin problem but people today live with pain and they think that there is nothing that can be done and that may not necessarily be so so let&amp;#39;s B ahead close our eyes and see what we could learn from pain today Father we thank you that you are so good to us you are awesome you are the Healer of the Wounded the mender of the broken and so for those in pain today may they find relief in Jesus name amen so pain definitely is a problem but pain really is not a problem it is a problem but it is not a problem if I were to tell someone in pain hey you don&amp;#39;t have a problem they may not believe me but truth be told pain is an indicator so we look at what pain really is because we find a lot of people are in pain about 54 million Americans have arthritis 30% of all Americans have back problems um over three ,000 children have arthritis and 2third of those people um are actually adults of working age so lots of people are living with pain of at some level we have grown so accustomed to that which is unnatural pain is not natural to health what about headaches this is a big one every day 15% of the people in the world have a headache could you imagine that we have over 8 billion people 15% of that um estimates are that at least 90% of the population has at least one headache a year this is high really really high um about one out of six persons suffer from chronic headaches 5% of all adults have a headache almost daily matter of fact life seem to be a headache now the thing is headaches are not necessarily life threatening but they can affect and impact people&amp;#39;s output and their performance and they are actually the number one reason children miss school and that accounts for about 127 million days of missed working adults so pain is a present reality in our lives and it creates problems whether it be pain in the foot pain in the leg pain in the knees pain in the head this is just the headaches to statistics people are living with pain now if you just go to headache just just looking at headaches alone there are different types of headaches you have tension headaches and this is the most common um type of headaches and accounts for about a quarter of all headaches the tension headache and then of course you have the migraine headaches migraines many people are suffering from migraines and then you have cluster headache sinus heada Hees hormonal headaches hypertensive headaches and the list goes on and on you can have many different types it is not the intention to go into all the types of headaches today but to just to let you know that we are having challenges with pain and headaches is a big one emotional issues may also be involved in headache so many people say this is giving me a headache you are giving me a headache so things like if you feel burdened you feel overwhelmed or weighed down this can contribute to your headache or this is a big one especially for Christians well number one and two overburdened and overwhelmed because you want to do so much for Jesus and um you know you are being overwhelmed because you&amp;#39;re not getting the support you see the path clearly but others have not seen the path and it&amp;#39;s difficult to bring them along then we have suppressing anger or not standing up for one El what does that mean you are saying yes when you really want to say no and that is actually being hypocritical or must be Y and must be n or carrying burdens you aren&amp;#39;t supposed to it is not your responsibility to save the world that&amp;#39;s God&amp;#39;s responsibility it is my responsibility to cooperate with him in the task that he has for me so if we address the emotional issues then a lot of times we can have relief from headaches not just a I would say maybe 99% of the times because there are other underlying causes sometimes as well that we may need to deal with I remember one situation where there was a a fellow medical missionary chronic migraine addict they were doing everything right but what was the issue emotional unresolved emotional issues and she did not need any kind of other intervention but for somebody to listen and to understand what she was going through um today many people are using the pain relievers a pain reliever and analgesic to relieve the pain but remember pain is an indicator that there is something wrong and if we mask the symptom then we would still have the problem the problem will exist now I know you may go to the doctor and the doctor May prescribe something because the doctor is there to bring relief to you the doctor doesn&amp;#39;t hait you the doctor just wants to bring relief because that&amp;#39;s what you want but many people are not asking the question why are these things so pain actually is a signal it&amp;#39;s like a language Just Like Music or the way we use words the body cannot speak in words so it is going to speak in signals we call them signs and symptoms but it&amp;#39;s the body&amp;#39;s way of speaking it is going to signal that there is some damage that is happening and usually that damage is part of the in body&amp;#39;s natural response called inflammation inflammation is the body&amp;#39;s initial response to infection irritation or tissue damage infection irritation tissue damage in vascularized tissue so it&amp;#39;s is going to it&amp;#39;s like a notification the body is saying hey you need to pay attention here so the body is going to notify us that it is damaged so that we can take action think of it this way if we did not feel pain we would not even know that there is an injury we would not even know that something wrong so pain really is a teacher Whenever there is damage to the body the body is going to initiate as part of its immune response some situations that create symptoms of heat swelling redness and pain and wherever you hear itis itis anything itis is inflammation of inflammation so if you hear sinusitis or arthritis or laringitis inflammation and these are the classic symptoms heat swelling redness and pain you may wonder why we have these symptoms number one whenever an area is injured the body is going to concentrate the forces to try to fix the problem um and that those those tools are going to be brought by the blood and so you&amp;#39;re going to have more activity increase blood flow increase the temperature temperature is also increased because maccrage activity is going to increase so that you can destroy whatever organism that have to potential to create problems in the body swelling again fluid is going to be concentrated in that area because through injury we have a damage to blood vessels and um the plasma proteins leak out into the surrounding tissue spaces redness again more blood more blood means more activity more immune factors more healing virtue and of course as things swell in the area it press against nerves and you feel pain so pain is telling us there is something that is wrong um muscles and joint pain tend to involve chronic inflammation which is long-term not acute and we&amp;#39;re going to distinguish between acute and chronic because chronic pain is different chronic pain is usually an indication of stagnation you&amp;#39;re feeling pain all the time stagnation means things are moving pretty slow that means healing is not taking place so now unlike the inflammation with acute injury the process is not ending and usually in chronic inflammation is a systemic thing not a localized thing if you smash your toe or your finger that process is acute but if you&amp;#39;re feeling pain in your knees and your hands um and your neck 3 4 5 6 10 20 2 years then we have a problem so this is the distinction between what we call acute and chronic inflammation because many for for most people a pain is a pain is a pain is a pain but that&amp;#39;s not really so um as we said the acute inflammation isn&amp;#39;t inflammatory response is natural you smash your finger you smash your toe now the injury can actually be chemical or biological or mechanical in other words the Smashing of the toe is mechanical or let us say um biological an agent bacteria fungi viruses parasite or it can be chemical there are changes in or chemistry that can contribute to those things so for example um people are under stress you produce a lot of cortisol and cortisol while it&amp;#39;s anti-inflammatory in the long term it can create other problems of course of part of the immune response for um and that can be acute or chronic so in autoimmune disorders it&amp;#39;s a little different as opposed to for example osteoarthritis as opposed to rheumatoid arthritis yeah um usually this um inflammation is accompanied with pain and that is going to cause us to rest avoid moving the injured tissue so that we can heal so the pain is the body&amp;#39;s response to Aid the healing but usually we don&amp;#39;t know how to listen to the body so we want to work to make ends meet we want to handle our business so we go on um chronic inflammation is usually due to Chronic toxicity lack of nutrients stress and those things damage tissues because the movement of lymphatic fluid is important for health uptake of oxygen nutrients and removal of waste Whenever there is a slowing of the movement of this lymphatic fluid we are going to have issues of chronic inflammation usually that is more difficult to determine because the damage it causes is more Insidious you know it is unhealthy and it causes us not to address the damage we want to just get rid of the symptom and the thing with chronic inflammation is that it can become degenerative tissu start to deteriorate painkillers would not solve the problem if you have um H pylori that is creating a problem in your tissue then you know taking a in Kil of the problem usually the pain in chronic inflammation is a dull pain that is very uncomfortable as opposed to a sharp pain in the acute situation the emotions are very important as well emotional pain is also a sign of injury uh um but not necessarily injury to ourselves because we can hurt if we&amp;#39;ve lost something or lost someone but we can suffer because of the law of harvest which is whatsoever a man sow that shall he also reap so sometimes the pain we feel for example I may have lived a careless life in my youth so now I have met Jesus and things have changed guess what I may feel the pain some of my actions still have consequences yeah all negative energy and hurt we put out to others is going to return to us multiplied so many people may not understand whatever you s you&amp;#39;re going to reap our emotions then will tell us the type of seeds that we are sewing so if you find that you&amp;#39;re having a lot of pain sometimes especially with other people what are you sewing actions sewn in Anger grief and fear or hatred reap the same emotions in our own life so whatever I S remember think of it this way the law of harvest I S one seed one seed one tomato seed and guess what I have a tree of hundreds of tomatoes so whatever I put out is going to return to me multiplied so that can be very painful so when we do something that isn&amp;#39;t good for the body we experience pain and when we do something good then we experience pleasure so we have the Pleasure and Pain being teachers so if I&amp;#39;m feeling pain I should try to learn what is happening thing is many people think pleasure is sinful but it is not it because if you want to experience real pleasure it can not be obtained from overindulgence even in something that may be good so when you over eat you may be happy eating what you like up to a certain time and then we experience discomfort so it is not pleasurable to overeat you cannot experience pleasure the folks who go and they party all night they have hangover they feel tired they get up feeling stupid we cannot experience pleasure from over Indulgence and so we need to read the body that is why God gave us uh signal s signal systems when I start to eat my body produces Grine when when I&amp;#39;m hungry when the stomach is closed and then as the stomach reaches a reasonable capacity I produce leptin the body saying hey it&amp;#39;s time to pause but I like the food so much so I eat more and then I become uncomfortable I can&amp;#39;t sleep I am in distress I want to vomit so that&amp;#39;s why God says in Galatians 5 the fruit of the spirit is temperance selfcontrol when we understand these things then we are going to ease a lot of pain children naturally follow their instincts they sto eating when they had enough but we train them to overeat we give them more animals don&amp;#39;t overeat generally they just eat until they&amp;#39;re satisfied so we probably need to learn from the animal world what are some of the root causes of pain then what what what what what how do we fix these causes because we need to remove the problem but if I don&amp;#39;t identify what the problem is then I can&amp;#39;t fix a problem that I do not know so really what we want to do is to if it&amp;#39;s a mechanical or chemical stressor we want to identify and remove that we want to reduce the inflammation by dealing with what created the injury in the first place with it&amp;#39;s emot or or physical uh circulation is important because it is the blood the life of the flesh is in the blood as the blood is able to cycle efficiently it brings healing virtue it brings oxygen it brings nutrients removes waste it brings the macras it brings the other components of the immune system so that healing can take place and of course nutrients nutrients are important for building tissue the life of the flesh is in the blood remember the blood brings the nut exp God is so awesome the blood is one of the most efficient transportation systems that that that we know about the blood it is able to transport so many things at the same time the uptake of oxygen and nutrients at the cell level is occurring at speeds of up to and over 80 times per second so if you have an itis know that there is hope for you today now mechanical irritation really be a problem and usually that is the result of ongoing stress to the muscles and the joints from poan muscle tension this is very important poor poan muscle tension is creating a lot of problems with people and they just simply ignore it um this is is is is is is a problem today because we are so accustomed to meet the ends and the needs and the goals of the economy we do it at the expense of our own health then the economy drives the kind of jobs that we have remember the economy is in conflict with our physiology I say it again the economy is in conflict with our physiology on many levels but remember in the economy the economy determines how we live and even think what is taught in the classroom is preached on the pulpit and believed in the Pew and this is affecting all of our lives so when we are operating in the economy we are not thinking necessarily well how does God want we are more thinking how to meet the ends of the economy for God had given his people a parallel economy but we have forgotten that and now we are integrated in an economy that is in conflict with our physiology repetitive movement not balanced by rest we work work work work work we work through lunch there&amp;#39;s a reason there&amp;#39;s a lunch time there&amp;#39;s a break time um then in doing all of this work without rest we don&amp;#39;t put in nutrients remember nutrients builds tissues so osteoarthritis back pain and mechanical pain is usually due to Mechanical iritation we are just stressing our bodies too much and when we stress the body the body is going to respond um ostearthritis over 27 million people we have in this situation the joint is deteriorating um and there may be several causes for that it may be hormonal especially for women who are into menopause or it may be um pH issues um pH isues can create a problem in that whenever the body is overly acidic whether it&amp;#39;s from acidic thoughts acidic lifestyle acidic diet guess what the body does it pulls nutrients to balance to pull your calcium to balance this is important for the rebuilding of your joints um or the keeping of your joints the cillage so for many people uh adverse childhood experiences we call them a have created patterns of thinking that we have to protect ourselves and we have to look out for number one as we are stressed like that we are suspicious about everything the body is going to become acidic and it&amp;#39;s going to pull your calcium you know all um doc talk about that child who was a two imagine a child with a tck thank God he created camomile camomile is very effective for those ISU in children so here are some signs and symptoms of um this situation where we have the joint deterioration we have this um this pain that may be steady or alternating intermittent or there may be stiffness in the morning some people in the morning is stiff because you have been lying down all night and and so the the movement is not what it ought to be so it is a bit stiff in the morning as you go through the day and you moving circulation and other um um activities you&amp;#39;re going to have a ease in the pain because as the blood flows it&amp;#39;s bringing vert you to the area so it can you you don&amp;#39;t feel the pain that crunching feeling in the bone as the bone is rubbing on bone or there may be swelling or tenderness in the joint you see the cage is being damaged we we are fearfully and wonder ful made if you understand how God put these things in place then we are going to be so fascinated we say Lord you are great the thing is God wants to sanctify us we may say but how does sanctification come in in this we are threedimensional beings Body Mind and Spirit Body Soul spirit in first Thessalonians chapter 5 verse 23 says may the God of Peace sanctify you holy and May E I pray that your spirit and mind and body be preserved until the coming of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ God wants to sanctify us wholly not just our characters but our bodies as well we must take care of our bodies so that we can give it back as in glory to God so God wants to create in us not just clean hearts and right spirits but we healthy bodies going to help a healthy the mind to be healthier because what happens in the body affects the mind and the mind the body um good posture is very important because we are skeletal system our nervous system and all the muscles and so on they are working together so they are in a constant state of what you call Tone some are Contracting some are relaxing so any pull or push in one or the other direction can create problem so poor posture is going to create stress on the muscles of the back and the neck and the legs and the pelvis um we haven&amp;#39;t talked about even guilt and shame that can create problems there as well so you could also create stress on your joints because of repetitive movement um in the month of January I injured myself from poor lifting I was lifting something and you see nowadays this is how people are you you are we are just bending over hunched over on our devices and that creates problems um you increase when you are bending down by the law of gravity you are putting extra pressure by the weight of your head on your neck and your back and so on and then repetitive work so I was lifting something um and guess what um where I I did not use the correct technique and I damaged my vertebral area including my hip my um secr ilc joint was rotated to the left I couldn&amp;#39;t walk for a couple of weeks I had to go and get it remedied um three doctors I visited before I got a solution to the problem so if we disobey the laws that govern how we live whether physically mentally or spiritually we are going to rout the price so one of the things we want to do is to stretch periodically if we work at a desk or you know we work in high stress areas take a break the everything in nature rest there&amp;#39;s a rest between the beating of the heart in music there&amp;#39;s a rest we need to rest as well but for some people the the economy drives us so much we just work work work without rest so if you are behind the computer you want to stress in the opposite direction if you&amp;#39;re bending forward then you want to bend backward um periodically maybe once an hour or so take a couple of minutes and do that if you have excess weight then that can stress the muscles and the joints as well and it it it may increase the inflammation in the body and so if you lose some weight then that will help in relieving some of the mechanical stress on the body what we need is to be great grace to perate our lives not just to have Grace but we must also be graceful so a person who is socially gracious is able to move through social situations with without causing social friction or tension so if a person who is free from the burden of toxic guilt and shame and fear think about that they have peace and Harmony within themselves which allows them to move through life with emotional and spiritual Grace this is very very important tension in the mind is going to create tension in the body just like when we under stress we stimulate the HPA axis and the HP AIS is going to put the body in tension that tension doesn&amp;#39;t always only produce cortisol but it causes con contraction con constriction so the loss of innocence and Grace can lead to muscle tension poor posture you know that hunched over feeling that defeated feeling that some people have um think about it that they always feel defeating um and eventually that can create stress and pain structurally so your thoughts are important and that is why God tells us to Bear one another&amp;#39;s burden many people are bearing too many burdens the stresses of Life they don&amp;#39;t understand the promises of God and so we ought to help them to Bear their burdens to understand that one God Is A Healer my problem is not too big for my God many people think they feel so guilty when they this sin but remember the woman caught in adultery she was caught she did not come to God and what did he do did he stand and condemn her no he said woman I&amp;#39;m not condemning you all I want to do is to show you a better way to live so all this guilt and shame we try to hide is open before God anyway and he is the remedy to all of our problems so whenever a person is traumatized you see they freeze because you have freeze fight flight a lot of people in trauma they freeze and so it causes the muscles to tense and lock stress is going to do the same thing so you may think notice when you&amp;#39;re stressed you have issues with your neck and your shoulder and your back they feel tense whenever you feel overwhelmed and burdened and the question I would ask is who can you turn to yes we know we can turn to God but do you have a friend Do you have a someone who you could say got my back yeah so your legs May ache when you have problems moving forward in life and this is the emotional part we talking about and I have had situations like this to deal with I remember there was a client who they couldn&amp;#39;t work and as we did the assessment the emotional part there was a challenge there and so I shared with them how to overcome the challenge and they called me back about a month after for the first time in a long time they could walk because they couldn&amp;#39;t before so if you have there was another lady she had a cancer in her leg actually and there was nothing wrong with her physically but emotionally the assessment picked up the fact that she had a challenge and what was the challenge well she was living in the house with her mother-in-law and her husband was comfortable with that she wanted her own home she wasn&amp;#39;t moving she was stuck so she had a problem there so if you feet are hurting then that may be a signal that you don&amp;#39;t feel supported emotionally now remember to get the answer to these things you must do assessment but the the the the the the issue is most assessments do not take into account the emotion so we apply physical remedies and then when they don&amp;#39;t work we tell people um you&amp;#39;re not doing it right you&amp;#39;re not doing it enough when the problem may not be physical as at all if a person don&amp;#39;t feel supported what do they need do they need um Lilia Cayenne no that person need to get some support they need to get a body they need to have someone to support them so if you&amp;#39;re feeling ashamed of the way you acted you naturally are going to hang your head and tense your pelvis it&amp;#39;s like tucking your tail between your leg and when you do that is going to create pain because it&amp;#39;s in a natural position this is why we can lie with our words but we cannot lie with our bodies our bodies will always tell the truth we have to think to override these natural things and be specially trained to be able to do that so yes you can&amp;#39;t hide your stress from your body your body knows I can try to have a straight face but the body knows exactly what to do based on the situation that I&amp;#39;m facing so muscle pain and joint pain may be due to unresolved emotional trauma and stress that you may need to look into beyond the physical and when we have pain we can actually help us to think about life you know we can get in touch with our buried emotions with our hurts and then make the appropriate changes to the way we think and live and this is the problem how am I thinking because the events in life sh my thoughts the events in my life are going to shape my thoughts my thoughts are going to shape my feelings and my thoughts and feelings combined make up my moral character and this is the Cascade now and it&amp;#39;s from that thought and feeling combined that I&amp;#39;m going to make decisions and each choice I make it has a result a law of sewing and reaping the law of harvest we call it whatever I put out is going to return to me multiply Al therefore it&amp;#39;s important to put the emotions in perspective really when we look at the cause of disease there are only four causes of disease number one is mental and emotional stress and if you do the research you&amp;#39;ll see mental emotional stress is number one yet it&amp;#39;s the thing that the least attention is paid to the next one is nutritional deficiencies we spend time on that and then we have toxins whether it be from self or from the environment or other um other causes and then we have physical trauma so we cannot understand the physical trauma if I bump into something something bump into me whatever I get knocked something physical trauma well understood nutritional deficiencies you know more or less because we start to get into chronic pain and then we have the toxicity now but the emotions because the emotions can&amp;#39;t be seen and we feel V vable when we try when we allow people to get into emotions but remember emotions are 90% of what we do 90% of what we do is because of our emotions so it would be wise for us to look into them and fix them so pain can help us to get in touch with our emotions and how we could change them and change our lives so here are some plants that can Aid in our having Grace we have the Willow Willow is a very bendable it&amp;#39;s easily bendable and joints are supposed to bend and long ago long time it has been long used to e arthritis um it has been used to help people to let go of the past and to forgive God put the components in there he says the plants in um in Psalm 114 he causeth the grass to grow for the kettle and herbs for the service of man so if you find yourself being inflexible God designed the willow which is a very flexible plant dog wood um Jamaican Dog Wood very um special plant I love Jamaica because there are so many medicinal plants there I was telling a friend of mine recently nobody in Jamaica should be sick I&amp;#39;ve never seen so many medicinal plants concentrated in a place but people don&amp;#39;t know them um I actually found a plant in Jamaica they call it donkey peee it is actually shaped like a little bottle and it&amp;#39;s filled with a liquid to wash your eyes and use it for AR ey and these things it actually shaped like a bottle I&amp;#39;ve never seen that plant anyway when I saw it I I asked what is this and you go online and you can research it and all the big uh there&amp;#39;s some big like petals on it that look like little genie bottles and in those bottles are filled with liquid isn&amp;#39;t God awesome we could truly see how great thou art verine is an important nerving it helps intense heart driven people that&amp;#39;s emotionally helps them to relax and flow with greater ease I use actually I remember the first time I had an injury uh to my back I was in the evening and the only thing I could do is to make a ptis of I crush the leaves and put it up and help ease the pain um lavender and Lang Lang and these things are relaxing oils as well so now it&amp;#39;s important for us to have discernment so that we can help our mind our heart and our bodies what to them that call evil good and good evil that put light for darkness and darkness for light that put sweet for bitter and so on in other words God is saying to us that we are going to have a challenge when we move away from his design truth happiness and pleasure are from God falsehood suffering and pain are not from him God is about love and love is about attraction love is about attraction H hate is about repulsion and so whatever happens in our mind is going to affect our bodies as well now many people ask the question if God is so powerful then why does evil exist in the universe well we would never learn truth unless we see the evidence for ourselves um we would never understand and voluntarily come to God we will operate as robots and God is saying he is he&amp;#39;s going to give us free choice everything that happens to us is to help us and so God could say clearly in Romans all things work together for good to them that love the Lord all things are not good but they work together for good and this includes pain Hebrews 58 says though he were a son yet he learned obedience by the things which he suffered in other words it builds character I get to understand the issues and the controversy and now I could openly and I could clearly decide which side I&amp;#39;m going to stand on if you want gold what do you have to subject it to you have to subject it to high temperature like Reuben Ruben in the scripture in Genesis 49 his father Jacob said you are my firstborn my Excellency my might my strength but you shall not Excel you are as unstable as water water by the law of gravity pulls everything down destroys things in his part that&amp;#39;s what water does um water is going to take the shape of the container that you put it in it says you shall not Excel but Reuben is found among the Overcomers in Revelation chapter 7 he says now Reuben through the heat of trial because when you heat water the same water that is moving down by the law of gravity that water when heated is going to rise up to form vapor and so trials heat is The Crucible by which transformation can take place so we can learn from pain pain allows me to avoid certain things they are not good for me even though I may like them and so here is what um Christine mercy and sons of God said it was then that I understood pain suffering and heartbreak in their true light not as punishment sent by God but as a blessing isn&amp;#39;t that so here this listen to this I am pain most people hate me think me cruel call me heartless study ways to bribe and Fool Me Try by every means to slay me dope themselves with anesthetics fill themselves with patient patent nostrums call the one who practice medic seek the allopathic healer beat the Thum of the Savage build the altar burn the incense seek the S uh that wrath of the wrath of devils pray to Saints and gods and Angels not to cure the ills within them that&amp;#39;s the problem not to cleanse and purify them just to calm the pain that hurt them just to kill the guide that Wars them and that&amp;#39;s pain it&amp;#39;s a guide to warn pain I am but when you know me when you once have learned my secret uh how I come to help and bless you guide you warn you lead and teach you when you know my loving nature how at first I gently nudge you and this is the thing the nudges we don&amp;#39;t understand lightly tinge you as a warning hoping by my kind Endeavor you will heed my voice and listen such am I that when you know me you will gladly then embrace me call me friend and give me welcome call me friend and ask my message this the message I would bring you this the secret I would teach you this the warning I would give you this the reason for my visit when you learn to know that NAA in her wise and boundless Mercy in her tender loving kindness in her wisdom and her goodness meant that men should live and labor when you learn to shun the byth leading off to vicious habits when you learn to keep your body strong and clean and pure and active give it work in right proportion give it air and food and water fit to build its every member fit to flourish every function when you teach your mind and spirit pure and Noble thoughts to labor drive out fear and hate and Malice cherish love and kindly motive think of every man and woman as your brother or your sister scorn to do to any other what you would seem what to you would seem Injustice help to build a state and Nation founded on the rock of Freedom see that chance is none is lacking where with all to in a living where with all to live in Comfort when you learn these things I&amp;#39;ve told you when you know them when you do them then I will depart and leave you then will pain be no more needed ah this is so wonderful this then is the truth I bring you that I hurt you but to heal you not to harm you but to teach you thus I come to guide and lead you I am God&amp;#39;s Most Blessed Angel send to point the way to Virtue send to teach the noblest manhood sent to Rouse the soul to action love me trust me heed my message I will bring the peace and blessy and this is the power of pain I love this poem and that&amp;#39;s why I add it in here so when you feel pain instead of fighting it try to relax breathe deeply and acknowledge the pain ask what is this pain trying to teach me why am I in pain what is wrong in my life with the physically mentally emot how does God want to change my life how can I turn this pain into a positive thing in my life we need to learn from pain not to avoid it not to take just a pain killer it wouldn&amp;#39;t work and so there are some basic things that we can do breathing pain usually a lack of oxygen may may be pain may be one of the indicators and so deep breathing is important most people are shallow breathers why we are under stress shallow breathing is an indicator of chronic stress things like chlorophyll and vitamin C is going to help the blood carry more oxygen so you can use that you can even have liquid oxygen that you can use to oxygenate the body but the best one is to deep breathe in the open and then you can help yourself with your pain dehydration most people are not drinking enough water so half an ounce per pound of of body weight is a good average to use no tea and coffee and those things water magnesium is a big one because we have high stress life we deplete our magnesium we&amp;#39;re not eating a lot of vegetables so 200 to 400 um milligrams per day should be helpful magnesium is required for over 300 different processes in the body um I think we did this one already we want to avoid our those things that irritate us the kind of foods we eat they&amp;#39;re highly refined Foods um acid forming diet lack of hydration the environmental toxicity um rottis may be involved here because we damage the brush border in the intestines um a lot of times we have ritis I&amp;#39;ve seen it in in many people and what do we do we just fix the gut that&amp;#39;s a gut issue um especially things like your wheat see how many people are eting the burgers the pizzas the pastas these things damage the gut lining and create problems in that it affects what we call the permeability of the gut and the immune system now responds by attacking the joints um any I found that just about every autoimmune disease is an issue of gut permeability and so you don&amp;#39;t don&amp;#39;t just add um stuff to for the pain in the joints the joints are deteriorating because the immune system is attacking them fix the problem um once you have the cause once you know the cause then you know the Cure um joint stiffness again it it mimics in a lot of instances uh osteoarthritis but it&amp;#39;s very different the shoulders the elbows the ankles and so on symptoms are severe in the morning but improv throughout the day night shades some people can&amp;#39;t use them very well they interfere with calcium absorption and if you have a problem with arthritis remember you&amp;#39;re losing your calcium anyway night shades interfere with calcium absorption so things like your tomatoes and peppers and eggplants and what can help in this situation are your fat soluble vitamins they may help to counteract the impact of the NIT shates vitamin A and D and K and so they are going to be very helpful this is why um it&amp;#39;s important to know your own Constitution your Constitution is your physical and emotional makeup grains many people are not soaking the grains but if they are not soaked your grains and your legumes they affect how you absorb minerals and your bone is made up of at least 12 minerals um the your grains tend to have a high carbohydrate content and that&amp;#39;s going to increase inflammation as inflammation is increase your body is going to pull more nutrients so this is why it&amp;#39;s important important to go Whole Foods so it may be wise for arthritis sufferers to reduce or eliminate these Foods at least temporarily if you have a problem with arthritis grains may not be the best thing for you fasting is a very good thing many people when they start their fast at the beginning of the year would find that they are doing better in their health because you remove the inflammatory trick the inflammation triggers alkalizing your diet especially you know you take out the acid forming food like your animal protein grains and beans and cheese and you go back to fruits and vegetables from Genesis 1 that God gave us to eat again hydration drink more water um your Ides may be a problem the very thing that you using to ease the pain may actually create more problems as well um you have your natural aspirin that you may have and because God made them those plant with your silicates like your willow bar Black Kush winter Green Meadow Sweet um and so on buz actually helps prevent the deterioration of the calage everything we need you remember Genesis chapter 2 verse one thus the heavens and the Earth will finished and what all the host of them do you know that means everything that we need is already provided but we live in ignorance when there is an when there is abundance clinical trials in India and Germany noted significant improvements in pain and stiffness in patients suffering from rumat arthritis who use Bosell yep then you have tumeric anti-inflammatory it inhibits the activity of proin inflammatory re um mingers so God is plac in nature when they are used not simply cumin alone it&amp;#39;s the turmeric that is better now cumin will have a lot of impact it&amp;#39;s naturally anti-inflammatory people may say Well it thins the blood Whole Foods do not operate as when you extract Parts yep corticoids you know that affect your um cortisol level are very important the adrenal gland produces the cortisol that reduces and most um Ines working on this year so your corticosteroid drugs they mimic cortisol they relieve pain but they may have long and shortterm effects so alternatives to your corticosteroid drugs would be like your licorice Yuka and WAM and if you&amp;#39;re concerned about the sugar content in the um in the licorice then you&amp;#39;re looking here at the root which is not as sweet as the leaves and of course you can have the de glycated licorice your essential fatty acids are very important your omegas and so on of course um back and neck pain may cause crumping your magnesium deficiency usually if you have twitching and nervousness um herbs like Lilia so sometimes I may mix some lobilia with some cayenne and use it to rub on the area very effective um Lilia is a natural dilator um black cush is going to ease tension and stress check your circulation as well very important you can enhance circulation with cayenne pepper and ginger and these things these are circulatory enhancers they are pungent herbs and one of the characteristics of pungent herbs is that they cause things to move faster so remember stagnation creates pain when things move pain is gone your nitric oxide enhances like your beetroot and so very helpful for that mild exercise your self massage that you can do with um things like your Lilia your capsicum and winter green and so on your minerals are very important like your silica it is is going to help tissues to be more flexible and less brittle helps with your fingernails and so on your vitamins we talked about that um MSM which is a um methyl sulfon methane Supply sulfur and that is going to Aid liver detoxification reduce the toxicity that may create chronic pain and then God made so many plants your bromine from your pineapple these are very helpful hydrangea very important helpful for for the kidneys to flush better removing toxins hor St provide silica um celery seed alala black horse his divine power had given to us so many things for life and godliness you see God is in the healing business he doesn&amp;#39;t want us to be in pain pain comes because of our ignorance as to how God designed for us but not just our actions alone the actions of others may cause pain as well so if you have stagnation then that&amp;#39;s going to increase inflammation and that is going to improve your create um chronic pain so lymph doesn&amp;#39;t move without physical activity so the more sedentary lifestyle we have the more stagnation we are going to have so you want to to to watch that sedentary lifestyle pain is going to increase wherever we are inactive and sitting massaging is going to move the lymph there&amp;#39;s another thing called lymphosis where you bounce on trampoline you don&amp;#39;t jump you have a mini trampoline your BNS and it&amp;#39;s very helpful um muscles are going to get tired from your posture and overuse of the muscles and stress and so you can stretch do some stretching exercises get rest take rest take get rest and take breaks in between those are going to help and of course God put in the plant will so many things you have CBD and this is not you don&amp;#39;t have to get CBD from marijuana there is hemp there is Damiana there is ainia all these have CBD or CBD like you know we call them cannaboids we have cannabinoid receptors in our bodies one and two and they are they are sensitive to plants with these component just like we have opioid receptors they are anti-inflammatory the omega-3 very important um as your chemical Messengers to help to normalize your immune system and then we have trpt toan trpt toan from tripto you get serotonin so digestive health is going to be important tryptophan produces serotonin which is going to help ease pain magnesium we spoke about that one already anuka Black Kush um capsicum and so on so many plants that God has put for us to use it&amp;#39;s for us to spend time to learn them um Jamaican dogood we spoke to that um Indian pipe um Cava Cava St John&amp;#39;s word Valerian and then we have our essential oils um eucalyptus uh clove is going to num pain you know sometimes you may have a Tock you can use clove very helpful for that lavender I always have lavender very relaxing but not just for one thing these are broad spectrum because whole plants are going to have many components that do many things in the body so if you have 10 problems that involve um stagnation when you use a plant a plant could deal with all of them this is why a person may have many symptoms of a situation and they use one plant and the plant reliev them because it&amp;#39;s going to ease up the stagnation this is what the power of using those things that God has provided right so black cohost you see relaxes muscle tension and reduces stress because it contain what silicates and silicates are pain killing aspirin like compounds and you can use it topically or internally emotionally it helps people who feel trapped especially if they feel like they are wrestling with dark Forces if you look at the plant the roots are dark and Tangled Blackness and the top is white God is going to put the signature in the plant to give us an indication as to how to use it bzel and frankincense um they can be they can East Spain that is associated with wounds and SS you know tendonitis arthritis anxiety sore gums even Chron disease it also helps persons to meditate and gain spiritual Clarity do you know that in in the past yes it helps to when you want to meditate upon the goodness of God it helps as well the California poppy is another one it helps people who seek the light by chasing false goals and coralist you have capsicum most of us know about that we can use it internally externally it really helps to stimulate the circulation the Indian pipe it doesn&amp;#39;t releas pain but it helps you disassociate from it so you are aware of it but you don&amp;#39;t feel it isn&amp;#39;t God awesome it works on the both the physical and the emotional um pain because pain is not only physical it eases panic attack from severe emotional pain this Indian pipe along with Lilia yeah Jamaican dogwood um is a very potent sedative for your migraines and your neuralgia anti-inflammatory painful menstrual period um spasmodic respiratory ailments like asthma and whooping cough and then you have Cav so there are so many things that God has created it is for us to take the time to learn them and he says if you know these things happy e if you would do them I hope that you&amp;#39;ll be able now to get your assessment done and to have your pain removed have a wonderful evening everybody thank you so much brother Bob those of you who are on YouTube we are going to go over to our question and answer so if you would like to come over to our Zoom",

    "transcript": "hi welcome to the Saturday stream where we play a request a game of your choice uh that you vote for uh the requested game for the past couple weeks has been Deadly Premonition 2 which is the sequel to A detective game that we played earlier uh which was very very good that we liked a lot uh this is the sequel which is a prequel sequel have a mixture of both um we&amp;#39;re on the last legs and we are going to be um making sure that we uh finish this game today so we&amp;#39;re playing till it&amp;#39;s done we&amp;#39;re going to kind of there a lot of side quests in this game but we&amp;#39;re going to be basically pushing for the uh pushing for the um ending as much as we can and just mly focusing on the main quest only hey Rocky Pocky how&amp;#39;s it going all right friend so let&amp;#39;s go ahead and try to beat this game as quick as possible not that I am hating the game it&amp;#39;s just I just want it to be over I typically don&amp;#39;t like playthroughs on The Saturdays to go more than 3 weeks I think the longest playthrough we ever had on The Saturdays was um was uh I think it was Majora&amp;#39;s Mask think we did Majora&amp;#39;s Mask cuz and that took us four weeks and we were playing every Thursday too which was wild we were playing that off stream think the on Thursdays too or not we were playing it on the stream but we&amp;#39;re playing on Thursdays too my off day that still took four weeks that they fly around sewing up the mouths of children who don&amp;#39;t do as they&amp;#39;re told in Japan that&amp;#39;s kind of scary some Samurai helmets are also shaped like dragonflies there dragon flies are seen as beneficial insects who March valiantly ahead on the P I actually know this in other words dragon flies symbolize opposite things depending on whether you&amp;#39;re in the East or the west but why did the Clarkson choose this insect to be their symol I can&amp;#39;t help but feel like it&amp;#39;s something deeper than the cliche image of dragonflies as guardians of crops hungan called the dragonfly a flying serpent what if his interpretation was right on the mark the Clarkson are Serpentine Savage cunning and skilled at protecting themselves but they don&amp;#39;t slither ground they&amp;#39;re serpents with wings that allow them to soar above the rest but now those wings are starting to fail on them that&amp;#39;s what really triggered this incident after acquiring Wings the serpent I love this I just love this now it&amp;#39;s lost its power am I supposed to be here moments away from plummeting back down to the Earth so it started lashing out against others just like it used to do before it gained its sounds like an ancient myth doesn&amp;#39;t it Zack that&amp;#39;s why I like these games so much like I actually just learned there a lot like I didn&amp;#39;t know that like I didn&amp;#39;t know that the dragonfly had that like kind of like uh uh mystical meaning in both the East and the West I had no idea and I&amp;#39;ve learned today because because of this game like these games are interesting I really do hope we get a third one even though this one was definitely a far cry from the first Zack do you sense that these trees have watched over this land for the past 300 years how do they do that without eyes long before the Clarkson built up their Town these trees were here if they could speak I wonder what they&amp;#39;d have to say about this case these Graphics are much better than the first yeah to meis cuz this came out in 2020 whereas the last one came out in [Music] 200 20 when when did the first game come out it was a x 360 game initially but also I hope you&amp;#39;re doing well today Tas 2010 I was going to say 2010 but I felt like I was not that was not the right answer but I was right don&amp;#39;t doubt yourself it&amp;#39;s the moral story I guess has there always been a different number yeah this game was a switch exclusive and it finally got a PC Port yeah I heard that by the time our town came along they were only 17 left okay what am I supposed to do with that though oh here we go a general from the south might have cut one down during the Civil War intriguing Patty why did he cut one down I don&amp;#39;t know folks say he planted a red in it place I don&amp;#39;t know if that&amp;#39;s true or not not the red tree stuff if you played the first game you know why that&amp;#39;s bad that&amp;#39;s a red flag no pun intended is that the shape of these seeds they look just like the ones we saw at Lisa&amp;#39;s altar uh oh not these things s down the PS yeah apparently the lore in this game is that on the way into town on our way into town our rent got stolen so now all we have is a skateboard so that&amp;#39;s how we get around now that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s L it that&amp;#39;s the plot the first tree is withered and gone but the shells from its seeds remain perhaps that red tree left some descendants somewhere else oh no not for dog is he in this game oh no I really hope Forest is not in this game oh no Z he seems to know something that we don&amp;#39;t yeah he&amp;#39;s working with doesn&amp;#39;t it seem like he&amp;#39;s trying to guide us somewhere yeah I wouldn&amp;#39;t trust that pup if I were you um what what&amp;#39;s going on change of plans Patty let&amp;#39;s go on a little stroll with that Dalmation uh I don&amp;#39;t think you want to do that just saying the Eerie dation I agree dation is Eerie hello hello hey orb how&amp;#39;s it going how are you friend how is your Saturday treating you at least it doesn&amp;#39;t have that weird music that played in the first game when we were following the Dalmation the original track that played during this scene was very weird although I would take a different music track period uh All Things Considered cuz we&amp;#39;ve been listening to this same Overworld theme for literally the entire game literally the entire [ __ ] video game so that&amp;#39;s not the best wait where the [ __ ] did you go there he is be is going well too it&amp;#39;s going all right I&amp;#39;m living like how you tap the sprint button your stamina was just replenishing where are we going remember argon only has tranquilizer or or like you know rubber pellets it does not actually it&amp;#39;s not a real gun not like the first game hey opsy how is it going friend how are you in the today&amp;#39;s home just awoke well hopefully you feel well rested friend do you have work tonight or are you just fing today no I don&amp;#39;t well that&amp;#39;s good you can Vibe at least where is this dog taking [Music] us this is about as long and arduous as as the first the first game sequence with following the Dalmation but it&amp;#39;s funny because at least that scene was split up intermittently with like cut scenes this is just Lally just following the dog Clarkson Waterworks management Reservoir oh interesting oh no not the red tree not [Music] again I&amp;#39;m assuming this is why in the current day York has uh well Zach rather has issues with uh the color red that&amp;#39;s a phobia of his is this the red tree that General planted no way this is a maple tree a maple tree then it shouldn&amp;#39;t be red at this time of year uh-uh you&amp;#39;re right that&amp;#39;s strange it sure is isn&amp;#39;t it sure is a long time ago my mama and daddy used to come here together a lot they told me they used to go on dates here back before I was born mama you ruined everything then they&amp;#39;d come here and eat them together sandwiches what kind that&amp;#39;s a Make It or Break It from be in a relationship okay my mama was really pretty you know when I was a kid Beauty generation sorry that was rude of me under the BS of a legendary tree that stayed red all year she doing her dad&amp;#39;s thing that&amp;#39;s cute one man managed to win the heart of the did you just make a joke about your own creation and they call him did you just make a joke about yourself being conceived what the you can&amp;#39;t you&amp;#39;re a child you can&amp;#39;t do that looks like it&amp;#39;s time to move on it reminds me my the favorite meme that I see every once in a while is like somebody made a Twitter post that was like man just because two people had sex in the 90s now I got to [ __ ] out my life in he&amp;#39;s just standing there menacingly menacingly yeah just cuz two people you know horizontal Pok it in the 90s now I have to suffer I didn&amp;#39;t ask for this I didn&amp;#39;t ask for existence what a fantastic guide we managed to find he actually waited for us to finish talking before taking us on to the next [Music] spot oh we can use the skateboard while following the dog that&amp;#39;s cute let&amp;#39;s go to Mikus getting insult your avatar looks like an avatar I would have when I was like 12 like a quirky stylized Anime Avatar that would be cool to me if I was 12 years old but you know you try to make it work in 2023 and for that you know honestly good try really for effort I&amp;#39;m also a quadruped now I just uh four wheels instead four legs Quadro wheel quad Quadro wheel what would that be a a quad sickle I don&amp;#39;t know we&amp;#39;re not going to pick that up I&amp;#39;ve not I&amp;#39;ve not picked up an item game I found helpful besides like the antidotes and stuff did I just bump off the dog use them points oh I was going to make a [ __ ] damn I was going to make a new uh I&amp;#39;m going to make a new Redemption today and I forgot I won&amp;#39;t spoil it I may end up running back on it anyway yeah I just I just now remembered I wanted to do that I am kind of mad at myself it&amp;#39;s okay nobody&amp;#39;s perfect at least of all me I&amp;#39;m pretty great though why are we going in circles paperoni you just did a 360 I can do that too this right here this is what we&amp;#39;re doing right now is like 90% of this video game this is why this is a let&amp;#39;s play game and not like a you should play this game cuz this right here takes up I just took one damage to my skateboard for bouncing off the Dalmation what I just did it again why am I taking damage on my skateboard is this an iron dog is it a steel dog how come bumping off of it is like destroying my [ __ ] skateboard what is happening um I would I couldn&amp;#39;t make it over the sidewalk question mark detective D donon talk I almost said donon talk whatever that is yes Tony HW I I&amp;#39;ve said this in this the the different parts of this play through but I&amp;#39;m pretty sure the only reason that you uh don&amp;#39;t have this a car in this game is because well map is really small the map&amp;#39;s just really small so I I feel like they didn&amp;#39;t want you uh being able to Traverse the map in a timely manner cuz you&amp;#39;d realize how [ __ ] tiny it is but alas I already figured it out can&amp;#39;t P me I&amp;#39;m basically only riding on the skateboard I could probably just run after this dog but like then I have to be holding down the sprint button for like egregious amounts of time where is the skateboard I can kind of just drift after him Tomy Hawk&amp;#39;s blood in it is that a thing like in the real life zone is there a skateboard that has his [ __ ] blood in that sounds cursed yes why but why though why is that a thing that soundss like some ritualistic [ __ ] oh here&amp;#39;s the other one what the I like how this tree is not like I like how this tree is not like at all like a like an actual like red tree it&amp;#39;s just like somebody just took that tree texture and just applied it just like a color change over it you know let&amp;#39;s go to Hue and brightness red all right red tree hey Patty hey Patty how would you rate this creation I don&amp;#39;t think this is the most pressing issue right now not bad I reckon they made good use of its natural form while also pulling out the soul from within what the [ __ ] are we talking about the artificial color also looks pretty you don&amp;#39;t usually see this level of Harmony something natural always ends up getting left behind did you catch all that she sounded just like the curator of an art gallery in New York I think we may have just uncovered a new side of her but unfortunately I can&amp;#39;t see anything artistic about it I knew somebody named Haron in uh high school she uh retrospec it was kind of scary because like she everybody was like not scared of her but they were like they they were they were like oh my God Harmon is like like a real deal she&amp;#39;s like an adult because she was like because we were all freshman and then she was dating like like an 18-year-old but in you know retrospect that&amp;#39;s kind of [ __ ] terrifying actually but we were all like oh my God she&amp;#39;s a badass she she pulled an adult but in reality that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s terrifying that&amp;#39;s [ __ ] honestly it looks insane different context now as adults Bo has the most out- of pocket conversations it does that&amp;#39;s all I get from the dialogue is just wild and there&amp;#39;s no way that this is a descendant of the tree that the general planted you all knew that guy you knew that guy that was either a senior or just graduated he had the [ __ ] Cookie Monster hat and always wore pajamas the losers yeah you knew you knew them you know the type you had him in your school don&amp;#39;t lie to me [ __ ] probably already had Osiris shoes as well on a skateboard that blood mix in the paint that sounds very met but also very terrifying at the same time like I said that sounds like the start of a [ __ ] ritual yeah yeah exactly the [ __ ] Cookie Monster ad it&amp;#39;s [ __ ] it&amp;#39;s real [ __ ] man we all knew a guy like that and they were creeps it all turned out that there most of them were creeps that&amp;#39;s why I like that my demographic of stream my streaming demograph are mostly people my age so I can just talk to about you guys about why are you doing a 360 what why didn&amp;#39;t you us to do a 360 around the street and we just talk about really Niche stuff like that from our childhood that&amp;#39;s like really weird are you you&amp;#39;re swimming brother what I can&amp;#39;t follow you through the water hold up hold up got to go across the bridge hey umbre how&amp;#39;s it going this is complete aside but one of the I won&amp;#39;t say who cuz you know you don&amp;#39;t call out lurkers but

this game so everything&amp;#39;s got to take like 30 years like this part right here or it&amp;#39;s going to take a while so what about Allen wake there brand 2 oh you just sent me that out the way dog you do that I don&amp;#39;t think you can I thought he was going to run to the house for a second oh no I just took skateboard damage cuz I just ran into the dog you notice there&amp;#39;s not a single blade of grass in this game like it&amp;#39;s all just grass textures there&amp;#39;s not a single blade of grass like period it&amp;#39;s Eerie this game came out in 2020 by the way hey stop

happening yeah I know I&amp;#39;ve been traveling a while well this dog had more optimal pathing probably wouldn&amp;#39;t be traveling that long but hey I can&amp;#39;t help just going dance to the

to the last tree it makes you redo the entire section if you lose him brother that&amp;#39;s a thousand me what that&amp;#39;s a th000 MERS away brother this game is such a [ __ ] test in patience holy [ __ ] it makes you redo the ENT oh my gosh we popped an all we we just we have to redo the entire section if we lose him holy [ __ ] what were they thinking dude that was like 15 minutes of [ __ ] play time that we have to redo what this is the most stupid [ __ ] I&amp;#39;ve ever played what the [ __ ] that&amp;#39;s just dumb I can&amp;#39;t I literally can&amp;#39;t follow him into the sugar cane I I I can&amp;#39;t like it doesn&amp;#39;t let me so like am I supposed to just guess where he comes out oh and it&amp;#39;s on the other side so I have to go to the bridge hi Phantom say something positive um at least the game&amp;#39;s dialogue is funny this this a funny game hi Isaac how&amp;#39;s how&amp;#39;s the game um most the time it&amp;#39;s good right now it&amp;#39;s being a piece of [ __ ] and I want to punch it in the face this is dumb it makes you just redo this entire segment this is something I would expect out of a like a like a shitty PS2 game not like a game that came out in literally 2020 laughing through the paint of everything that&amp;#39;s the best you can do man that&amp;#39;s the best you can do if you let it get to you life will pull you

would have fixed anything so am I just supposed to guess where he comes out on the other side and just guess correctly and if I don&amp;#39;t have to redo the whole section is that what this game is in playing is this the weird part where he goes through the water oh this is where 360s to the tree for literally no reason yeah yes well that&amp;#39;s hot ass what&amp;#39;s the name of this Quest

don&amp;#39;t know why I&amp;#39;m like not letting you not letting you guys also watch yeah it&amp;#39;s a secret okay yeah this is where it [ __ ] gets me this person is clearly capturing from their actual switch okay this is where he starts cheating like he starts going through the the sugar cane like what am I supposed to do yeah this is where he cheats he just goes through okay wait no what wait he didn&amp;#39;t do that for me he just went into the sugarcane oh no there he goes there it is I was like wait the YouTuber&amp;#39;s like wait what the [ __ ] you can&amp;#39;t do that

the dog goes when the homie just just disappears into the sugar cane for no reason okay okay all right come on paperoni now that I know how you cheat come with [Music] me don&amp;#39;t worry take your sweet time that&amp;#39;s so sad that we were almost at the end of that segment too ah you&amp;#39;re just an exercise of patience aren&amp;#39;t you you&amp;#39;re just here to waste my time I think it&amp;#39;s kind of what are you doing it&amp;#39;s kind of like the thing that like if I would go back and remake this game I would definitely just like fles it out a bit more cuz most of the game really is just kind of like time wasting and it&amp;#39;s like that&amp;#39;s for side quests like it&amp;#39;s a little bit more forgivable but like the main quest is so like this is the main plot right now we&amp;#39;re on the main mission here and there&amp;#39;s so much just like time wasting like in the main blot and it&amp;#39;s like uh okay oh my god get off the [ __ ] skateboard buddy holy [ __ ] this is where he just spins around this and then [ __ ] yeah you just leave stop damaging my skateboard my skateboard was like at like 90 something when we started this Quest now it&amp;#39;s at 80 for all the times the dog has bumped into me H&amp;#39;s destroying my skateboard I bet you can&amp;#39;t pay for it I bet you don&amp;#39;t have a job so you going to pay for that buddy all for the na movie I&amp;#39;ve heard people have been saying that it&amp;#39;s not as bad as people are making it out to be that&amp;#39;s actually not that terrible just a pleasant surprise h could you make this take any longer buddy you&amp;#39;re L supposed to be the fastest among us us bipad so really slow compared to you guys oh my gosh well at least I know when he goes to that backyard he just comes right back out so I&amp;#39;m just going to like wait politely for him out here yeah does he do that like there&amp;#39;s literally no reason for him to do that besides to waste my time I miss when this game was just like a like a hot ripoff of wind Peaks I think that&amp;#39;s when it was like at its peak he pun intended I don&amp;#39;t know what this [ __ ] is should have found something else to rip off you know I just realized you&amp;#39;re never going to be able to unse this your skateboard wheels actually don&amp;#39;t turn at all oh no I&amp;#39;m never going to be able to unse see that your skateboard wields are actually just completely stationary they don&amp;#39;t move at all oh my gosh great thanks God they don&amp;#39;t move at all oh sorry did I get ahead of you he&amp;#39;s going to shove me out of the way here in a second please don&amp;#39;t I&amp;#39;m sorry okay this where he [ __ ] cheats and runs into the left for no reason why does he do that besides to being a dick where you at bud I&amp;#39;m on to you this time I have the power of Googling at my side yeah they couldn&amp;#39;t even animate the [ __ ] skateboard wheels turning 30y man year old man skateboard I&amp;#39;m actually pretty sure he&amp;#39;s like really young in this in the cuz this is a prequel so I&amp;#39;m pretty sure he&amp;#39;s probably in his early 20s in this or he&amp;#39;s more like my age probably finally don&amp;#39;t really specify old he is that makes sense then well they say he&amp;#39;s like in his like 40s I think in the in like this in you know the the sequel part of this game before they flashback so we could probably like date it somehow doing that stuff okay evil dog I&amp;#39;m here Zack now this is interesting it looks like a tree that you could find anywhere yet it&amp;#39;s also unlike any other completely alien and look how it&amp;#39;s we its way into the landscape almost like cancer cells invading a human body you might not even notice it unless you&amp;#39;re focused on finding it and this feeling as i gaze upon this tree I can feel evil emotions rising out from within me why on Earth did that southern General bring this tree into this town don&amp;#39;t touch it what is this zoan what is this what is happening yeah stop her I promis to protect you from all the evil in our world do not touch this tree wait who shaved me wait who shaved me I had a nice beard who shaved me I just realized that wait a [ __ ] minute we successfully spoke with the 17 comrades I feel like they showed us a side of nature that transcends the Realms of human knowledge next up is the holy Allah according to the Oracle the holy Allah needs to be filled we may be doe for another childish puzzle soon want you to shave yourk but I like my beard on your but that&amp;#39;s okay after all we came all the way out here to The Boondocks why not enjoy playing by their rules for a bit no nobody no no no no no I I don&amp;#39;t want to be here longer than I have to and now we got to go 2,000 ft away [Music] Lena doen AKA Professor R how could such an intelligent person like her suffer such a tragic downfall does the South really corrupt people like Patty said this sunlight certainly seems capable of breaking we get it we&amp;#39;re in the [ __ ] South how you try to resist it it&amp;#39;s so hot it feels like I&amp;#39;m burning up explain it perhaps we really do need to focus on the Clarks and blood line itself everything in this town whether it&amp;#39;s Vis why is the game like dying it all carries shades of influence buildings people conversations hased the car yet I don&amp;#39;t know why we can&amp;#39;t just get another [ __ ] rental is beond of the breath cre I get that our rental was stolen but why can&amp;#39;t we just get another one what is stopping us exactly involved in thiss us all we need to know you think what stands us now aren&amp;#39;t you me like this not even your usual drug case it&amp;#39;s the history of sin it&amp;#39;s weighing down the shoulders of massive history of sin and we&amp;#39;re simp Souls wanding through colossal W the do Souls P Jiminy Cricket put our heads together find the way out no matter what we go up against no matter what situation we find ourselves in our mission never changes we need to apprehend the perpetrator and bring them to justice it&amp;#39;s as simple as that Z it&amp;#39;s just easy peasy we could have done it in an hour if we wanted to did you notice it yet the streets in New Orleans were a mess okay busted up just going to bump into that wall to shut him up we already heard that one before already heard that bud yeah this is why you don&amp;#39;t have a car this right here cuz like this game would be over in like like like [ __ ] like 2 minutes if you could [ __ ] actually use a car to get around this right here this is the main reason that there&amp;#39;s no car please just get me there please okay I was like please don&amp;#39;t bump into that please don&amp;#39;t tell me the railway has [ __ ] solid Collision or some weird [ __ ] hey we can go save that way we don&amp;#39;t have to do that whole [ __ ] dog running section again in case it something bad happens did you notice anything strange before your daddy went missing did he seem yeah we&amp;#39;re just not addressing or say things that didn&amp;#39;t make sense nope he was the same as always we talked a lot I reckon he was in a better mood than usual almost even too talkative Zach she&amp;#39;s putting on a strong face but it&amp;#39;s clear that she&amp;#39;s very worried try and cheer her up a bit what&amp;#39;s the best thing to say in times like these you don&amp;#39;t need to worry about me Agent York let&amp;#39;s just focus on the work we have left to do unfortunately it looks like your parents disappearing is connected with this case somehow yeah I know Melvin seems to love you so much it&amp;#39;s hard for me to believe he would just disappear and leave you all alone something must be a foot here I could tell you I&amp;#39;m sure they&amp;#39;re okay even without any evidence but I hate lies Patty I can&amp;#39;t guarantee that they&amp;#39;re safe that&amp;#39;s my hon a little dark try to prepare myself for it but I want to hope that they&amp;#39;re okay of course she&amp;#39;s a kid I feel the same way but if you happen to think of anything that might help please let me know even the tiniest piece of information could end up coming in handy yeah I understand but I really don&amp;#39;t know anything I just feel like I know that Mama&amp;#39;s okay somehow meaning even when we&amp;#39;re apart I can always tell how my mama&amp;#39;s feeling you know like how twins can sense each other&amp;#39;s feelings that&amp;#39;s it I can&amp;#39;t tell where she is she&amp;#39;s doing besides I&amp;#39;m just a kid can&amp;#39;t really trust what I&amp;#39;m saying can you Zach it seems like she and her mother possess some kind of secret Bond but we shouldn&amp;#39;t try to force it out of her yes you&amp;#39;re exactly right let&amp;#39;s just keep our eyes on her for now okay this thing sure looks tall when you look at it up close but why do they got to build it up so high anyway the height gives them the necessary pressure to pump the water out also building it in a spot where anyone could easily access it would only create more problems true problems in a certain Missouri Town they built the water tower low enough that a person could easily climb up to it and that&amp;#39;s exactly where a mass murderer decided to hide the bodies of all his victims the water tower was so low to the ground that he could even climb up to it while carrying a dead body on his back well that&amp;#39;s [ __ ] incidentally they ended up finding a total of 43 bodies in there W but the part that truly shocked Zach and I wasn&amp;#39;t the number of bodies Patty what it was the fact that over the six months from the first murder to when the case was solved that whole time the town&amp;#39;s people had been drinking the water e agent York look I think we can climb up from there let&amp;#39;s go but Patty I was just getting to the good part don&amp;#39;t Scar the child get back to your work I had to press that like five times so this is our town looking down on it from here it&amp;#39;s hard to imagine any bad stuff ever happened at all listen carefully Patricia Patricia you just leave to me I promise I&amp;#39;ll take care of things you&amp;#39;re grown up she&amp;#39;s not of an adult she in this town I she&amp;#39;s a kid no she&amp;#39;s not but that doesn&amp;#39;t mean you have to suffer through everything without ever saying a word about it just remember that okay she&amp;#39;s definitely not growing up there but just saying why is there a squirrel in there Zach it looks like the holy Allah hasn&amp;#39;t been sucking up water properly no wonder the shower in our hotel room felt so weak Patty who manages this water tower this is lucar you should know the answer to that by now the Clarkson the Clarks wo I&amp;#39;m right Jud from situation I don&amp;#39;t think they&amp;#39;ll be able to give us a timely response good morning how you man do you know where the water comes from Lake that settles it let&amp;#39;s fill the holy Allah and solve this problem ourselves I knew you were going to say that agent York why are we fixing the town&amp;#39;s water why is this related to a murder case regretting my decisions trust me DVD was not worth it kind somebody plays it all the time DVD is not worth it not worth all that we&amp;#39;ve already heard this how could such there&amp;#39;s so many repeat conversations in this game if they were hydrated they may not be evil anymore oh okay cly seems capable of breaking someone down no matter how you try to resist it it&amp;#39;s so hot it feels like I&amp;#39;m burning up but that doesn&amp;#39;t explain it perhaps we really do need to focus on the Clarks and bloodline itself everything in this town whether it&amp;#39;s visible or invisible it all carries shades of their influence buildings people conversations food we got it right down to each blade of grass there isn&amp;#39;t anything beyond the reach of the Clarkson&amp;#39;s breath even son Rouge itself was created by Clarkson woo po an just looking at the people involved in this Cas tells us all we need to know don&amp;#39;t you think what stands before us now aren&amp;#39;t your usual serial killers not even your usual drug case it&amp;#39;s the history of sin that&amp;#39;s weighing down the shoulders of a massive entity known as the clarkon family and we&amp;#39;re simply lost souls wandering through it colossal that was abrupt just suddenly didn&amp;#39;t even get off the skateboard Isaac Lake that&amp;#39;s the name of the former head of the Clarkson family I remembered that when he retired they built this Lake to commemorate his career that&amp;#39;s why it&amp;#39;s called Isaac Lake wow they wanted people to remember remember the power of the Clarkson family every time they use their water huh you sure don&amp;#39;t miss a bead the water levels higher than I expected they probably haven&amp;#39;t been out here to check on it since lease was murdered I bet that&amp;#39;s where the water gets sucked up into the water tower gor Mr Alligator okay never thought I&amp;#39;d have to use you to fight a real alligator just what does that skeletal gentleman have in mind for a

you destroyed them [ __ ] is happening Satan Satan not quite Daniel I&amp;#39;m just an agent carrying out a mission in accordance with federal law on the contrary I came to put a stop to all these problems you might even consider thanking me for it federal law Mission accordance did you hear that bastard wants me to thank him well this took a turn I lost everything my treasure least my own baby girl I I don&amp;#39;t know I don&amp;#39;t know what I&amp;#39;m going to do now yeah has lost almost his entire family you reap what you s hey Patty now is not the time God damn it whether you like it or not you&amp;#39;re the new heir to the Clarkson Legacy you could rebuild their empire or resign it to the ravages of time do whatever you like but you&amp;#39;ll no longer be able to borrow a certain someone&amp;#39;s power and March around like you own this town you need to accept that prepare to survive I mean he did lose his entire family what&amp;#39;s he doing Zach it&amp;#39;s no use the skeletal gentleman is a strict one that&amp;#39;s for sure we&amp;#39;re going to have to figure out what the giant lady&amp;#39;s finger is if we want to continue on with this Oracle L&amp;#39;s finger ladies finger I don&amp;#39;t like the way you&amp;#39;re saying that I&amp;#39;m at a Los Z the only thing that comes to mind is a certain lady in glasses who displayed her middle finger to a truck driver huh the student driver who was driving the car that Leslie neelen jumped into in order to chase down a criminal what 1988 directed by David suer the Naked Gun okay never mind he was making a refence that car chase was terrific it felt like we were watching one of our own car chases from The Real World that director must have gotten some advice from actual police officers otherwise there&amp;#39;s no way he would have been able to film such a realistic Chase hey agent York can I say something hey back to the back to the main thing in hand there friend we get it you like movies if you&amp;#39;re looking for ladies fingers you know that&amp;#39;s another name for okra right another name for okra yeah is pretty common here in Louisiana so most people know about its other name huh okra my talented assistant strikes again you solve the Oracle instead of of me let&amp;#39;s hurry over to the okra farm at once then and find the biggest piece of okra while we&amp;#39;re at you like that L hey agent York the key word is giant so it must be rather large sorry it was right there positively grotesque Zack and just imagine the stickiness I was joking I think I&amp;#39;ll refrain from taking a bite hey agent York hey yo indeed Our Town doesn&amp;#39;t have an okra Farm no okra Farm relax just follow me I reckon I know where we&amp;#39;re supposed to go tired for this and whose fault is that who did [Music] that I run faster than you even when I&amp;#39;m just tapping this but I go faster than you her run animation she&amp;#39;s just flopping around it&amp;#39;s so funny how far are we running there pal there&amp;#39;s the depending on where we&amp;#39;re going this may take forever and I whenever I get on my skateboard you just disappear so uh I don&amp;#39;t know about this Chief where are you going I have a feeling we&amp;#39;re going to be here a while she looks like a little Goblin like why are your hands out like that look at that look at her she looks like a goblin I&amp;#39;m going to steal The Adventurous gold oh no they did her so dirty with that animation hey Bagel how&amp;#39;s it going how are you friend she&amp;#39;s just excited you know what&amp;#39;s funny so uh we I&amp;#39;ve talked about this before my my brother has autism and um you know obviously since he&amp;#39;s my younger brother I&amp;#39;ve known him his whole life he used to like he used to run like that cuz like one of his like hand tick like one of his ticks is that his like hand flaps it&amp;#39;s like one of the things he does so like you know if he ever had to like you know it would actually wouldn&amp;#39;t look too dissimilar to this because like you know like the hand flaps would be going but he would also be going at the same time I was trying to get him to come out for uh for open lobbies yesterday but he uh he&amp;#39;s he&amp;#39;s he seems a little shy to talk to chat I was trying to tell him that he&amp;#39;s like a side character now like like you&amp;#39;re you&amp;#39;re part of the plot you&amp;#39;re the best supporting character they love you to death but he he didn&amp;#39;t want to show up I tried though it would just be it would also just be funny for the novelty of just having two Mr headaches in one [ __ ] Lobby you know just making a double take for a second be like what I know he&amp;#39;s yeah you guys would love him he&amp;#39;s he&amp;#39;s he&amp;#39;s a cool dude he&amp;#39;s a sweet dude a you just tried to just shoulder check me what was that you also told the frame rate of the game so s about the VA issues on Tuesday yeah yeah I was too it&amp;#39;s okay though technology breaks it&amp;#39;s fixed for next Tuesday you know it&amp;#39;s fine it&amp;#39;s not fine but well it is fine in the long run it doesn&amp;#39;t matter it sucked in the moment but it&amp;#39;ll be okay right at the end of the day it&amp;#39;s not the end of the world she&amp;#39;s got those little legs I like I we&amp;#39;re supposed to be in like you know like every two seconds York is like the the the beating sun is is down upon what the what the can you get down from there what are you anyways I should probably no don&amp;#39;t do it hey agent York okay where you going I thought I was going to do thing was going to make restart okay sorry I was trying to shoot at whatever those weird balloons are I was like please don&amp;#39;t make me restart just eat okra okra rry mhm is this where we&amp;#39;re supposed to be yes it is am I not allowed to [ __ ] okay whatever I can only this is the giant lady&amp;#39;s finger okra boy he&amp;#39;s kind of like the town mascot he&amp;#39;s got the dragonfly on his tie okra boy you&amp;#39;re right no matter how you look at him he really is a giant lady&amp;#39;s finger but Patty there&amp;#39;s no okra Farm in this town is there that&amp;#39;s right then why did they choose okra for the town mascot good question good question he&amp;#39;s been here for as long as I can remember daddy said he remembers OK boy being around when he was a kid there&amp;#39;s another clip of that that&amp;#39;s hilarious uh it&amp;#39;s I was playing Resident Evil 4 make and we&amp;#39;re doing the water room which is infamously one of the hardest rooms in in Resident Evil and and Ashley&amp;#39;s like the the room split into two parts this is important to to to to establish first the room split into two parts you do a first enemy wave and then you do a second enemy wave so I knew this cuz I played the original so I know it&amp;#39;s coming so I we beat the first half of the room and Ashley says wow like we&amp;#39;re done we did it and I go we&amp;#39;re not out of the woods yet Ashley and then half a second later Leon&amp;#39;s like we&amp;#39;re not out of the woods yet and I&amp;#39;m like what the [ __ ] the plot thickens let&amp;#39;s follow that white glove yeah the running joke is like Chris redfield&amp;#39;s my favorite res evil character but I&amp;#39;m actually just Leon instead Patty that&amp;#39;s it and a bowl of gumbo see you&amp;#39;re getting you&amp;#39;re getting the South down you got it the Deep South so this used to be the control device for the drawbridge but it looks like its insides have been replaced with something else oh yeah I remember remember daddy telling me about this this draw bridge hasn&amp;#39;t been used for decades now it hasn&amp;#39;t drawn anything in forever man Art&amp;#39;s good for you so the control room doesn&amp;#39;t work and the power&amp;#39;s been disconnected starts pressing buttons a password that requires three letters looks that way what&amp;#39;s this then yeah what comes up must come down I it&amp;#39;s scary that people do that there&amp;#39;s an H on the top bottom and left sides of the leftmost panel she starts mashing it Patty trial and error won&amp;#39;t get us anywhere hey I have brute forced many of puzzles especially in Resident Evil there are 26 letters in the alphabet which makes for 17,576 different combinations if we use three of them okay well if you phrase it that way it does seem kind of Bleak let&amp;#39;s try something more efficient I know that I was just fiddling with it so what do you want to try agent York just leave this to Zach can [Music] I Zack this password may look complicated at first glance but you needn&amp;#39;t worry this is a chemical formula a challenge from Professor R the H that&amp;#39;s tattooed all over the leftmost panel stands for hydrogen in other words the leftmost panel represents the molecule you get when three hydrogen atoms merge all we need to do is figure out which chemicals go in the remaining panel try reviewing what we know we spoke to the 17 comrades who what the or filled the holya then found the giant lady&amp;#39;s finger pointing toward the entrance supposed to be help after we met the 17 comrades we encountered that ominous red tree there was sap dripping out from the red tree&amp;#39;s trunk wasn&amp;#39;t there that must have been a metaphor for wood vinegar then in order to fill the holy allaha we went to the reservoir the water tower represents a distillator in the water represents coolant wood vinegar distillator and water Zack figured it out yet the chemical formula is ch3 methanol it&amp;#39;s got to be C you just tell me from the left in that order methanol is highly you don&amp;#39;t even let me figure it out you just tell me from alahh this has Professor R&amp;#39;s name written all over it that Oracle really sent us on a roundabout Mission this time it almost feels like we&amp;#39;re playing a video game here talk about stupid so you don&amp;#39;t I don&amp;#39;t get to figure out you just tell me okay all right okay no fun allowed I guess circle of healing you can&amp;#39;t touch that oh hi I haven&amp;#39;t seen you pants scientist said no why are you still wearing your ice clothes out in the middle of broad daylight there brother Avery Smith draw bridge don&amp;#39;t work no more The Machine&amp;#39;s junk yep you&amp;#39;re right Avery but don&amp;#39;t worry I got permission to touch it permission agent York you got permission he doesn&amp;#39;t look like a giant refrigerator so that&amp;#39;s right permission from the president of the United States I still love that first response I had where do they feed a bricks that was a good one pants okay I didn&amp;#39;t see nothing yep won&amp;#39;t tell no one NE what the [ __ ] hey agent York are you really going in there you should have seen the first game was first game was first game&amp;#39;s like 40 times better than this yes but it&amp;#39;s still got that same level of just zaniness I&amp;#39;m getting kind of scared that&amp;#39;s a rare word to hear coming from your mouth Patty I don&amp;#39;t see much in there aside from some overgrown weeds do you no that&amp;#39;s not it I&amp;#39;m not scared of the weeds I&amp;#39;m scared of what you&amp;#39;ll find agent York you don&amp;#39;t need to worry Patty you&amp;#39;re my precious assistant remember I promise I&amp;#39;ll protect you no matter what happens sorry the game like please don&amp;#39;t do that I was kind hit by a car too all right enjoy your like as much as it can Patty the truth is when I first saw okra boy I remembered something horrific the most evil monster I&amp;#39;ve ever seen in fact a monster oh yes a demon incarnate who plunged New York City into mortal fear it is Bagel it really is the stay puffed Marshmallow Man marshmallow Ghostbusters 1984 directed by Ivan wman now that&amp;#39;s a film that was filled to the brim with Bonafide horror Bonafide not Bonafide a true Masterpiece that boasted an honest depiction of just how frightening a real ghost would be even if you watched it now I&amp;#39;m sure it would still chill you to the Bone first night I watched it I was too afraid to go to the bathroom alone so I made Zach come with me now he was like aren&amp;#39;t you supposed to be leaving the door the door you say that like you can&amp;#39;t just like easily crawl under that fence what is happening hello what is going on I have so many questions why are we in Silent Hill H we&amp;#39;re just suddenly in Silent Hill world out of nowhere s least I got my handgun wow it&amp;#39;s interesting that we&amp;#39;re uh that Patty can see the Silent Hill world what are these guys they&amp;#39;re new why are they crawling creepy monsters what that all about to sleep tonight or for the rest of her [ __ ] life apparently what are these creepy things these guys are weird those are actually kind of eerie I don&amp;#39;t like those those homie it&amp;#39;s been so long stop it stop stop doing what you&amp;#39;re doing it was so good to see you the other day and to see you here hope life been treating you well oh don&amp;#39;t do that don&amp;#39;t do whatever you&amp;#39;re doing watch a lot of twitch for a while I mean that&amp;#39;s fine we&amp;#39;ll always be here we will always be here oh there&amp;#39;s a guy behind me life always comes first oh not the killer crabs oh you can shoot those I never knew that oh that&amp;#39;s interesting SNF there&amp;#39;s a lot of enemies no stop giving the crabs where are you still [Music] alive Patty&amp;#39;s going to get blown up by explosive crabs okay you get out of here okay we good we fine no more bad guys at least for the time being there were a lot there were a lot might do see a therapist after this you know that&amp;#39;s fair Zack I think we found a laboratory good thing they&amp;#39;re on well this is 2005 so this a period piece so actually there there may not be robust online services for a therapy yet what&amp;#39;s a therapist I think you should get if you have uh uh uh needs o we going to start an inspection organ I love that piano a research log no it looks more like a journal look Zach this belonged to Lena doen it&amp;#39;s so funny to swallow that child of TR like the rest of us well adulthood and then you&amp;#39;re like wow a lot of things I went through were not normal this book is filled with all sorts detailed notes you mean that&amp;#39;s not part of the normal human experience uh oh that&amp;#39;s not good H she studied abroad during school most likely in order to get as far away from her father&amp;#39;s Prejudice as possible abroad she studied chemistry and fire Dynamics then cultivated the groundwork for son Rouge huh if what&amp;#39;s written in this journal is to be believed son Rouge is a naturally derived well if you remember from the first game Al that must mean it&amp;#39;s something AK to Zach is the real person York is a personality that Z made to cope with his mother&amp;#39;s murder so techically Zack&amp;#39;s the real person York is just his who he lets Take the Wheel so to speak Zack look at this it says that when Lena was still known as Lenny she once fell in love with you know it&amp;#39;s actually like really she fell in love with her older sister that matches up with what PJ mentioned just before he died mhm and apparently they had a daughter I think the more I think the more appropriate in medical term nowadays is did but yes although he hasn&amp;#39;t officially been diagnosed by anybody in the gamees universe that what you described as and got married then she must still be somewhere in this town my former brother-in-law actually did have did so did you know about all this it&amp;#39;s definitely way overblown uh what people perceive that as why can&amp;#39;t I reinspect the journal again this entry is from right after she Len Zack what could this mean a Salesman passing through that changed my life she didn&amp;#39;t create until after she met this person to you lied he said he wasn&amp;#39;t in this game fanatically worshiping someone she also ceases to mention anything more about her older sister and the word of fertility starts appearing [Music] everywhere I thought I&amp;#39;m not as educated on the subject as I probably should be so it might be something you guys have to look into yourself but I was to my understanding at least my brother my former brother law described it was that it was like a more appropriate and more modern term to call it uh like medically proper to be like diso identity disorder and schizophrenia is like an old world kind of way to refer to it but he could have been wrong I would look into it who&amp;#39;s the fo King I would assume he would know about something that he deals with but that was just what he told me it appears that Len&amp;#39;s worried about whether or not the fool King will be able to stop our investigation and successfully murder this bu King FK in the coffee mhm y it&amp;#39;s all come in background Philip or Professor no it can&amp;#39;t be yo Sonic thanks much for L friend I&amp;#39;m M appreciate that friend oh hopefully your Saturday is going well no don&amp;#39;t kill him trums tends to follow the disease consequence of the illness it&amp;#39;s not CA is a reaction so schizophrenia is at least according to whatever you looked up it&amp;#39;s schizophrenia is more um inherent whereas did is like something that develops if I&amp;#39;m reading that correctly somebody hit me did they take Patty it seems like they took Patty oh hi that&amp;#39;s not who I expected to see hi there hungan long time no [Music] see H this is definitely your simplest Oracle by far Patty now it all makes sense doesn&amp;#39;t Zach we need to hurry back to the hotel and put all this in order probably the beginning of chapter 4 which should be our last chapter all the monsters gone Pat just a f imagination no Patty is I&amp;#39;m pretty sure what we&amp;#39;re about to get revealed to us which is something I&amp;#39;ve been guessing is that Patty is uh [ __ ] Lena&amp;#39;s yeah Lena is her name Lena&amp;#39;s daughter and she&amp;#39;s actually a Clarkson at least I think that&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s about to get revealed just after all that just B [Music] everything&amp;#39;s fine my friend&amp;#39;s been kidnapped everything&amp;#39;s fine dude wow okay you can&amp;#39;t ride your skateboard here wa Lena actually kill yeah Lena blew herself up uh to kill PJ with her to kind of supposedly to destroy the Clarkson family so yeah so she is dead for all intents and purposes that we know of some more car do tricks I can do this woo I can do a little spin sorry bud sorry trumpet man we&amp;#39;re doing main plot today cuz you&amp;#39;re probably going to send me on a side quest that I take forever and probably won&amp;#39;t be that interesting either what my my suit got dirty it&amp;#39;s the first time I I&amp;#39;ve been washing my suits that&amp;#39;s interesting I wonder maybe the plot Som against them yeah I want to beat this today cuz we we&amp;#39;ve been on this for quite some time actually should probably sleep well sleep this m of night but that&amp;#39;s okay can&amp;#39;t remember last time we slept this game does have a food and like sleep meter but it just kind of like I don&amp;#39;t know it doesn&amp;#39;t seem like it&amp;#39;s consistent it doesn&amp;#39;t seem to remember that it exists a lot like I&amp;#39;ll just go a full day without sleeping or eating and the game just like I don&amp;#39;t know what&amp;#39;s happening we don&amp;#39;t need to see this like I order food and it just shows him drinking coffee oh my go oh oh the game is having a malfunction hello I will shower again now that I have okay get my oh uhoh well my new suit&amp;#39;s not going to be ready for 9 hours so that&amp;#39;s not good could just sleep again but we&amp;#39;ll see we&amp;#39;ll just do this stuff first we found many new truths hidden in Lenard Doan&amp;#39;s Journal some of them went far beyond our wildest dreams first we should clear up who PJ&amp;#39;s first daughter is she was a complete mystery until now but after reading Lena&amp;#39;s Journal I became convinced of something she still lives somewhere in this town Lena&amp;#39;s Journal stated that this woman married someone from the same town did you figure it out yet Zack who is PJ Clarkson&amp;#39;s first daughter candy Woods yes Melvin&amp;#39;s beloved wife the most beautiful woman in town candy she&amp;#39;s PJ clar dark&amp;#39;s First Daughter which means that just like Galina candy also carries his blood now we know why Melvin Said that Galina was a beauty who could attract a lot of attention candy had no interest in The Inheritance and was also sexually liberated what&amp;#39;s that mean that must be why PJ ended up coddling Lena so much Candi is supposedly sick but she&amp;#39;s now become a key person in our case she must be why Melvin&amp;#39;s gone missing Melvin&amp;#39;s beloved wife candy committed a transgression in her past Zack what was it that&amp;#39;s right candy had intercourse with Lena is he just not finishing that dialog interesting to a child a child that we know very well yeah we never heard any mention of her biological father anywhere in town despite how much these country folk love to spread rumors I knew there had to be some secret connected to her birth but I never thought it&amp;#39;d be something like this it&amp;#39;s beyond anything I ever could have imagined Zack next up is the fool King Zack FK in the coffee all you need to do is pick out the person who acted most like a fool when we encountered them honestly the answer is clear and it&amp;#39;s a painful one to accept isn&amp;#39;t it Zach Melvin he&amp;#39;s got to be the foing hey D see way he&amp;#39;s acted from the moment he located Lisa&amp;#39;s body up to now the way Galina was murdered silenced without any resistance his Discord with the Clarkson PJ left behind and the engineer bootprints we saw at the discovery site it feels like the missing puzzle pieces are all falling into place now but why did he decide to take part in Lena&amp;#39;s plan to play catchup he uh he just randomly went missing we also found out he was transphobic which was not great not very not great but he went missing in the middle of last uh play through according to Patricia he seemed to be avoiding Lena there&amp;#39;s no way he actually could have believed that the goddess of fertility would come and save the town oh so that&amp;#39;s it Melvin as you nursed candy you too became corrupted by son Rouge drugs Rob people of their judgment they slowly but surely eat away at their users that&amp;#39;s most likely the reason it took Lena so long to enact her plan I don&amp;#39;t know what to say Zach this is absolutely unbearable Lena fell in love with her older sister candy and the two of them had intercourse but afterwards Lena realized that there was a disparity between her body and her mind and descended into suffering finally Lena left home and decided to live on as Professor R meanwhile candy fell in love with Mel Apple it&amp;#39;s good to see to her leaving home as well hopefully your night is treating you well I could only guess that Lena and candi&amp;#39;s relationship continued after they left home then their Strange Love transformed into something else that bound them together in a powerful New Way Lena must have periodically delivered son Rouge to Candy by fishales how&amp;#39;d you like it as offerings to the goddess of fertility it&amp;#39;s hard to keep going with this Zach you know where it&amp;#39;s all leading don&amp;#39;t you D scar a lot it&amp;#39;s a really good game if Lena&amp;#39;s plan was to kill off every last Clarken aside from her goddess then her next Target is PJ&amp;#39;s last living descendant she&amp;#39;s in danger we need to hurry Zach the climax is upon us whoever hit me in that control room sure wasn&amp;#39;t holding back the blow was so devastating that I passed out instantly AR which is actually really really bad for your brain it&amp;#39;s one of the things in like Hollywood and stuff that like is it factual it&amp;#39;s like yeah people just get knocked out all the time and it&amp;#39;s fine it&amp;#39;s like that actually [ __ ] up your brain real bad they hit me right in my head so my memor people just wake up fine not my finest hour to say the least now what should we do next first we&amp;#39;re going to need to refresh ourselves a little sunbathing Zach let&amp;#39;s go bask in some liquid Sunshine that&amp;#39;s just as hot as the Sun out there I don&amp;#39;t think that&amp;#39;s a priority right now Sunshine he said so we&amp;#39;re going to have to I think we&amp;#39;re just going to go sleep again cuz it is not the sun is not out yet even cleaning zero hours what okay we&amp;#39;ll sleep for 1 hour so apparently we are not able to get our suit out yet there we go yeah the chase mechanics and Outlast are pretty fun I think guessing we just go outside about sunshine [Music] okay there&amp;#39;s just coffee I guess do I drink coffee I should have some no how bad is this second one a lot of people like it but I kind of hate it I think it&amp;#39;s just I think it&amp;#39;s writing is really cringey and yeah I think it&amp;#39;s writing is really cringey and kind of it seems like it was written by like an edgy teenager just for shock value but some people like it especially Outlast fans apparently fans are like that one&amp;#39;s pretty important to the lore and all that stuff and I&amp;#39;m like how&amp;#39;s this game go from like Hey we&amp;#39;re going to literally spell out the answer to a puzzle for you and then like you just need some sort of drink to make you happy and then it&amp;#39;s just like yeah we&amp;#39;re not going to tell you what that is and also why are we preoccupied with doing this instead of helping Patty seems kind of silly okay I don&amp;#39;t have time for this game games I don&amp;#39;t have time for it yeah it&amp;#39;s coffee and I&amp;#39;m right but it&amp;#39;s only coffee from the specific Diner you have to go to the bowling Diner and get that specific coffee like apparently drinking normal coffee does not [ __ ] count appar that doesn&amp;#39;t count for whatever reason I have to go specifically to the bowling alley and get their coffee okay [Music] I don&amp;#39;t know why you can&amp;#39;t just drink coffee in general that seems so weirdly restrictive and the fact that it doesn&amp;#39;t give you like a quest marker for it either for like no reason is also really weird I don&amp;#39;t know why this game makes the decisions it does oh my Lord you sure look pooped honey hello Alexis very nice way to say you look like [ __ ] did quite the number on me must have given you one heck of a Sher well let me get you some coffee so you can relax honey yes that&amp;#39;s it Alexis just what I was waiting for would it be possible to get an especially pungent cup smoldering with all the heat of the southern side we get it we&amp;#39;re in the South coming right up if you didn&amp;#39;t know we&amp;#39;re in the South if in case it wasn&amp;#39;t obvious [Music] gosh this game Zach look [Music] what the heck Santa whoa whoa whoa what was that what was that holy [ __ ] what you trying to do Wake the Dead what&amp;#39;s wrong honey whoa where is this boat house located oh my Lord what&amp;#39;s going on with you your poor voice is positively trembling just tell me where is this boat house located there&amp;#39;s lots of boat houses around these parts honey your guess is good as mine well then can you at least tell me when this photo was taken looks to me like it was taken during the Clarks and Campbell wedding party when PJ married his ex-wife Audrey there was a building this tall in town back then oh you know what that must be the cold storage Warehouse that big billboard on the roof is the Clarkson see I bet you&amp;#39;d be able to get a great view of all the boat houses in the swamp from up there thank you that&amp;#39;s all the info I need would you mind if I borrowed this shoot of course not honey thanks for your help and keep the change oh my Lord what is she doing just standing there miss Carpenter no not the time yeah yor gets a lot more upset than this game that he like in the first game which is interesting it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s weird because the first game Tech takes place after this flashback that we&amp;#39;re seeing so like kind of interesting to think about that he&amp;#39;s like way more more mellow despite this uh potentially shaking him up do I just have the thing unlocked yeah I&amp;#39;m just going to start using this instead of doing the [ __ ] the uh skateboard stuff just BK them say okay wait it told me to come to the cold storage Warehouse do we have to go to like a specific side of it not right now do not talk oh what are you doing here buddy what are you up to oh it&amp;#39;s you I I reckon I owe you an apology for how I was acting before I think I get what you meant now you&amp;#39;ll no longer be able to borrow a certain someone&amp;#39;s power those words woke me up I need to get myself together or I&amp;#39;ll sink you save me really with that little of a conversation so uh thanks now this is a surprise Zach can a human being really turned themselves around this quickly no the answer is no hey come on don&amp;#39;t say that I was drunk you know I lost my baby girl my wife that&amp;#39;s what I was saying then my father-in-law I didn&amp;#39;t know what to do blame it at all on someone else was the only way I knew how to cope all right what are you here for anyway thought you already investigated this place I&amp;#39;d like to get your permission to climb up to the roof right up to That Hideous sign there he called it hideous oh is that all well go on ahead I know you&amp;#39;re a genius agent if you need to go up there then by all means Danny I&amp;#39;m not a genius I&amp;#39;m a complete failure don&amp;#39;t say that you work I never even gave a single thought to PJ Clarkson&amp;#39;s first daughter I was practically oblivious the entire I did figure out way before you did which is kind of funny never considered the possibility that Lena had a child either and that misstep cost us many sacrifices but you know all about it now right then just move on you figured out that it was Galina who murdered leas and that Galina was being manipulated by Lena you prove that my treasure wasn&amp;#39;t evil after all it may have cost us a lot of sacrifices but that still makes you a genius agent and that&amp;#39;s how I know I can trust you actually a good now I don&amp;#39;t care if you&amp;#39;re FBI I&amp;#39;m still going to come clean and say whoever killed my treasure is going to pay I want to track him down and kill him with my own hands but hand singular Clarks too so I made up my mind all Clarkson&amp;#39;s got a job to do yeah I noodles with the hand singular which one is it Zach Patricia must be in the boat house we saw in that photograph along with Melvin and Candy the goddess of fertility he said that was such spite what I saw at Alexis&amp;#39;s restaurant Not only was my mind still reeling but the Oracle was also rather vague but so what Zack we just need to find the same boat house that we saw we love this PNG like the water&amp;#39;s not even moving Singularity inside it Zack that&amp;#39;s the boat house it&amp;#39;s right where the photograph was taken but I have no idea how we&amp;#39;re supposed to reach it Zach it looks like we have no choice but to head back to the The Starting Line let&amp;#39;s go and see the one who fired the pistol at Heaven oh we get to go on a boat ride transport us straight to that boat house remember his love for justice is so strong that he chased a poacher&amp;#39;s boat all the way up the bou I&amp;#39;m sure he&amp;#39;ll be happy to help us he does kind of hate us though stop and just imagine it for a moment Chuck&amp;#39;s face once he hears that poacher&amp;#39;s boat is actually a shrine housing the goddess of fertility okay yes we see the sign what&amp;#39;s this interesting who left this message for her Zack you know what I forgot all about our 10-ft giant we still have a lot of work left to do in this town please no please I want to beat this tonight don&amp;#39;t say that don&amp;#39;t say that whatever you do don&amp;#39;t say that 10 hours later please don&amp;#39;t say that yeah we&amp;#39;ve been in this game for way too [ __ ] long see Z there&amp;#39;s the biggest man we&amp;#39;ve seen in town thus far let&amp;#39;s talk to him just in case who&amp;#39;s Justin hello there Avery I need your help would you mind raising your arms up high like this for me raise my arms like this thank you that&amp;#39;s perfect it appears that even with your height you&amp;#39;d have a tough time reaching a spot up that high I love Le

eliminate the cause of her death but I need your assistance if you ever see a man who looks taller and stronger than you I want you to let me know I will you bet I will where guy no no no not that way okay so the rental car thing is or the taxi service on the other side of this building I&amp;#39;m going to start trying to use that to cut down on time we&amp;#39;ve already been playing this for two hours and I feel like we&amp;#39;re still not close to the ending and I want to beat this tonight I bet speedruns for this game are [ __ ] terrible like absolutely terrible hold on I need to figure out where we&amp;#39;re headed first [Music] uh not the lake not the farm which way is it what&amp;#39;s was it the Thompson Farm I think it might be the Thompson Farm yeah cuz that&amp;#39;s Clark&amp;#39;s last name right it&amp;#39;s Clark Thompson yeah yeah yeah hello Chuck it&amp;#39;s pretty h of you it kind of does look like a rich kind of does you spoke of never even thought about that it&amp;#39;s good to see you though friend hopefully you&amp;#39;re doing well oh now he wants to catch the boat thought you FBI boys don&amp;#39;t chase down boats ain&amp;#39;t that what you said unless it&amp;#39;s a terrorist boat that plans to overthrow our country that is what he said you&amp;#39;re exactly right jack I discovered that boat does contain perpetrators who are potentially capable of overthrowing our country okay that&amp;#39;s a little bit of a stretch that that&amp;#39;s a little bit of a stretch perpetrators who are deeply connected to a new drug called s Rouge and you expect me to help you yes I need your help I see you got the balls to match just how big a goddamn prick you are about say he doesn&amp;#39;t really like us so poachers can [ __ ] with my form all they want but the moment drugs get involved all of a sudden you&amp;#39;re RAR to go do you have headaches almost every day guess what I don&amp;#39;t give a [ __ ] I can&amp;#39;t solve this case without your help chuck if you&amp;#39;re angry about how I acted earlier then please allow me to apologize I don&amp;#39;t want no apology sorry it&amp;#39;s okay it&amp;#39;s like life moves on then how can I get you to trust me you really don&amp;#39;t know when to shut up do you as you can see I&amp;#39;m busy here so if you&amp;#39;re done harassing me it&amp;#39;s good to see you friend hope for your Saturday stream you hi ell Chuck that was amazing Absol absolutely incredible fantastic how did you do that uh thanks I don&amp;#39;t know the answer lies in his physical advantage that&amp;#39;s it Zach your stance when you toss makes all the difference I can&amp;#39;t get over how beautiful his stance was just what am I missing you like skipping Stones you know I always trust a man who knows how to skip good I&amp;#39;ll be luring here enjoy friend y&amp;#39;all playing family see the key to skipping is how close your arm is to the water when you throw y&amp;#39;all also need accurate speed an accurate wrist snap and accurate timing when you let go that let&amp;#39;s do CU EV EV nice good [ __ ] that&amp;#39;s why short folk who stay low to the ground and keep a low profile like me can skip better and that&amp;#39;s how I reckon I can trust a man who knows what skipping all about got it you want my help oh I suck at this mini game I suck at this mini game dude Bubba Bubba&amp;#39;s my favorite character in that game I love Bubba we&amp;#39;re going save first yeah um I didn&amp;#39;t know what the deal was there and why he was like doing his stance without actually like facing the water it was interesting wait I didn&amp;#39;t even get a chance to do anything it just kind of went what this this this is this is [ __ ] you wait oh this m this mini game has never made any more sense never made any sense to me B I don&amp;#39;t know what it wants oh am I supposed to be pressing the button as it jumps that&amp;#39;s not how that works though like actual St skipping it&amp;#39;s all in the throw you don&amp;#39;t press the button as it&amp;#39;s jumping okay that&amp;#39;s really [ __ ] dumb that hurts my brain hot you&amp;#39;re a natural that was Flawless skipping all right really oh yeah you got talent boy and you&amp;#39;re humbled too well I did have a great teacher that&amp;#39;s what helped me to stay low yep that&amp;#39;s the key got to keep low profile folks can learn a lot about life from Stone skipping B&amp;#39;s got to stay humble keep himself from getting all arrogant you know what I mean okay my estro I trust you now I&amp;#39;ll take you into the swamp or wherever the hell else you want to go want to shove off now got to make while Sun let&amp;#39;s head over to my boat yeah that&amp;#39;s really dumb that that&amp;#39;s the way that that works that&amp;#39;s why all my throws doing the mini game before were just terrible because I was like I&amp;#39;m just like watch I I throw it and then I watch it and I&amp;#39;m like like huh that&amp;#39;s interesting like it just fails after I throw it no matter what I do we got to go B to get to your it ain&amp;#39;t the safest rout out there Z this is accelerating it&amp;#39;s like an amusement park ride only better my this is oh my God shut up just get to the point yeah I don&amp;#39;t think I&amp;#39;m ever buying that skin ever and I don&amp;#39;t think I&amp;#39;m ever spending more money on the game than just buying it yeah what what the [ __ ] is this [ __ ] why does everything have to be a [ __ ] mini game why do everything have to be a [ __ ] mini game in this ah why we don&amp;#39;t have to do this we can just take the boat ride right why do we have an on rail shooting section why okay I don&amp;#39;t controlling this on controller is hot ass controlling this on controller is so [ __ ] terrible and they think this was a switch exclusive so part of this was on joycons here think about that people were doing this [ __ ] on joycons and try and like then suffering okay this game is a [ __ ] mystery I&amp;#39;ll tell you what [ __ ] then sometimes you just have to reload which is weird what is this is so weird why can&amp;#39;t we just go why is everything in this game got to be 10 years long can we ever do anything in any timely manner in this video game or is it all have to be this big [ __ ] annoying it has to be a mini game it has to take 12 years to get it done brevity is the soul of wit as they say and this game did not understand that brother that I through it oh my God this camera is also making me [Music] nauseous miname Gore yeah everything&amp;#39;s got to be a [ __ ] mini game apparently thank you for the 15 bits though I don&amp;#39;t care just get me out of this first game is so much better than this because it didn&amp;#39;t didn&amp;#39;t have like 15 million mini games and every section didn&amp;#39;t take 10 million years you&amp;#39;re going to have to walk from here thanks Chuck hey you hear that winding winds howling that there&amp;#39;s a storm coming you better watch yourself out oh yeah folks don&amp;#39;t usually come around this in too much so be careful you got a weapon just give me AER if you wait for me to you I do always trust a good Skipper from the bottom of my heart I appreciate all your help okay HOH Silent Hill world&amp;#39;s back Zach a deadly Prim he said the name he said the name you feel about this one honestly I&amp;#39;m torn I know the truth that awaits us here isn&amp;#39;t one we want to accept but we have to keep marching ahead we&amp;#39;re FBI special agents remember the United States Department of Justice has authorized us to deliver Justice in their name you know sometimes I get to thinking why did I ever decide to work in the Justice sector you know the answer to that that&amp;#39;s covered in the first game because of you know the bad thing that happened to your mom you don&amp;#39;t want anything bad happening or you want to bring Justice for thing you know ill treatment of oh oh my reticle oh my reticle is breaking oh oh he&amp;#39;s breaking what is happening Brother what oh oh can I okay the the game&amp;#39;s just holy [ __ ] the game is just breaking the game is just [ __ ] breaking holy [ __ ] [ __ ] are you in [Music] pain yeah he somehow glitched outside the map and I couldn&amp;#39;t aim at him and my reticle was like could not figure out what was happening either that was yeah the first game describe like covers why he&amp;#39;s an FBI agent like pretty confirmed it&amp;#39;s cuz his mother was murdered so like he wants to bring Justice to people who you know Murder women that was pretty sternly covered in the first game so it&amp;#39;s weird that this game&amp;#39;s like gee sometimes I wonder why I&amp;#39;m an FBI agent it&amp;#39;s like you know why question mark it says they&amp;#39;re right on top of me but okay I guess it was supposed to be just like a cool throwaway line of like you know him reflecting but like you know it&amp;#39;s kind of just dumb considering that he like he knows why yeah they could have had him at least like mention his mother or something you know the fact that they don&amp;#39;t is really odd I want to see what brother why is that breaking sometimes that&amp;#39;s so bizar wait I&amp;#39;m out of bullets I&amp;#39;m I what what wait I don&amp;#39;t have any bullets what I&amp;#39;m out what oh do I just lose oh okay do I just have to run by everything now how do they not do anything okay guess I just run by stuff now what do I do for the boss fight then if I have to boss fight someone I&amp;#39;ll Cur you it&amp;#39;s weird Zach we&amp;#39;ve reached the final stage are you prepared for the truth h [Music] I love you I&amp;#39;ll do anything for you I&amp;#39;ll make your wish come true holy [ __ ] you stand before the goddess mind your manners oh heing his big boy voice sorry but I don&amp;#39;t worship that deity you always were a rud one Patty everything&amp;#39;s all right now just come over to me she can&amp;#39;t hear you York Patricia&amp;#39;s already in trance outside voices can&amp;#39;t reach her you didn&amp;#39;t son Rouge now what kind of foood do you take me for she&amp;#39;s the consecrated virgin and virgin to be pure she won&amp;#39;t be able to serve the godess if she gets all corrupted now will she and besides she&amp;#39;s got a resistance to the stuff might be due to the blood she inherited from her parents or might be son Rouge was designed that way on purpose not that it matters now cuz she&amp;#39;s about to die that gun that has no ammo I wouldn&amp;#39;t do that if I were you York or did you forget who gave you Mr allig to begin with you think I&amp;#39;d hand you a weapon without any sort of Safeguard in it this is straight out of a bad sea movie Melvin call it what you want York but I&amp;#39;m the main character here and you already played your part now that candi&amp;#39;s become the goddess I will take her once more and claim my seat as the king who rules this town yes I will be the one who rebuilds the Clarkson&amp;#39;s Legacy power isn&amp;#39;t important to you Melvin all you care about is your loving family remember the man who won the heart of the most beautiful girl in the world Melvin Woods we can still stop this from happening you just need to wake up Melvin he&amp;#39;s trying so y you really are a second rate man that&amp;#39;s just you&amp;#39;re incapable of understanding how other f feel Lena was the one I loved candy is nearly the symbol we use to restore the Clarkson&amp;#39;s Glory the goddess of fertility is just an idol designed to guide our people down the proper path I devoted everything I had to Lena hey Patricia a I was obsessed with Lena ever since I was a kid she lived in a big mansion and also had skin as white as snow all I ever wanted was to be just like her my friends were too close minded to understand don&amp;#39;t let the white man brainwash you they said but race was never a part of it for me she was always far above that [ __ ] a higher being who surpassed it all by the time I grew up she already changed forms and abandoned her home at first I was so shocked it felt like my dreams had been shattered before I ever got a chance to pursue them when I finally got a chance to meet her face to face everything changed I loved her female form with all my heart the moment I saw her again she completely possessed my soul hey you know how they say God created man in his own image that&amp;#39;s what Lena is she&amp;#39;s God&amp;#39;s finest creation the Perfection of the human race what is happening she wasn&amp;#39;t perfect in any way Melvin she was just another criminal who happened to be a bit smarter than most Town bad no kidding you never understand any I decided to follow her plan and so I became the one who supported her from the Shadows working to fulfill her dream of restoring the clar and&amp;#39;s glory that&amp;#39;s why I seduced candy married her and kept giving her son Rouge whenever Lena told me to then you know what happened about one year ago we finally saw a sign a sign of the birth of the goddess of fertility you mean she started growing horribly obese gosh 8 years it fell long but also short somehow I knew from the start that much blood would be spilled but I had no other choice it was the only way for me to make my beloved angel need me so you murdered Galina too yeah that didn&amp;#39;t exactly go according to plan Galina was supposed to kill leas and Lena was supposed to take life then Lena and Galina were supposed to kill PJ and in their own lives filicide patricide and suicide these three types of sacrifice were going to complete the blood Purge I don&amp;#39;t remember that uh that movie there&amp;#39;s a lot of purge movies though so maybe I missed it you came to town you&amp;#39;re

totally appropriate Katrina brought that rain to us and now I realized that at the very end saw hurricane kri has a canonical event in this game but she washed all that away every last trace this game is so weird oh not him how&amp;#39;s game hey dusk it&amp;#39;s um it&amp;#39;s interesting to say the least it&amp;#39;s very interesting it&amp;#39;s a game all right yep it is indeed a game of all time yep there&amp;#39;s one more chapter wow s ranking that&amp;#39;s amazing oh it&amp;#39;s the song I just love the look of glistening green grass green I&amp;#39;m talking about moist with sprinkler water reflecting the radience of the Sun in that regard Louisiana&amp;#39;s grass is in a class of its own just picture it on a clear summer day a c in one hand gazing out from your porch onto the garden you&amp;#39;re so proud of this and yeah we missed you whistle song combination they go hand in hand just like hot dogs and sporting events but that grass it&amp;#39;s got a bit of a nerve to it it doesn&amp;#39;t matter how many you cut it down it&amp;#39;ll always keep coming back and turn your eyes away for a bit and that&amp;#39;s when it&amp;#39;ll really Sprout up up until last week your garden was perfectly pruned and balanced what the [ __ ] is happening in the background PR but you wake up the next morning and you can&amp;#39;t even stand to look at what it&amp;#39;s become that&amp;#39;s why people work so hard to cut their grass I have a neighbor in my neighborhood that takes their lawn this [ __ ] seriously it&amp;#39;s very weird it&amp;#39;s very weird and end if you want to stop cutting your grass you need to either submit to his growth or force it to wither that&amp;#39;s all humans can really do hard work never really gets walk is very important you following me here just be honest with yourself be honest Francis Zack Morgan full named [Music] him why are you [Music] here oh howdy Zach so we meet again I never want to see again touching reunion

about you&amp;#39;ve been watching him for four and a half years haven&amp;#39;t you can you really stand here and tell me that you never saw a single one of the strange signs I&amp;#39;m picking up on now what signs deadly premonitions yeah they said it again preparations for kid in or terrorist activities sexual depravity violent tendencies self-mutilation or even just contacting a specific person periodically nope NADA he doesn&amp;#39;t fit any of that you think I&amp;#39;d really ignore something that obvious I may be a schlub but I&amp;#39;m still an FBI agent yeah she really doesn&amp;#39;t respect you then why didn&amp;#39;t you do anything about this room or did you merely choose to ignore his abnormal proclivities you want to know what I did I did my damn job end of story I was outside the entire time how do you expect me to notice a room like this from out there it&amp;#39;s as simple as that yeah she&amp;#39;s being really unfair to you at least it was until you dragged me into this whole mess don&amp;#39;t blame me just because your big investigation ended up leading nowhere you got her there then tell me the truth after seeing this room can you really say that man is in his right mind he kept this room a total secret from you for over four and years no normal human is capable of such a feat I don&amp;#39;t know about a true genius or a true monster I don&amp;#39;t know about that I think you&amp;#39;re going too much you really guarantee that he won&amp;#39;t try anything if we just let him go here well the law doesn&amp;#39;t work though need to help me find some sort of evidence that we can use to make him reveal what he&amp;#39;s plotting okay okay why do you think Jethro here survived why I mean doesn&amp;#39;t he look like the kind of guy who die first in a horror movie he married into the Clarkson family he didn&amp;#39;t possess Clarkson blood so he had nothing to do with Helen ad Doan&amp;#39;s plan the blood Purge thing but if that was all there was to it then Helena do for reason but Clarkson&amp;#39;s right yet a ton of the Clarks and gang members died along with Sheriff Woods doesn&amp;#39;t up she did whatever it took to achieve her goals she&amp;#39;d kill if the plan required it but killing people outside of the Clarkson family was never a priority her ultimate goal was to cut off the Clarkson bloodline maybe he was always meant to be an assistant to the goddess of fertility what like a servant he was the kind of person who was most in his element when he had someone to serve even afterwards he let Patricia take over the estate while he became her assistant oh oh as soon as he settled into his role the town&amp;#39;s people started to respect him now they practically rever him and he&amp;#39;s even earned himself a nickname one arm Danny so you think his life played out exactly the way Professor R planned it to go talk about tragic as long as he was Happ afterwards I was so positive but she isn&amp;#39;t here there is something about this room though agent Jones what do you think me I&amp;#39;m not as smart as you why are you even asking me are you hiding something of course not knock it off me hiding something that&amp;#39;s a good one come on I got nothing to hide you&amp;#39;re a little you&amp;#39;re overselling it a little bit bud I thought I would find answers in this room I thought that Patricia would be here but I was wrong this room is only filled with photos of people related to the case and the handiwork of a mad man feels like I&amp;#39;m wandering through a heavy mist why is Morgan showcasing those women&amp;#39;s photos and that bad if you loved someone from the bottom of your heart would you ever be able to marry someone else or kill for them these are Big questions to ask for this hokey ass game whoa uh big questions to ask for a hoke ass game like this I never heard of any kind of motive like that in any other murder case I just keep feeling like we&amp;#39;re being fed a story that he made up in his mind true honestly without having experienced what that&amp;#39;s like I can&amp;#39;t really say what I do but I&amp;#39;d never try and force love to happen if it didn&amp;#39;t seem like it was meant to be there are 3.5 billion women on this planet there&amp;#39;s got to be more than one specific person who anyone can fall deeply in love with right this is really te for [ __ ] this game just does this this game just does it sometimes the first game did this too it just randomly gets really deep and thoughtful for like no reason and you&amp;#39;re just like what the [ __ ] I&amp;#39;ve been listening to them talking about like Ghostbusters and like Hokey ass [ __ ] for like [ __ ] 3 hours and now we&amp;#39;re talking about like soul mates and the one and being able What depths will you go to for somebody you love like what the what is the what are these video games but what if we were talking about pizza not women and then we&amp;#39;re back we&amp;#39;re back to the hook you just discovered the perfect ultimate pizza but you aren&amp;#39;t allowed to take even a single bite unless you kill someone for the cook holy [ __ ] Have You Ever Loved Someone with all your heart that scared me think it my B but that scared me that scared me you got a little pop scare out of me thank you what kind of person do you take me for that&amp;#39;s my line the one who took her in after the incident was Daniel Clarkson the next in line to succeed the Clarkson family he&amp;#39;s the one that ended up raising her from that point onwards Matt starting enjoy your match dusk good luck isn&amp;#39;t fate Strange In the End two people who were completely unrelated by Blood ended up inheriting that house yeah you&amp;#39;re right but sometimes I wonder what is family anyway go back far enough we&amp;#39;re all strangers to one another we&amp;#39;re talking countless Generations marriages and birth you know humans love to deify the rules they create it&amp;#39;s almost like that&amp;#39;s been an unwritten law from the very start [Music] [Music] why did leas have to die first is that a dead squirrel what the [ __ ] what is this oh you got to be kidding me this room paints such a bizarre picture but upon closer look I can see some strange sort of pattern to it all was Morgan trying to recreate something with all this if so there must be a reason for all of these weird and hideous things yeah those up there are interesting what&amp;#39;s that PJ hunting trophy a brown bear with a dragonfly ey patch why is it smoking a cigar it&amp;#39;s probably supposed to represent Philip J Clarkson&amp;#39;s body and the elk is Helena doen so that&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s got such good taste she&amp;#39;s an elk Dome that one wasn&amp;#39;t lost on me and this one is Galina Clarkson why did he want to line up corpses that were killed in different places all together in a single room good question red C when Helena doen returned home someone must have let her inside you think that was her brother-in-law Daniel I don&amp;#39;t know well alligators did Chomp his arm off he probably had it in for old man PJ too but you know I don&amp;#39;t think he had anything to do with this why not you&amp;#39;re making it out to be more complicated than it really is that&amp;#39;s not good reasoning that&amp;#39;s always the problem with people like you too smart for your own good just get to the point Professor R marched straight through the front door to the mansion she arrived right at her destination using the quickest route possible without having to undergo a single Security check I know my question is how was she able to do that because she&amp;#39;s family it doesn&amp;#39;t matter if PJ disowned her he never stopped loving his son daughter a father would never abandon his child no matter how much they fail to fulfill his expectations I wish that was the case but unfortunately in real life that&amp;#39;s not really how it works that&amp;#39;s what being a parent is all about yeah unfortunately a lot of that falls through don&amp;#39;t look at me like that I know I know I don&amp;#39;t have a son myself but I have a father he&amp;#39;s still back in my hometown managing the printing plant my grandfather started he&amp;#39;ll be turning 80s soon he wanted me to take over the place but as you can see I&amp;#39;m out here but I know how this whole thing works even though I haven&amp;#39;t seen him in Forever the minute I go home he&amp;#39;ll welcome me with warm Open Arms Galina Clarkson went to California to become an actress but things never took off for her so she eventually returned home then she murdered her own daughter and ended up like this where did she go wrong she did manage to appear in a few movies right not as any characters with actual names and never with much clo on what&amp;#39;s wrong with that Aaliyah what&amp;#39;s that supposed to mean what is that a bad thing huh so that&amp;#39;s the only value they saw in her huh sorry hey Simon what the [ __ ] I was what&amp;#39;s wrong with that [ __ ] you two [ __ ] the both of you what&amp;#39;s wrong with that it&amp;#39;s an everyday occurrence in that world she was also bullied a lot bullied how they&amp;#39;d cut up her costumes her scripts and even her own clothes everywhere she went then after 3 years of that her stylist chopped off a chunk of her hair by accident are you kidding me I did a little investigating on this in the end a self-titled Big Cheese producer tricked her she almost ended up going into porn it what&amp;#39;s wrong with that you guys are you two are awful not hard to imagine what would have happened after that she may have been successful [ __ ] both of y&amp;#39;all one witness said that after returning to Lu car she refused to use scissors to cut anything uh you sure it&amp;#39;s okay to press that won&amp;#39;t know until we try well that turned off the music hey it&amp;#39;s woodst shut up look a peace sign upside down peace sign love and peace man stop Simon even I can figure out what this is from it&amp;#39;s Jimmy hendris Janice choplin Grateful Dead Leed Zeppelin but I shouldn&amp;#39;t have to explain it to a music nut like you right that isn&amp;#39;t a Pac Mark it&amp;#39;s upside down you don&amp;#39;t need to be a music nut to see that what who says that&amp;#39;s the top part if you&amp;#39;re looking from Lisa&amp;#39;s head this is the top part making it a big fat Peace Mark no this is the ground where&amp;#39;s your proof this is like the six of the nine argument the red seeds seeds go in the ground right that makes this wall the bottom Lisa&amp;#39;s head is clearly at the top also agent Jones Leed Zeppelin never played at Woodstock tell him he&amp;#39;s representing a human with a hunting trophy made from an animal I feel like I&amp;#39;m looking at a piece of Modern Art done in really bad taste she plan a string of murders all in order to restore the Clarkson to their former glory right yeah according to Morgan&amp;#39;s story matches up with the files too but the only proof of that is the confession she privately gave to Morgan just before she died Galina Clarkson was also murdered immediately after she confessed don&amp;#39;t you think it&amp;#39;s all a little too convenient well storywise yeah and the sacrifices none of the FBI&amp;#39;s official records contain an example of an actual Human Sacrifice aside from the cases that Francis Zack Morgan handled that is there are tons of examples of animal sacrifice though and remember the witch hunts back in the Middle Ages got you there meaning meaning there are always exceptions to the rule and Morgan alluded to the existence of some sort of Journal right I think he said he read it in Professor R&amp;#39;s lab if we could find that maybe this would all become easier to swallow the report didn&amp;#39;t mention anything about a journal and if it truly did exist it surely would have been submitted as evidence unless he tried to cover it up on purpose or unless the journal never existed in the first place exactly it was in the Silent Hill world so probably doesn&amp;#39;t actually exist he was taught how to rule as a child never confided in anyone and married for purely political reasons that&amp;#39;s rough buddy then he prospered so much that he became powerful enough to rule an entire town on his own but in the end his own child betrayed him and ended his entire clan in a series of violent deaths if that was your life how would you look back on it not well beats me I wasn&amp;#39;t born into a rich family nor was I ever taught how to rule and for what it&amp;#39;s worth I&amp;#39;ve also never knocked up a young ex- actress but I guess we can say is that any good life needs balance get too hung up on one thing and you lose sight of everything else and if you betray someone you&amp;#39;ll get betrayed too someone thinks they can step all over people and then live out the rest of their life in peace they&amp;#39;re fooling themselves a lot more people get away with that than you think lot more people get away with that than you think I wish I wish oh that is not the case we always get to see how those people end up in our line of work in the end they die horrible deaths that is why Pizza is the only thing I trust Pizza never betrays you uh it can it can hurt your stomach later not true not factual especially if you&amp;#39;re lactose intolerant this case took place in luar and sent it around the Clarkson press of authority cross purposes Madness and love but Katrina took the truth along with many innocent lives and buried it all at the bottom of the swamp but there&amp;#39;s one truth that can never be washed away this all started with the death of a young girl everyone thinks that the principal thing to the tree is the fruit but in point of fact the principal thing to it is the seed I got chicken in the egg argument now I know why Le Clarkson was murdered first Lisa&amp;#39;s death was Professor R having second thoughts according to Morgan her plan was to perform paraside and filicide then commit suicide those were the three deaths necessary to complete the ritual remember which means she technically could have killed Patricia first that would have been the best way to delay any interference from the Clarkson themselves the reason she didn&amp;#39;t kill Patricia first is because Lena was actually following a different plan inside her own mind or perhaps she merely changed her plan as she followed through with it at some point new emotion started to take root within her she had second thoughts about something and in order to shake those off she used Galina to kill lease first in order to cut off any possible Escape but that only made her plan move ahead quicker than she could have ever imagined which forced her to rush right up to the end with those misgivings always in the back of her mind huh wait s&amp;#39;s like wait wait wait wait yeah you lost me what you talking about in other words at some point Helena doen decided that she wanted to make Patricia the next Heir the blood Purge wasn&amp;#39;t for the goddess of fertility it was for their daughter Patricia wait are you saying Helena knew from the start that sheriff Woods would die with candy that&amp;#39;s the only explanation I can think of huh remember this is only assuming that everything Morgan told us was true until I can trust that man this is all nothing more than conjecture considering how insane this all is it sounds perfectly he&amp;#39;s like compared to everything we heard so far that&amp;#39;s plausible [Music] Francis hello ah snake H cut got your T why do you have to have a snake man good thing it&amp;#39;s just a [ __ ] model you know why I&amp;#39;m here don&amp;#39;t you surely you must know what this means to commemorate our reunion allow me to give you another Oracle the contract once signed will last for eternity but only in the presence of true love why is your arm sticking through your snake did you hear that I like how they could animate the snake literally at all it is literally just a problem it&amp;#39;s been a while since I there it is you know there&amp;#39;s hardly anyone in this era who can see me like you can and they&amp;#39;ve been dropping like flies since you first came to see me sorry about that breaks my heart [Music] we don&amp;#39;t have much time yeah so get on with it do you have any questions for [Music] me excellent you pass you haven&amp;#39;t changed Francis Zach Morgan but that question isn&amp;#39;t for me to answer well then why did you let me ask it go and see it with your own eyes that&amp;#39;s just a non answer time up we&amp;#39;ll have to finish this during our next reunion I didn&amp;#39;t help at all sure didn&amp;#39;t what is this music how&amp;#39;s the case going almost done I would hope we&amp;#39;re on the last chapter this is bad it&amp;#39;s good to see you though Nord jaian Target Target escaped with hostage whereabouts unknown agent Jones what is this referring to Avery Smith kidnapped Patricia Clarkson and escaped Avery the big dude Avery Smith the vault manager why would he kidnap Patricia tell me what&amp;#39;s going on right now well answer me Jones I made a deal with Morgan back when he took me to the bathroom what what Morgan said something he&amp;#39;s awake by the way if we want to find Patricia we need to look at Avery Smith have you lost your mind what he said made sense ever since 2005 Aver&amp;#39;s been working deep inside that cold storage Warehouse he was also arrested in the past for getting too friendly with Lee Clarkson and after Katrina he apparently worked on renovating the warehouse for free what if that allowed him to freely modify the warehouse as he pleased that would explain why her body remained missing for 14 whole years then I did a little check and found out that he never went back to work after Christmas Vacation ended so what why would you trust him uh I don&amp;#39;t I just decided it was worth investigating that&amp;#39;s all like a good FBI agent does so I sent two agents to Avery&amp;#39;s house without telling anyone I just called in a favor from an old friend in the New Orleans branch no one gave you clearance for that you think you can just but what if Morgan he&amp;#39;s doing a better job than you are if he is we&amp;#39;re both going to look like total clowns clowns who went barging into a former agent&amp;#39;s house on completely unfounded suspicions he&amp;#39;s right HQ will have a field day with us they&amp;#39;ll string us up as the two dumbest agents to have ever graced the field I just wanted to take some precautions he&amp;#39;s not wrong and besides if he is lying it&amp;#39;s still no skin off our backs right if things work out we&amp;#39;ll end up solving a difficult case that&amp;#39;s been driving everyone crazy imagine that you and me just the two of us you and I I&amp;#39;ll be able to jump ship on this crappy job and you&amp;#39;ll be able to freely investigate all things San Rouge just like you&amp;#39;ve always wanted besides you know that Morgan is director Abraham&amp;#39;s favorite even if we get into some sort of trouble if Morgan testifies to Abraham&amp;#39;s Forest will totally be in the clear I don&amp;#39;t care this isn&amp;#39;t the way things are supposed to be done well I&amp;#39;m sorry but I had no other choice you were so engrossed in this and come on you know how he&amp;#39;s right you weren&amp;#39;t willing to listen to The Reason besides saving the hostage should take priority above all else there&amp;#39;s no time for squabbling exactly we need to find Avery Smith no matter what it takes but how uh well thanks to your heroic Maneuvers we just lost our suspect I know but I know how to find him be able to see the other world the way I am now just let me go please Morgan it&amp;#39;s okay my fairy I know I can convince them buing rat corpse yeah that&amp;#39;s I don&amp;#39;t have much time left I hope he doesn&amp;#39;t me like in his life I&amp;#39;m pretty sure that&amp;#39;s why I can see the other world now is he going to die had lost that sense ever since the greenvil incident but it&amp;#39;s back now I hope not please will you just trust me come on Simon you&amp;#39;ll trust me won&amp;#39;t you uh what no agent Jones remember the warning I gave you at the very beginning still she&amp;#39;s fighting it dude you can&amp;#39;t let him take control of the conversation yeah I I know I know you think she would have learned after how deep we are into the story but she&amp;#39;s still not please halia Davis let me go this is our case to finish no you aren&amp;#39;t an agent anymore but you don&amp;#39;t know how to find him neither of you ever could oh I&amp;#39;ll find him yeah that tell him I swear on my pride as an active agent that I won&amp;#39;t give up until I do oh your Pride&amp;#39;s going to solve it huh that won&amp;#39;t get you anywhere I agree it&amp;#39;s beyond you hi Emily tiny Emily shut up you think we can&amp;#39;t find him but you can just how stupid do you think we are if you want us to believe you then it&amp;#39;s about time you showed us some proof if your story is true then why did Avery Smith kidnap Patricia Patricia resembles leas I even got them confused once and Lease reported being stalked by a 10-foot man that&amp;#39;s Avery Smith exactly but he&amp;#39;s only 67 at best only 67 his physical characteristics don&amp;#39;t match the person you&amp;#39;re talking about I once concluded the very same thing but now I know that was is definitely Avery he protected Lisa&amp;#39;s body for the past 14 years until you discovered his Sleeping Beauty so after losing Lisa&amp;#39;s body he kidnapped Patricia as a replacement that&amp;#39;s ridiculous is that really what you think happened even if Avery did possess that sort of mentality it doesn&amp;#39;t make sense if lease was really that important him he would have tried to steal her back not now maybe but certainly after she was buried would you be able to go on worshiping a goddess who had been defiled by so many hands that ice was a barrier a shield that separated the Divine from our world hey B your hypothesis was pretty much on the mark last week I went back to lucar then I bought a used car and got on a train in Trenton but not for the reason you think I wasn&amp;#39;t stalking Patricia and I never triy to kidnap her then why would you go there why would you risk so much especially since you knew that she were under surveillance because once again I&amp;#39;m chasing son Rouge son Rouge even after I quit the FBI I continued to study the red trees on my own and now I&amp;#39;ve come to the conclusion that those red seeds and S Rouge both come from the same Roots I also found proof that someone&amp;#39;s inherited the original recipe that&amp;#39;s why I flew to lucari to confirm my suspicions but I was more powerless than I ever could have imagined I couldn&amp;#39;t move like I used to no badge no gun so after wandering aimlessly around town I swallowed down my torment and my weakness and left really sad you expect me to believe that I know you&amp;#39;ve got it in you what&amp;#39;s that supposed to mean you found leas Clarkson&amp;#39;s body the one thing I never did and only a few days after discovering the body you came to visit me you should be fully capable of discerning that what I&amp;#39;m telling you is the truth talking much about oneself can also be a means to conce steal oneself n woo shut the [ __ ] up God you&amp;#39;re so obnoxious you can&amp;#39;t trick me well Patty was kidnapped I [Music] thought if she was kidnapped by the time that he was there then like obviously that&amp;#39;s not a thing you said that someone inherited the S Rouge recipe didn&amp;#39;t you is that someone Avery Smith it has to be Avery used to help Professor R do research in secret what well that wasn&amp;#39;t in the report I only realized it just now the moment I spilled my coffee on the floor Ah that&amp;#39;s right that did happen Avery revealed that he was helping with some sort of research but at the time I let his confession go in one ear yeah he said mean science lady says you&amp;#39;re not allowed in here now that I look back on it I realize it was solid proof that he was helping her produce son Rouge what makes you think that he had free access to the deepest parts of the cold storage Warehouse oh wait meaning Sal Rouge needs to be produced in an extremely cold environment exactly Aaliyah Davis you already considered this possibility didn&amp;#39;t you that&amp;#39;s why you investigated the cold storage Warehouse as soon as you got to lucari in order to locate where son Rouge was being made then you came across Lisa&amp;#39;s Body by pure chance who do you think benefited most from the green Bale case no one benefited from it many lives were lost that&amp;#39;s all you really believe that everyone who survived was overcome with sadness scarred for life so sad man without exception without exception isn&amp;#39;t that right my fairy I feel like you&amp;#39;re the one person who benefited from the case well he he lost probably his best shot at like settling down with someone you were able to add a new chapter to your stunning career and earned unshakable trust from the chief that&amp;#39;s what allows you to go on using his Intel Network as you please even though you&amp;#39;re retired Are you seriously suggesting I&amp;#39;m with him what the [ __ ] man sickness is destroying my body I feel like I&amp;#39;m on the verge of losing my mind yet somehow I&amp;#39;m unable to forget the cases connected to those seeds whittling down what&amp;#39;s left of my life chasing them you really think I&amp;#39;m doing all this for nothing but self-interest gosh that that&amp;#39;s a very dumb accusation is that really what you&amp;#39;re saying cuz she didn&amp;#39;t she can&amp;#39;t even say anything about that she&amp;#39;s like Melvin wasn&amp;#39;t the fool King what many different characters pop up in Lena&amp;#39;s journal and I mistook one of them for someone else what are you talking about after Simon hit me and I fainted I had a dream now I&amp;#39;m convinced I&amp;#39;m the fool King the fool King was always meant to be an outsider who suddenly arrived in lucari and the man she felt the need to eliminate wasn&amp;#39;t me but Avery Lena realized her plan was on the verge of falling apart she also guessed that I would be able to save Patricia from Melvin the one worry that remained in her heart was leaving Patricia behind and how her life would play out from that point on especially since she would be left behind with Avery a large childlike man who&amp;#39;s Beyond anyone&amp;#39;s control she wrote that journal entry hoping that I the fool king would be capable of stopping Avery and she wrote it in a specific way in order to try and Rouse me to action Lena and Melvin both entrusted me with their daughter so please just let me go it&amp;#39;s my d Dy to protect her Aaliyah&amp;#39;s smart she&amp;#39;s Top Class even within the FBI she must understand that what I&amp;#39;m saying makes sense problem is that she&amp;#39;s too smart the way she is now she&amp;#39;ll refuse to accept anything that can yeah she&amp;#39;s not been doing well so far with that I understand what you&amp;#39;re trying to say but it&amp;#39;s too perfect it&amp;#39;s too perfect just like that report of yours how could you come to such a detailed conclusion after spending years shut up in this room it doesn&amp;#39;t make sense the only possible explanation is that you&amp;#39;re bending the narrative in the direction you wanted to go why do you think I left the field for two years after greenvil that case cost me not only my best friend but also my special talent poor are you Zach I&amp;#39;m going said you but poor Zach I never thought I&amp;#39;d lose something like that but ever since then I&amp;#39;ve been unable to solve cases using that method metaphysical offender profiling I tried everything I could think of to regain my lost talent but it never came back to me that&amp;#39;s why I quit working for the FBI and without anywhere else to go I simply spent my days seeking truth searching for an answer I&amp;#39;d never find it was bad for him man so time continued to cruy pass me by until finally the disease started eating away at my body why does he look different so this game is both a prequel and a sequel so all the stuff that we&amp;#39;re playing before is the prequel and it ALS there&amp;#39;s also a bit that takes place in 2019 uh which is a technically a sequel so this is his old version of himself I thought it was all over for me but about half a year ago I finally reached my conclusion everything started with the red seeds he and I encountered these seeds long before we reached greenvil under the seething mind melting we got you&amp;#39;re in the sou then for some reason the beginning of December I finally regained my talent and instantly I could see the other world again get it through allowing the cancer cells to ravage my body I regained the power to travel to the other side cuz he&amp;#39;s close to death this is the only answer Aaliyah Davis truth is a surprise born from coincidence and unknown power H her with the N she&amp;#39;s like [ __ ] don&amp;#39;t do that to me I made a promise with Melvin he entrusted me with Patricia all he had left but immediately after you solved the case you sent her to the Clarks slap forehead that&amp;#39;s just rude isn&amp;#39;t that right you let go of her a long long time ago so you have no right to step back into the picture now that was the wrong thing to do I was young but now I have the chance to write my wrong you can&amp;#39;t be serious you can barely stand up hey Aaliyah I know agent Jones I know I&amp;#39;m stepping over the line here I just want to make it clear that we can&amp;#39;t trust a word of what he says she was the first perpetrator in the case and technically she was also why this is weird is cuz it&amp;#39;s not really like a who done it kind of like the first game is because like it&amp;#39;s more about the cult&amp;#39;s ultimate goal and not like ask her now but maybe the Mur really did love her daughter with all her heart and so she was afraid afraid of what would happen if her daughter did end up up inheriting the Clarkson estate It Was Fear or something like it that&amp;#39;s what L the red tree inside that&amp;#39;s still no reason to kill someone especially not your own daughter I know of course I know that and I&amp;#39;m sure that deep down she did too two bizarre cases derailed your life must have been been extremely painful you have my deepest condolences but that doesn&amp;#39;t put you in the clear you&amp;#39;re still a suspect her people her people a suspect for what Patricia isn&amp;#39;t here the murders of sheriff Melvin woods and Candy Woods their bodies were never recovered interesting Katrina carried them away along with many other lives aside from that report you wrote there&amp;#39;s nothing that proves your innocence hey let&amp;#39;s not jump to conclusions here oh I&amp;#39;m not I also suspect there&amp;#39;s a possibility that he murdered individuals connected to other cases that he&amp;#39;s worked on the greenvil report Bears the same inconsistencies as this one and both cases are filled with victims whose deaths were never witnessed no there were plenty of witness deaths in the first game what are you talking about stop don&amp;#39;t say another word if you so much as mention her name oh oh don&amp;#39;t do

trust me that&amp;#39;s where Patricia Clarkson is trust you where&amp;#39;s your proof ask Aaliyah Davis ask her about the name of the person who tipped her off what do you mean you&amp;#39;re from Chicago and you love pizza right especially deep dish pizza deep dish is pretty low tier for me not going to lie but it&amp;#39;s still Pizza it&amp;#39;s still good what does this have to do with pizza just ask her and ask her why she decided to take this case in the first place got it Pizza sometimes I feel like with Deep D it feels like I&amp;#39;m just biting into a tomato so you need to trust it doesn&amp;#39;t really taste like pizza to me you know it&amp;#39;s too much of one thing but how could you have known that I would come here with her I didn&amp;#39;t I just bet on you God

tell Abrahams to prepare a private jet for me at the airport I know Robert won&amp;#39;t turn his back on me wait Morgan are you serious the chief would never out a private jet to a civilian part of the game you&amp;#39;re on I&amp;#39;m trying to get to the ending this is the last chapter I have to leave you for a bit my fairy they&amp;#39;ll be fine they&amp;#39;ll figure it all out York can you hear me I&amp;#39;m going to go finish the job you started hey that makes us even okay it&amp;#39;s like a fairy it&amp;#39;s uh your I&amp;#39;ll expain a minute is a genius agent she&amp;#39;s probably going to end up being an even better agent than we were she just needs more experience under her belt she&amp;#39;s still only pursuing the world she can see with her naked eye she needs to experience more frustration she needs to strengthen herself on the other hand Simon&amp;#39;s much smarter than he looks no wonder he was able to go on watching us for four and a half years all that struggling under the surface paid off in the end do you want to know why he decided to start trusting me it&amp;#39;s simple it&amp;#39;s all because of the name I used to send the tip to the FBI it&amp;#39;s the name of that pizza parlor the Chicago style place with those trademarked Crimson boxes Franklin&amp;#39;s kitchen FK yet again they&amp;#39;ve got the best deep dish pizza in the area both Simon and I love that place that&amp;#39;s why I told him Pizza will never betray you at York man he made it all the way down to Louisiana in 5 hours oh look at him his a little that&amp;#39;s like a giant Leon [Music] jacket York it&amp;#39;s almost time this is the part of game I&amp;#39;ve been waiting for the whole time to be honest finish this I&amp;#39;ll be there soon watch my back will you this is going to be my final battle so I&amp;#39;m this far gone huh but unlike 14 years ago I feel more at home in this world [Music] now we still have zero bullets and now we can&amp;#39;t now we can&amp;#39;t like we could never buy them either we could only like like is it am I like I feel like that&amp;#39;s not how things are supposed to be oh I have a bunch in my [ __ ] store box did I just run out of inventory maybe we have literally 47 of those yeah I think the game just bugged and just like removed my rubber bullets from my from my inventory or something yeah I think the game just kind of bugged and removed him from my inventory for some reason probably leave our medkits never ended up using like half of this stuff all right 700 bullets good oh we can they were just red apparitions before now you can actually see them it&amp;#39;s interesting don&amp;#39;t that even affected him I want yeah that&amp;#39;s I was so confused about I&amp;#39;ve been picking up rubber bullets like the entire game like more than I use more than I intake so I was always I was confused as to how I had supposedly run out of ammo yeah I was confused out how I had supposedly run out of ammo when I&amp;#39;ve been picking up bullets the entire game that&amp;#39;s weird we&amp;#39;ve unlocked two of these now usually only one of the red vine doors is there&amp;#39;s only usually one red vine door that leads directly where we need to go yeah so I don&amp;#39;t know what what&amp;#39;s up with this then that was kind of sneaky to put that guy there so like the crabs would come after me while I was in a corner oh my gosh what the hell they were hiding on the ceiling holy moly I did not see that coming well that&amp;#39;s something that&amp;#39;s certainly unique there&amp;#39;s so many of these oh God there&amp;#39;s a one of the weird ladies in here they are odd yeah I&amp;#39;ve been picking up rubber bullets the whole game oh okay we ended up going the right way it&amp;#39;s honestly fine by me gosh they always get me they&amp;#39;re pretty devilish the way they just I I wonder if you can see them up there like if you enter a room can you look up and see them beforehand or is it just kind of like they just like spawn in and fall on you I&amp;#39;m intrigued to know oh interesting back in the freezer place but in the other world oh this is another in between area I see hello hey KJ how&amp;#39;s it going how are you friend how your weaken shooting you should do a slaughter house hopefully it won&amp;#39;t be my slaughter house but someone else&amp;#39;s ah I thought those were boxes don&amp;#39;t laugh at me you can see them up there I saw her last second yeah you can see them up there yes so look there she is you can spot him mhm need to keep an eye out for that now yep there she is I&amp;#39;m like looking up now I&amp;#39;m like nervous what&amp;#39;s keep giving me coffee well that&amp;#39;s supposed to help me oh jeez she is taking all this ammo well H please don&amp;#39;t no let go of it okay so that dead ends so that&amp;#39;s not the way we were supposed to go okay we can&amp;#39;t go that way yet through here well that wasn&amp;#39;t very it wasn&amp;#39;t very thoughtful of them I didn&amp;#39;t think that through oh I dodge you can&amp;#39;t Dodge while reloading fun fact found that out at the very end of the game somebody&amp;#39;s right behind me yeah that&amp;#39;s one of the weird ladies oh that that is me being locked in place by the way for that long that&amp;#39;s not me just standing there the game actually locks me in place for that long after uh after that little Vine cut scene while she was right there why shoot the cute lady you that&amp;#39;s cute to you so she&amp;#39;s trying to kill me is the answer listen oh [ __ ] good thing I have a bunch of these down here how&amp;#39;s your stream Reaper I was working in your it in spontaneous day stream uh but obviously I had to stream myself at a certain point hopefully it the rest of it end up going well you would have been proud did you clip it oh my gosh that&amp;#39;s what I get for reading chat no but I can&amp;#39;t do it I love that [ __ ] people do that to people send me they&amp;#39;re Zeno Eclipse it just feels nice I&amp;#39;m just like Yay I&amp;#39;m the homie they want to show that stuff too you could even say I&amp;#39;m a xen s and hey if we beat this game quick enough I will uh we may do that it just depends how much of the game is left we may play some do anym go for tail attack stuff want to usually stream for uh I always aim for like 5 to six hours but sometimes I go way over like yesterday I didn&amp;#39;t end up doing eight hours kind it just depends yeah don&amp;#39;t release the killer crabs please yeah I try to do barely long streams although I I definitely also try not to really overdo it at the same time [Music] I&amp;#39;ll watch that when I can I really do want to try to get to the end of this game as quick as I can cuz this has been a three- we playthrough so far and I want to end it that way yeah I&amp;#39;m not going to definitely not getting used to that what think she&amp;#39;s think she bugged out there for a second she got stuck in her little attack animation and just stood there oh there&amp;#39;s another one there&amp;#39;s a third one up there too she&amp;#39;s not dead hey sit down they got me looking up now they got me paranoid which is good was there an alternative way to go I didn&amp;#39;t even see that yeah there&amp;#39;s an alternative way to go here I didn&amp;#39;t see it maybe I&amp;#39;m just just flying by it not paying attention ah gosh yeah it&amp;#39;s this way what the [ __ ] no don&amp;#39;t don&amp;#39;t Cur anything don&amp;#39;t you curse anything yeah it&amp;#39;s this way look at there&amp;#39;s a lot of the medkits down here I&amp;#39;m not going to [ __ ] with that side room not going to hold you I&amp;#39;m not even going to worry about it oh hey we got a six $650 bonus for traveling even though we&amp;#39;re technically not with the FBI anymore weird how that works huh no but I don&amp;#39;t want to be oh [ __ ] oh [ __ ] what is that what are these why am I being attacked by the [ __ ] what what are these things why am I being attacked by the [ __ ] environment itself now what is this that&amp;#39;s new those are freaky I don&amp;#39;t like those I mash that like four times and it would not pick up yeah the the button delay is a little off in this game or in put delay I don&amp;#39;t know why I could delay guess they technically mean the same thing but you know oh [ __ ] didn&amp;#39;t notice that guy popped up next to me I kill the pretty lady that&amp;#39;s SM H man I guess the whole thing is you don&amp;#39;t get Sharpshooter bonus if you uh if you kill them using the barrels cuz obviously you get that off of getting head shot and stuff so it&amp;#39;s kind of like a trade-off do you want the fight to be easy or do you want your points but I don&amp;#39;t see why I would not just go for the uh the easier thing there hey Daddy how&amp;#39;s it going how are you friend how is your weaken treating you lazy Saturday over here that&amp;#39;s good it&amp;#39;s better than a bad or upsetting Saturday I can feel it York there&amp;#39;s something in this room what do you say we gather up some puzzle pieces for Old Time sake why does he look holy [ __ ] he looks really weird there Avery [Music] does so it really was you Avery I finally found the 10ft tall giant Lena once said that the red Soul could enhance people&amp;#39;s unique characterist istics in your case it must have enhanced your physical characteristics personally though I don&amp;#39;t think enhance is the right word here burn them burn them this is simply a physical mutation caused by a drug [Laughter] overdose an artificial heart lung machine and this Tank&amp;#39;s filled with some sort of liquid if it isn&amp;#39;t Frozen at this temperature it must be a non-freezing liquid what was he using this for it couldn&amp;#39;t be cryonics did he replace Lisa&amp;#39;s bodily fluids with this stuff that sounds gross that&amp;#39;s absolutely insane leas Clarkson the first victim of the lucari case I never thought she&amp;#39;d remain trapped in ice for 14 whole years hey York why didn&amp;#39;t we work harder to find her I regret it from the bottom of my heart now well the Katrina thing happened so pleas so pretty I&amp;#39;ll protect you forever yep smiled

massive block of ice he made his own personal altar that no one would ever find and that liquid must be the solution that son Rouge is made from he used that to keep her body from decomposing mummified her that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s messed up oh red seeds I knew it York our battle began the moment we first visited this town back into the portal the pl trail of seeds this is forgotten all the way down here Katrina still found a way to make her Mark sorry I didn&amp;#39;t mean to skip through that it&amp;#39;s just like the button the input delay is bad a giant bathtub no this is a container for unloading crawfish he must have used this to freeze Lisa&amp;#39;s body in ice why didn&amp;#39;t I figure this out sooner remiss steadly Shadow oh they are indeed they are I&amp;#39;m

the theme song of the first game listen to me Patricia when Zach wakes up I want you to tell him something this is our final farewell thank you so much for all you&amp;#39;ve done over all those years you never forgot about me did you it&amp;#39;s been so long since we&amp;#39;ve seen each other but I know you always kept me in your heart that&amp;#39;s what kept me alive I owe it all to you Zach thank you and goodbye [Music] had to use the restroom for like an hour by the way it&amp;#39;s been pain but there been one long Cene with no place is to pause so well thank you thank you York the end hey Daddy now that&amp;#39;s a going thank you how are you thank you he who fights with monsters should see to it that he himself does not become a monster and if you gaze long into an abyss the abyss also gazes into you [Music] [Music] much blood was shed and many precious lives were lost Avery Smith was indicted on 11 charges including kidnapping Patricia Clarkson illegally disposing of lease Clarkson&amp;#39;s corpse and distributing the illegal substance known as son Rouge he&amp;#39;s currently serving a term of 381 years at a state prison in Angola Louisiana his first possible scheduled review for parole could happen in 127 years at the earliest Aaliyah Davis&amp;#39;s assistance in solving the case was officially acknowledged and she was transferred to the DC she didn&amp;#39;t do [ __ ] except give him a hard time thanks to Boston Chief Robert Abraham&amp;#39;s support she was officially allowed to join the son Rouge investigative task force later it was reported that her younger brother began to show small signs of recovery from his addiction Simon Jones was finally freed from his mission to monitor a certain ex agent and turned to the Boston Branch he was given a brand new computer and put back on data analysis but never worked another big case oh that&amp;#39;s not a happy ending instead he spends most of his time at the office I mean as long as he&amp;#39;s happy I guess and so after 14 long years the curtain on this gruesome case was finally closed lucari still suffers from the aftermath of the plan set into motion by Professor r AKA Helena hey toos how&amp;#39;s it going smart enough to restore the Clarkson&amp;#39;s Empire on her own yet she never tried to the true reason behind her tragic downfall remains shrouded in mystery I felt that a person&amp;#39;s life can be greatly affected by the tiniest of anomalies such as buttoning the wrong shirt button just like how this genius who once inspired Great Expectations went on to become infamous as one of the South&amp;#39;s most inhuman criminals and now after a very long time life is finally starting to return to lucari okay enjoy the credits I really I I was not kidding I&amp;#39;ve been haven&amp;#39;t to use a restroom for a really really long time so I will be right back [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] spee foree [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] spe [Music] all I&amp;#39;m [Music] back oh yeah nothing crazy happened right no stunning post credits scenes or anything like [Music] that I&amp;#39;m so glad that it&amp;#39;s finally over that game dragged on and on and on that game did not know when to end like everything about that game took about an hour longer than it probably should have like everything about that game that game like no memes was like my rogue order came today you what the funny so to mine I ordered more uh orange blood orange cuz I missed my blood orange that was my original favorite before they let me try out the new one sour candy so can&amp;#39;t get this do I have scissors up I sure do I sure do yeah my RO came in too he this game was a long exercise in patience and for all the wrong reasons like this this game was just really long winded like extremely long for like no [ __ ] reason sour W is that caffeine or what what line is that you can use code headache to get 20% off these bad boys by the way these two could be [Music] yours D was kind of willing to walk away and let Zach I I that ending was just like the most convoluted ending ever it was just like and then and then and then and then and then and then and then uh Forest is back and and then he takes over uh Zach and then and then he takes over uh Aaliyah and then they fight and then and then aiyah is gonna shoot Zach and then and then and then York comes back and he&amp;#39;s in the it&amp;#39;s just like it was like the most like all over the place ending I&amp;#39;ve ever seen like it&amp;#39;s just you know what&amp;#39;s funny is like I was like I was so invested in like the Aaliyah Simon and um the the Aaliyah Simon and uh Zach part of that like the the Prelude everything had taking place in the future the actual sequel part of the game that stuff was really cool I was really invested in it and then like it it kind of just fizzled out really badly like like the answer to all of that like the leadup to all that didn&amp;#39;t the payoff just wasn&amp;#39;t there like the payoff just did not exist like it was just more nonsense and not like fun nonsense but like kind of like that nonsense like why is Forest back it&amp;#39;s never explained oh hold on sorry not the [ __ ] pepperoni de Kaiser thank you for the I stole this from Professor R&amp;#39;s lab I figured you would I&amp;#39;ve read through it dozens of times but it still doesn&amp;#39;t make sense to me I mean at some point her plan started to collapse right otherwise I probably would have been killed early on but here I am alive and breathing and the stalker who harassed me for years has been arrested too not only that but now I have a brand new life waiting for me as air to the Clarkson Empire both lucar and the CL IND go play to yeah which I&amp;#39;ve heard is fantastically amazing I still can&amp;#39;t wait to play that see you&amp;#39;re doing plan yes I understand who&amp;#39;s in the coffin lease CU remember they uncovered Lee&amp;#39;s body things couldn&amp;#39;t possibly have ended up perfectly in accordance with her plan how can you be sure of that you earned a new life for yourself through the effort you put into it it definitely wasn&amp;#39;t something that Lena gave to you you made this life possible you didn&amp;#39;t do it all on your own of course you were only able to come this far thanks to everyone who supported you along the way could anyone really believe that Lena was the one who orchestrated all this there&amp;#39;s no way I&amp;#39;m positive all the people you&amp;#39;ve met thus far and all the things you&amp;#39;ve experienced created the person you are now Lena&amp;#39;s just one of those people and nothing more you really think so still York and I both fell for that message of hers maybe her plan really is still moving forward after all stop joking around I&amp;#39;m seriously concerned about this someone say a fireworks in the middle of October why what for that&amp;#39;s bizarre what am I going to do with you Zach by the way did you change your hair color back in order to signify some important decision you made yeah I guess I did after losing everything I finally found my true self so I&amp;#39;ve decided to accept everything that comes to me from this point on I think that color looks great on you really thanks Zach I&amp;#39;ll never give up I&amp;#39;m determined to overcome my cursed blood whatever it takes and you will that&amp;#39;s why York chose you to be his assistant you know he always knew you had it in you wow he really thought that highly of me suddenly I feel really motivated now this is crazy I don&amp;#39;t even know what I should get started with first now that&amp;#39;s the Patricia Clarkson I know oh I got it I want to go and get one of Alexis&amp;#39;s chocolate suay not a bad idea they are to Die For Those text it&amp;#39;s like he&amp;#39;s like York&amp;#39;s texting him somehow well so long Zach I&amp;#39;ll come visit you next summer Louisiana summers are just too hot for me to handle you&amp;#39;re always welcome here bye now yes I&amp;#39;ll head out now tell L Emily okay okay I&amp;#39;m texting from the afterlife t feels like today is going to be another wonderful day now time for some coffee yeah I think his sickness was tied coffee should always come first I think a sickness was tied I think a sickness to TI was tied to uh whatever&amp;#39;s happening in the other world why am I hearing bowling gone what are you doing that&amp;#39;s Miss Carpenters Lane you can&amp;#39;t take that y we did it ha ah oh look at the little picture of them he didn&amp;#39;t clean up his apartment though all right that game that game listen I I don&amp;#39;t want to be mean to that game cuz like it did its best especially a game that was in development hell for an extr an extremely long time you know like it feels like I don&amp;#39;t want to be harsh on it and I don&amp;#39;t want to be like it feels like it would be incredibly natural for me to just be like no it&amp;#39;s not that bad or hey it&amp;#39;s not that terrible but honestly like if I&amp;#39;m being honest like outside of like I think the things I guess we can start the plos positive some of the music&amp;#39;s really good in this game like this soundtrack that I&amp;#39;m playing right now that happens in the 2019 SC is actually really really good so the music is better it&amp;#39;s not the same for tracks and over over again you know I you know those same for tracks over and over again did ultimately kind of like paint the personality of the first game right so there&amp;#39;s something to that right but like I I I much prefer the fact that this game has actual music it&amp;#39;s actually fitting and good um so that&amp;#39;s cool um so I appreciate that and in general the 2019 scenes where it&amp;#39;s I I do like the idea of like we&amp;#39;re going back through a prequel and it kind of builds up to the sequel I thought that was a good idea um the prequel Parts we&amp;#39;ll get to cuz that&amp;#39;s kind of where I don&amp;#39;t like this game uh but the sequel parts are fantastic like I really like the buildup of like is z in on it is he not in on it is Aaliyah ever going to come around is Simon really an idiot or does he actually like have some good spots to him which he he ended up you know yeah he ended up being smarter than Al in a lot of ways um you know just being interesting is like is Zach dying is Zach going to die um like how did he fall so far so quickly you know um so because cuz like he&amp;#39;s in his 30s in the in the first game and then in um in like 10 years he&amp;#39;s like he&amp;#39;s looking like he&amp;#39;s in his like he&amp;#39;s elderly he&amp;#39;s in his 70s even though he should only be in his 40s so it&amp;#39;s like it was interesting to try and see where that was headed and unravel that mystery but um I think that&amp;#39;s kind of honestly where the positives end for me because like I don&amp;#39;t know the cult thing wasn&amp;#39;t that interesting it was kind of a like we talked about this in multiple different we talked about this in multiple different um aspects of the game was that like you know the reason the first game was so strong in terms of it&amp;#39;s writing uh is the first Deadly Premonition is because it&amp;#39;s ripping off Twin Peaks entirely like almost beat for beat um so that&amp;#39;s obviously why that&amp;#39;s doing so well right like that that came out well um but like this game kind of like meandered especially in the prequel aspect of it because it didn&amp;#39;t have a a hit television series that&amp;#39;s you know critically beloved to rip off all of its ideas from so all the stuff that they came up with on their own really really sucked like it was really like I think it&amp;#39;s criminal because it&amp;#39;s just boring like if I could summarize this game it&amp;#39;s unfortunately boring that would unfortunately be the adjective I would use I I would say this game is boring and that sucks to say that about a equal to a game I really really loved and I really really liked a lot but if I&amp;#39;m being honest it&amp;#39;s uh it&amp;#39;s unfortunately boring tree Peaks deal with red seeds too just go just go watch Twin Peaks like even if you don&amp;#39;t don&amp;#39;t go I would recommend you go watch the show cuz the show&amp;#39;s really good but if if you can&amp;#39;t you don&amp;#39;t have time to watch the show uh at least watch a summer you&amp;#39;ll be like oh that&amp;#39;s that character except this character oh that&amp;#39;s just like this oh that&amp;#39;s just like this and you just like you&amp;#39;ll you&amp;#39;ll you&amp;#39;ll see every single connection you&amp;#39;ll be like oh oh yeah also yeah I agree with that stinky like the game was like randomly trying to be very meditative and like just like really randomly trying to be like tackling World issues out of nowhere and it really didn&amp;#39;t fit in a game this like wacky and that&amp;#39;s not to be that&amp;#39;s not to say it&amp;#39;s not possible because the first game tackled not real world issues but tackled a lot of like you know I guess it would be real issues but like you know obviously the two killers of the first game like you know have like the reason they&amp;#39;re doing is because like of a hatred of women uh for one reason or another and like you know that is a real thing like VI violence against women is a real thing in real life and um the whole thing about like York being positively motivated by like you know the tragedy that happened with a woman in his life which was his mom versus like you know uh George and Forest which are neg are motivated by negative interactions so like George had a bad relationship with his mom so that&amp;#39;s why he&amp;#39;s doing the bad things he&amp;#39;s doing and forest with his divorce um like there was there was like it still fit it just has to be contextually right this game was just like sometimes it felt like the game was just really just like would just like it felt like the game would pause and theyd be like and now I word from our sponsor now sponsored today by uh the uh what&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s that what is that one thing what is that one thing um like it&amp;#39;s a Public Service public service announcement that&amp;#39;s what it is yeah time for our Public Service Announcement this is how you should treat people regarding this specific sensitive issue and it&amp;#39;s like it felt very like like it felt very immersion breaking um and I don&amp;#39;t know it&amp;#39;s just I feel feel like the game would have been better without it not that they did a tremendously terrible job it just didn&amp;#39;t feel like it fit very well and it feels very like out of nowhere like they were all saying that they were saying the right things for the most part but like they was just it was very clunky and awkward I don&amp;#39;t know and the actual gamepl don&amp;#39;t even me start on the gameplay the game this is one of the most boring games I have ever played I will say that I was bored to tears you know how much time we probably spent on that damn skateboard doing literally jackass all nothing like we were literally on that doing nothing for like like 15 20 minute [ __ ] drives on that [ __ ] skateboard doing literally [ __ ] nothing this game is a chore to play this game is obnoxious as [ __ ] to play I will I would never ever in the history of forever ever recommend this game to anybody to play catch a playthrough watch me play it watch somebody else play it yeah go for it but never ever would I ever recommend somebody to play this video game CU it is a chore it is boring the game even like tries to be a little bit self-aware about it at points it&amp;#39;ll like it&amp;#39;ll look at the camera and go wow this is a really long uh fetch Quest wow it&amp;#39;s like you&amp;#39;re supposed to laugh but you&amp;#39;ve been in this quest for like three hours bored out of your [ __ ] mind and the game&amp;#39;s supposed to be like haha isn&amp;#39;t this a funny fetch Quest it&amp;#39;s like no I&amp;#39;m suffering no this is boring as [ __ ] let me go like that doesn&amp;#39;t make it okay if you&amp;#39;re being s like just because you&amp;#39;re being self where that you&amp;#39;re putting me through suffering do not erase my suffering like this game was criminally [ __ ] boring this game was tedious as [ __ ] tedious and an exercise and patience I would never ever recommend this to another person catch a playthrough don&amp;#39;t ever buy this don&amp;#39;t ever buy this and that hurts me to say because like I want like I don&amp;#39;t know what they would do with the story at this point the but like if they made a game that was more like the first game it&amp;#39;d be great it&amp;#39;d be amazing I would love to have a deadly promition 3 but this game was just dreadfully [ __ ] boring and I would never ever replay I I thought about replaying Deadly Premonition because there&amp;#39;s a lot of like side quests that I skipped just cuz just for the sake of keeping the playthrough kind of like brief and I thought to myself like I&amp;#39;ll probably play that again one day just to do all the side quests this game I will never touch again within a 10 foot po I will never ever get close to this game ever again because like what what I would do as I would get sentimental about this game and I&amp;#39;ll listen to like this soundtrack the one that&amp;#39;s playing right now uh or I&amp;#39;ll like watch a a super cut of all the cut scenes uh having to do with like the 2019 part but like I would never ever ever capit Le ever play this game ever again and that&amp;#39;s not a good sign that I would never ever touch this game again playing this game was suffering it was it it committed the game&amp;#39;s cardinal sin because this is definitely one of those games that kind of gets into that zone of like it&amp;#39;s so bad it&amp;#39;s good just like this series Deadly Premonition but this was this this committed the cardinal sin of entertainment which was it was just boring it was not entertaining it was like watching paint dry most of the time like I was so invested in the 2019 like scenes where they&amp;#39;re like you know interrogating him and like trying to get the truth out of him and then I felt my heart sink every single time it cut back to the prequel what every single time it cut back to the prequel side of things I was like oh [ __ ] [ __ ] no oh brother and that&amp;#39;s not a feeling you should have with the main gameplay of your game so I don&amp;#39;t know that&amp;#39;s I mean that&amp;#39;s all you can really say about it I guess yeah like I said I wish I could be nicer to it I really wish I could be nicer to it because I I I don&amp;#39;t want to say that to the sequel to a game I actually very very much loved but it&amp;#39;s just criminally [ __ ] boring it is just it is a big old nothing Burger so yeah it&amp;#39;s a big old nothing Burger but at least it is over so yeah however we do uh we do uh I will play a little bit of debie delight since we beat that and we will have some fun don&amp;#39;t know how long I&amp;#39;ll go on WD like since I just played a whole beat a whole game but we&amp;#39;ll see all right like I said I don&amp;#39;t know how long I played Debs but I can definitely do some Debs jeez what&amp;#39;s a small game you put too much time into a small game Define a small game what do you consider a small game",

time well no with my girlfriend SL fiance swife yeah whatever back when I first moved into my first house um I played little nightmares it was kind of fun I had no idea what the [ __ ] to expect I don&amp;#39;t know what to expect with this one all I can say is that I may end up screaming like a little girl I may not I&amp;#39;m not 100% sure I can&amp;#39;t really say and I won&amp;#39;t scream but I probably will scream so without that further Ado I&amp;#39;m going to probably put my face together a little bit longer and I&amp;#39;m just going to see if anybody wants to come on in if

bonus features in DVDs nowadays you know the ones from the 80s have almost no bonus material even if they do it&amp;#39;s a trailer and the visual quality is pretty bad well that visual quality is a good reminder of those days so many new audio and visual appliances were coming out back then do you remember the first video deck we bought we bought it to record one of the Star Wars movies on TV and remember when that video store opened we spent was there just trying to find a good movie to rent W that whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa renting that was very poor driving M follow me around 200 hp that&amp;#39;s my friend now that sounds terrifying produced directed written and edited by John Dell was really awful but for some reason I still remember it pretty well it had so many sequels and

hold it tapping it was not working there&amp;#39;s an exit over here oh there&amp;#39;s not we&amp;#39;re going Offroad we&amp;#39;re going up road all right it&amp;#39;s fine also check the map why

we can&amp;#39;t the [ __ ] is this what the [ __ ] is this why is the road out this is ridiculous small town at least picks your [ __ ] all right is that where we need to go no that bone thing is something else entirely well that&amp;#39;s really far away so we got to go what would be the easiest way to get there oh that way small town big problems yeah we just got to go up here so left straight yeah left straight left right [ __ ] it God if the car noes were not so obnoxious it would actually be kind of weirdly cozy but because it&amp;#39;s not because car noises are terrible this is pretty obnoxious I can&amp;#39;t there&amp;#39;s so much stuff on the screen like having deep wounds in dbd can we go so slow we can&amp;#39;t we can&amp;#39;t be speeding in a small town that&amp;#39;s irresponsible turn my signal off why does our car have gas are isn&amp;#39;t it their responsibility fill up not mine not even my car how do I care in the car you&amp;#39;re driving yes always signal early kids the safest option Agent Morgan I can&amp;#39;t help noticing you prefer to work Al most of the time yes don&amp;#39;t you get lonely flying all over the country alone say felt lonely are you unfortunately relationships and I are fleeting strangers I don&amp;#39;t get on very well with women might be surprised to hear that&amp;#39;s because you&amp;#39;re young you notice things like that at my age you have to treat women carefully like a thin Crystal wine glass if you don&amp;#39;t they can cut scars on your face just like yours what the [ __ ] is this conversation interogation I see you were seasoned professional but let&amp;#39;s not talk about my scar it was caused by a problematic one the you good terribly good it&amp;#39;ll fade away and nobody will notice it any a week a week it&amp;#39;s not that light of a wound so Emily tell me is there really a need for a full-time sheriff in a small town like this I&amp;#39;m sure it is small to your city eyes but any Gathering of people leads to all kinds of problems fights runways you&amp;#39;re too fixated on violent crimes our job is to guide the people along the correct path first and foremost does that mean that&amp;#39;s what I consider to be my duty the correct path there he is thear in all his glory makes me glad that I was patriarch nothing I was just refle on a little while in the middle of a homicide investigation keep your mind on the matter at hand okay which right now is driving okay what a weird game that&amp;#39;s a pretty big hospital I guess they wanted to be ready for uh townwide food poisoning no no it&amp;#39;s another leftover from the town&amp;#39;s prosperous Slumber days to imagine now though isn&amp;#39;t it my mother always talked about how energetic this town used to be almost like a gold brush she used to say impressive but the hotter the fever the faster it cools and so now there&amp;#39;s hardly anyone left to use this place pains me to my Hometown lose so many citizens beyond your understanding I&amp;#39;m sure yes I&amp;#39;m sorry to say that it is indeed and that&amp;#39;s why this case is our problem okay Buddy isn&amp;#39;t any need for you to get too involved like his little poncho hello Sheriff Freckle Fiona okay hi there Fiona we&amp;#39;re here to see Usha do you know where he is I think Dr Johnson is in the computer room a computer room in a hospital nice to meet you Mr FBI agent the computer room is where our employees share computer very nice to meet you too I&amp;#39;m FBI special agent he&amp;#39;s got flash out every single time but how did you know I was FBI easy none of the police in this town wear cologne she&amp;#39;s so proud of herself for that besides that scar in your face is the biggest rumor in town rumors get exaggerated as they spread even in the countryside what&amp;#39;s that you&amp;#39;re reading if I may ask Liar&amp;#39;s house and it&amp;#39;s burning you haven&amp;#39;t heard of this yet it&amp;#39;s a recent besteller mystery it&amp;#39;s set in the US a small traditional North American town close to the Canadian border a peaceful traditional place however that peaceful town is Shattered by a terrible crime the murder of a local girl and that incident causes grief and sadness to everyone in town but everyone feels the sedici heinous evil still lurking alive yes much like the situation right now here in Greenville Fiona don&amp;#39;t say that sorry I shouldn&amp;#39;t have said that with Anna dead and all don&amp;#39;t worry books are written to entertain and it&amp;#39;s good you&amp;#39;re enjoying it what we&amp;#39;re faced with here is a terrible crime committed in a real world much different from that of a novel so there&amp;#39;s no need to apologize thank you agent y okay oh it&amp;#39;s creepy in here never mind my apologies morning till evening R might hinder our progress there&amp;#39;s thing like cat breeds please no I love the way he just tackles the doors it&amp;#39;s so funny just if I was missing any dialogue with people okay we couldn&amp;#39;t find him Fiona needs to check her information no I don&amp;#39;t think so does the doctor like playing games by any chance what do you mean there&amp;#39;s a message on the computer and a card key already set in place the king passes the rook and meets the bishop the Knight takes a PA along for the queen what does that all mean it&amp;#39;s a simple puzzle Zack let&amp;#39;s take him up on his challenge you can do this right who the what in the [ __ ] what what is happening what is this game what what the what the what in the [ __ ] is happening what why it&amp;#39;s perfect it&amp;#39;s so kind of game yes the doctor awaits below with the ceased another code but there&amp;#39;s nowhere to insert a password more games I&amp;#39;m going to get Thea to call Usha up here right now no need George the message appeared with the card key it&amp;#39;s telling us where to use it this is not the time to be joking around Agent Morgan Morgan Dr Usha is below with the deceased with Anna below being underground I take it simple simple simple Elementary M wat then it&amp;#39;s time to meet the mischievous architect of this little game what this this music track is uh something this is the most exciting thing that&amp;#39;s happened to this doctor all week and he&amp;#39;s just milking it for all it&amp;#39;s worth all right see you later Isaac it&amp;#39;s locked finally my game can begin oh here&amp;#39;s a stairwell I&amp;#39;m coming another one of those things angent honor compliment me Apple you&amp;#39;re here every single day and I appreciate that very much appreciate having you here every day very much Asha sorry to keep you waiting ah you made it let&amp;#39;s get started shall we this is Agent Morgan from the FBI nice to meet you I&amp;#39;m Usha Johnson the doctor in this Hospital FBI special agent Francis York Morgan please call me York everyone calls me that hey did you see my [ __ ] my ID did you know I&amp;#39;m in the FBI did are you a forens practitioner let&amp;#39;s just say I dealt with corpses before that doesn&amp;#39;t sound like something you should say to the police shattle of wits by the way did you create that yourself mhm I just wanted to see if our FBI agent could handle the task why I see well it was pretty fun oh glad you liked you we don&amp;#39;t have much time we need those autopsy results PGA OverWatch in my chat oh it&amp;#39;s been so long I was thinking about you yesterday we were playing Leon on stream and I was like oh we&amp;#39;re playing the meow meow been well it&amp;#39;s good to see you you&amp;#39;ve angered the Monarch you&amp;#39;ve angered the Monarch is a female term patriarch is the brother from the onset of rigor Morse the stiffening of the muscles the time of death is estimated to be between 20 and 2200 hours that&amp;#39;s still ear looks like it&amp;#39;s a good kind of busy at least Le it seems like it note that there are two exterior wounds pressure marks around the neck and a long cut running from chest to abdomen blood marks on her right hand tell us she was gripping something round in her right hand her skull is also fractured but that is unrelated to the cause of death it probably happened to her after love in Texas sh so I&amp;#39;m glad I&amp;#39;m glad I I Texas chance for me is like a hot or cold either I&amp;#39;m having the best time ever or like the worst there&amp;#39;s like no in between due to the mo on her neck but after further investigation I now have a different conclusion the direct cause of death was loss of blood from the wound yeah victim victim&amp;#39;s the role that like makes me more mad more often than not I agree which means at Le way more fun she was cut up while she was still alive yes a sharp knife was used it was inserted beneath the stern it&amp;#39;s like either you&amp;#39;re cheesing or you&amp;#39;re and I&amp;#39;m like I don&amp;#39;t want to cheese excessive Los from her internal orans is what actually killed her her nails are clean and with no skin cells from the attacker she also doesn&amp;#39;t appear to have been bound nor badly beaten interesting she was apparently killed without resistance the most tragic thing however was that she was unable to speak her story to anyone who could hear her cries the perpetrator cut out Anna&amp;#39;s tongue got tilting after that yeah I believe she was drugged first to pH her Consciousness when I was playing on Tuesday when I was playing victim I Lally stopped playing the game and switch back over to De by daylight cuz I was like this is just annoying the killer most likely has a deep traumatized past concerning women he probably cannot converse with them normally cutting out the tongue suggest a very lonely individual either that this is a very serious conversation for the for the jazzy music happening in the background he must get off on watching women suffer especially when they can&amp;#39;t answer back now he watched as the blood pumped from her body as she gradually grew cold a case in Seattle in 1985 was much like Usha please limit your report to your findings as a doctor criminal profiling is my job yeah when I&amp;#39;ve had full sex on victim it&amp;#39;s definitely way more fun I agree with that although sacking that game in general was just super fun on both sides Anna died fully deeply painfully aware of what was happening to her but tell me what time did it stop raining on the night Anna was killed oh great it&amp;#39;s heavy rain all of a sudden uh just before I went to bed right after the movie on TV ended orami killer around 1:00 a.m. what movie was it an American Werewolf in London oh directed by John Landis 1981 so the rain stopped accompanied by the ending song Blue Moon Blue Moon George would you mind if I examined Anna myself what more do you hope to [Music] find I&amp;#39;m sure I mentioned that I have a personal interest in cases like these yeah which is weird we start on his face and not like the actual victim judging from the oppression she was holding something in her hand but it was removed around 6 hours after death your entire wall glowing yes yes I have red lights back there well I can turn them to whatever I want there are two different lights got one on the right and one on the left yeah I can change those to whatever I please I just had them on red tonight CU I don&amp;#39;t know spooky scary game the reason you&amp;#39;re seeing them like do like a little light show right now is because they&amp;#39;re two separate remotes but like it&amp;#39;s kind of weird because uh one activates the other but it&amp;#39;s just funny yeah it&amp;#39;s pretty cool the object was circular with a relief cre like a Peace Mark yo homie it&amp;#39;s been a while friend good to see you prime sub in the bran stream clear as a crisp spring morning clear as a crisp spring morning thanks she you&amp;#39;ve been well good to see you again well those are some ugly ass feet she&amp;#39;s neatly wearing fake fingernails faces of evaporated liquid around the eyes she must have cried before she was murdered her blonde hair stunning even in death I don&amp;#39;t like that phrasing two I&amp;#39;m doing my dimad darnest there&amp;#39;s no reason we should focus our efforts oh George we can have Ober the people his age isn&amp;#39;t immediately apparent but he can&amp;#39;t be that old look like a trustworthy doctor shouldn&amp;#39;t stare at her for too long okay what else am I supposed to be looking at [Music] here oh whatever that was that was what I needed to see apparently from her lack of resistance I&amp;#39;d say that Anna&amp;#39;s injuries happened very quickly unable to speak she was then left to cry herself to death all starting to come together the perpetrator stayed with her for at least 2 hours until it stopped raining wow at the estimated time of her death it was still raining but you can still see tear marks on her cheeks that means she was killed under a roof somewhere she was then carried into the woods after it stopped red H there&amp;#39;s one other thing her tongue was removed with a very blunt knife in fact it&amp;#39;s more likely it was simply chopped off oh sh are you a passionate man well not particularly I&amp;#39;m but I am man enough should the moment call I think George how what the [ __ ] very passionate yes what the [ __ ] is this convers but I don&amp;#39;t see what that has to do with I&amp;#39;m with him what the [ __ ] does it mean George the perpetrator is just like you he&amp;#39;s passionate about women he&amp;#39;s a passionate kisser this was a kiss of death the perpetrator bit off Anna&amp;#39;s tongue [ __ ] what we&amp;#39;ll never get a dental print from a wound like this but this is still a big lead [ __ ] so weird ah most people can&amp;#39;t watch surgery shows just makes me queasy I&amp;#39;m just like I just think about how like I&amp;#39;m an empathetic person in general so I just feel like our old all Aman sight like how that would feel like if it happened to me you know now under the jurisdiction of the FBI I&amp;#39;m assuming command I&amp;#39;ll need you to assist me in the investigation what in the hell do you mean Agent Morgan I know I said I was passionate I like I like you can&amp;#39;t think I did this that&amp;#39;s not why I like har more than this guy you&amp;#39;re a suspect just as much as every other passionate man on Earth let me show you something [Music] or so Emily that would make more sense there you go amazing huh I&amp;#39;m sure you have a lot of questions but most of the details are top secret George Emily we should be going no need to stay here any longer okay I have to sign the release just give me a moment very well I&amp;#39;ll go on ahead I can&amp;#39;t take it any longer down here Bishop takes Queen his Rook takes your queen then your knight takes rook and checkm huh I would it&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s a trop I like a lot in any kind of me is when silly characters or that like seem like yeah like silly characters show like why they&amp;#39;re trusted my first victory in the grandm ranking you know what I&amp;#39;m saying is he just going to leave those bags there hope hopefully not what the [ __ ] is happening in here I was wondering we&amp;#39;re going get back to this stuff with like the weird zombie monsters and [ __ ] cuz it hasn&amp;#39;t been addressed in a bit Zach they&amp;#39;re here can nobody else see this oh we can sneeze oh the hold breath thing say down or something okay why does it sound so close is it the body okay there&amp;#39;s a 10 mm that&amp;#39;s not for our gun our gun&amp;#39;s a 9 mm this really A Silent Hill huh is he the only one that sees this I would explain why like it&amp;#39;s not really brought up after the first thing counter he&amp;#39;s the one who&amp;#39;s seeing it oh [ __ ] I totally missed that head shot but the game said it sure have loaded handgun ammo yeah it&amp;#39;s kind of interesting just want to die stay over there oh [ __ ] I don&amp;#39;t like when they do that I don&amp;#39;t like when they [ __ ] teleport oh I do have to go this way I was probably be safer to hang out over there and get them before they come around the corner but not I don&amp;#39;t like that oh [ __ ] she she almost got to me oh my that holy [ __ ] okay okay we got to go in there but I want to yeah I want to clear out this area oh gosh there&amp;#39;s a lot yeah so I don&amp;#39;t get snuck up on while I&amp;#39;m going in here what oh look coffee interesting oh [ __ ] yeah it&amp;#39;s just the doctor it&amp;#39;s just the doctor tricking tricking trick tricking us I feel like it might be a good idea to good idea to break these actors are really good yeah we&amp;#39;re totally just we&amp;#39;re murdering them we can move those that&amp;#39;s cool going through going through so I would have had to go do that stuff anyways get through this door I did that in the right order why do I have like a little like hangout spot in the [ __ ] weirdo world could you shoot Dr yeah in the [ __ ] I [ __ ] up your I saw I noticed it was like Hey this will take whoever knows how long to [ __ ] get better they clean the thing I&amp;#39;m going save after I picked up all that stuff so I don&amp;#39;t have to go through that again if something bad happens not quite where I&amp;#39;m supposed to be going after this point get

sorry for the flash did not know that was coming Agent Morgan if you&amp;#39;re so desperate then why not smoke two at once so he&amp;#39;s the only one that can see that nobody else can what the [ __ ] is that who&amp;#39;s that old man that&amp;#39;s Harry Harry Stewart one of the bigger problems around here his father started up the lumber trade and founded this town but he&amp;#39;s a weird one as I&amp;#39;m sure you can see always dressed like that never speaking to the town&amp;#39;s folk and just FYI he owns almost the entire [Music] town not that that makes any difference so

nonsense don&amp;#39;t give it any thought it&amp;#39;s all gibberish Emily here uh-huh oh okay thank you Thomas agent York we&amp;#39;ve contacted the first witnesses to the crime scene you can interview them where they found the dead body excellent I was just about to ask I smack mic there before somebody&amp;#39;s like I heard Morse code course somebody says something speaking of Nord n what kind of Morse code do you listen to that sounds like like bunking the mic that was the weirdest thing that I have ever experienced bro listen to Morse code like how does this sound like Morse code just like dunk in the mic how does that sound like Morse code to you at your ears checked on me the body was found in the green ve Forest Park that&amp;#39;s West from here and too far to walk a forest park it&amp;#39;s the pride of the Town it has a beautiful Trail leading to a you for the insults you ask for the insult brother F you pay for it uh that may have to wait we promise to be there by 1800 oh we promise Pinky Promise scene Agent Morgan if I could just give you a friendly warning are you really upset about me taking over the case I have the authority approved by the FBI to assume command I understand you don&amp;#39;t like it but you will follow my orders I&amp;#39;m not disputing FBI Authority but this is our town you won&amp;#39;t get far alone and you gain Nothing by antagonizing me part of extra Diner scenes what do you mean I just do things my way Diner take you off the case if you wish stop it you two we need to solve this case not bicker among [Music] ourselves why do he smile like that at the end oh oh so oh [ __ ] I did the thing again so it&amp;#39;s like I don&amp;#39;t have to rush straight to like the game is essentially give me a lot M of time if you&amp;#39;re wandering off agent York [ __ ] so like it&amp;#39;s giving me a lot more time to go like hang out is essentially what it is so I should go mess around and [ __ ] around [Music] previously during the investigation these puppies are making me go to another town in The Boondocks again I didn&amp;#39;t think you&amp;#39;d keep me waiting in the rain for so long welcome to Green I&amp;#39;m the sheriff George Woodman call me George there&amp;#39;s definitely something in this town do you feel it Zach my coffee warned me about it the body was found in the green Veil Forest it&amp;#39;s funny cuz we&amp;#39;re eventually we should probably ditch them anyway or else they want to come with us to the diner um either way I&amp;#39;m going to umuse take this moment to use the restroom real quick we have been playing for like two and a half hours this like when you were describing this to me brand 2 is like it&amp;#39;s really wacky like it is really wacky but it&amp;#39;s also like it&amp;#39;s actually got a lot of substance to it like the when you sent me that like meme uh that Meme picture or the the two pictures where you&amp;#39;re like these are both these are both uh these are both like real uh real uh reviews of the game when it came out one was the zero and one was like really good like I don&amp;#39;t I don&amp;#39;t get the zero like it&amp;#39;s like yeah it&amp;#39;s a goofy game but like as long as you know that like you&amp;#39;re like it it&amp;#39;s genuinely funny and weird in a good way like I don&amp;#39;t know I don&amp;#39;t I don&amp;#39;t I don&amp;#39;t get how somebody could hate this like like it may not be for you I think that would be my uh that would be my uh two cents it&amp;#39;s like it may not be for you may not be your brand of weird that you may enjoy in games or shows but it is like it is good you know it is the weird doesn&amp;#39;t make it bad but yeah I&amp;#39;m going to go use restroom get more water cuz I am out of water I&amp;#39;ll be back yeah some the the permition is deadly and it&amp;#39;s really cool so yeah I&amp;#39;ll be right back enjoy your chair time sh for for for back staying hydrated is important staying hydrated is super important so if you did not hydrate your you&amp;#39;re not hydrating yourself you definitely should definitely should you&amp;#39;re did things I like how you did you&amp;#39;re not like like you&amp;#39;re like usually chair 4ks or something or something app to the game but this game&amp;#39;s so weird like I don&amp;#39;t know the chair just did things I guess chair just did something I don&amp;#39;t know I don&amp;#39;t know chair did something or another oh the birds come like Qui away here it&amp;#39;s interesting I just realized this background kind of looks like one of the backgrounds you can have is a Norman in uh with his little do hickey and heavy rain or if that&amp;#39;s on purpose okay Agent Morgan yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah wait why is that beeping oh there&amp;#39;s a cart or something right out there they&amp;#39;re probably going to leave me behind but that honestly that&amp;#39;s fine if I have time to [ __ ] around I definitely should if you&amp;#39;re wandering off agent York I know I know I&amp;#39;m being a big [ __ ] by not rushing immediately there but there&amp;#39;s stuff to do want to have a training cart or something over here why is this game give me like weird yuza Vibes the accua games say there&amp;#39;s a training cart here but I don&amp;#39;t see it there&amp;#39;s a basketball court I&amp;#39;m almost on top of it and I don&amp;#39;t see it anywhere yeah it says it&amp;#39;s right here but I don&amp;#39;t see it anywhere on the [ __ ] roof okay whatever I don&amp;#39;t care about it that much well I can drive this car instead we&amp;#39;re rooming I think they could have taken the opacity a little deeper so I could uh see a little bit better can&amp;#39;t thought the music&amp;#39;s quiet speaking of movies or like the car deadly do you remember that one Z back in3 directed by Douglas MC right it was filmed pretty cheap but still was pretty good the monster design with the mouth cram full of teeth I loved it so many delicious Bey cliches you me a sequel I never got to see the sequel the rental store didn&amp;#39;t have it for some reason they said the they some of the mechanics of the director&amp;#39;s cut that&amp;#39;s kind of scary wonder how the sequel turned out you know the monster in that one responded to sound wait sounds a lot like the movie Tremors Tremors think that one was back in 89 directed by Ron Underwood now that was a great role for Kevin Bacon Masterpiece Z that one had sequence like crazy there was a fourth one I&amp;#39;ve only seen the first one though also same also same where that bone thing is over there let&amp;#39;s go and see what that is go to the diner I mean I guess I can I&amp;#39;ll go see what that bone stuff was real quick but if I have to go to the diner I will is there some bone weird bone thing on the map although there&amp;#39;s no here maybe yeah there we go okay yeah I didn&amp;#39;t know this is an open World game as well I was not aware Zach is there something here that you want to check out well just do as you please we can head to the forest later I have a weapon equ I do not when speaks since part game it is Jo I&amp;#39;ve never played it or seen it so it&amp;#39;s uh very interesting so far actually not bad it&amp;#39;s actually not bad bad which is very funny is good it is it is is very good I still need to finish that I know Laura Duran&amp;#39;s in the movie apparently she&amp;#39;s good at most things she&amp;#39;s in besides the Last Jedi but we forget that movie exists for our own uh joy and happiness yeah there&amp;#39;s a lot of Agents honor up here whatever the [ __ ] that is there&amp;#39;s a pepperoni hello hello oh well you can&amp;#39;t pet the dogs you&amp;#39;re out of 10 game what the [ __ ] a human bone this doesn&amp;#39;t look related to the case but shouldn&amp;#39;t I let someone know yes absolutely the paperoni just vibing over here [Music] interesting oh fun fact you you two are collectively my favorite people like uh Joey when I&amp;#39;m talking about like my like my best online friend that&amp;#39;s brand 2 and brand 2 when I

police station or I guess that was there&amp;#39;s not like a journal or like a quest log is there bunch of Bones around the map oh so you have to like complete their skeleton or something wish I could turn off the music like I want the music in instances where like music would be cool but not just while I&amp;#39;m driving I think Fred Ward was in it you say Fred Ward and I say Remo Williams the adventure begins that one was back in &amp;#39; 85 I think directed by Guy Hamilton guess Hamilton was aiming to start a series like7 but it had no sequels shame do you remember the martial arts they used in that film called Sanu the timate in martial arts using no weapons at all Remo&amp;#39;s Master Chun ran across water and he loved so man that was a good character it was played by Joel gray the best supporting actor in Cabaret of course in Remo he had so much makeup on he couldn&amp;#39;t tell driving section then why did they record so much for this that&amp;#39;s so interesting I&amp;#39;m assuming the diner is in town right skateboarding could do tricks what the what what why that&amp;#39;s so weird the best Beed J that&amp;#39;s funny oh I see the diner I see it yeah yeah

know the driving in this game already I&amp;#39;m like that&amp;#39;s not happening you are not going to make me do that the races aren&amp;#39;t optional I would I would cry can I mark this somehow I Mission side mission is yet to occur oh it&amp;#39;s good to see you H hope you&amp;#39;re doing well this sat teror day night so you can&amp;#39;t Mark objectives that&amp;#39;s a problem that&amp;#39;s a huge problem actually yeah I don&amp;#39;t like that I like that you can&amp;#39;t Mark like Mark the map that&amp;#39;s kind of icky I can see why you didn&amp;#39;t do the bone side Quest cuz like trying to navigate this map without the ability to Mark things sounds like a nightmare all right I&amp;#39;m just I&amp;#39;m just going to go to the thing like you said if there&amp;#39;s a if there&amp;#39;s a there&amp;#39;s a main quest where I get to meet the town and then a lot more stuff opens up it may be smarter to just do that stuff after the fact after that happens that way I&amp;#39;m not just kind of wandering around aimlessly and I feel like I have a purpose now Joel Gray&amp;#39;s daughter is of course that&amp;#39;s where Jennifer Gray you knew that right Zach Jennifer Gray whoa she&amp;#39;s in one of my most favorite movies Ferris bu&amp;#39;s day off oh brother 1986 directed by John Hughes suspect suspect you&amp;#39;re not the most cheerful guy I know you really do like those cheerful movies why are they suspects teenage movies back then overett why are they suspects now that was an impressive film you got sha pen the Jif not to mention nichas cage the suspect oh I see BT byow I was like why are they suspects might be a great film do you remember Z when that movie ended the last words the end was from an arcade game that&amp;#39;s right it was from a Missile Command it&amp;#39;s stuck in my head for a while the memories I feel like I have a lot of movies to catch up on let&amp;#39;s just hope we can get to the end of this case soon then maybe we can catch up on a few give some thought about what movie you want to see next conversation yeah it&amp;#39;s a lot a lot of [ __ ] info oh these are train tracks that&amp;#39;s not a road oops you didn&amp;#39;t see anything how do I get over there does this actually leave me where I need to go it does okay we&amp;#39;re good we&amp;#39;re good we&amp;#39;re good right now I&amp;#39;m confused that&amp;#39;s our main character you know just talking to himself how&amp;#39;s he do how&amp;#39;s he do yeah I totally have important business byebye we&amp;#39;re going to get to go over a cute little Bridge I totally have important business get out of the way Sirens go through traffic sh party pooper that&amp;#39;s why they didn&amp;#39;t invite you party pooper party pooper why is there [ __ ] in the road the [ __ ] is wrong with this place uh I think this tunnel is not safe okay Z I&amp;#39;ve been thinking about what movie I&amp;#39;d like to watch next and finally I&amp;#39;ve made always made a decision guys it&amp;#39;s always hard to narrow it down just to one movie but I&amp;#39;ve put a lot of thought into this and I&amp;#39;m sure you&amp;#39;ll agree with me 1975 directed by Steven Spielberg himself the grandfather of panic movies Panic movies small town in Massachusetts that movie made me stay away from the beach for years I was always afraid that a hand might come floating up you know what I&amp;#39;m talking about right it&amp;#39;s Jaws the underwater camera work accompanied by that Willams music been that scared by a movie before but the best thing about it dude I was when I first saw jws I was taking I was actively taking swim lessons that was the worst combo ever in my entire life above film gave a lot of time to the dispute and friction between them certainly had a lot of messages for a two-hour film that&amp;#39;s probably another reason why it was such a record-breaking hit one of my regrets in life is that I didn&amp;#39;t see it at the movie theater I guess I was still just a child back then but still my hand back in real time boo that reminds me did you know this one Jaws also appears in another movie that was produced by Spielberg the second Back to the Future it was directed by Robert zakus who later made Forest G that&amp;#39;s also a masterpiece of course but we&amp;#39;ll discuss that another time this L feels like I&amp;#39;m in like yeah I feel like I&amp;#39;m in a film Theory class McDonald okay you want and is Attack by a holog is shocked of but looking closer he sees the Jaws part 19 the director is credited as Steven Spielberg Jr in reality there were actually only four Jaws movies it was still a great joke M chimpin got you yo my thank you so much for the follow I appreciate that hopefully you&amp;#39;re doing well though I wonder what life would be like by then Z okay I&amp;#39;ll get some I&amp;#39;ll pick up some shimkin nuggets for you guys I&amp;#39;m going to get myself a sandwich trip with brand lit hey what do what do you guys want to talk about hey let&amp;#39;s not talk about movies usually when I go to McDonald&amp;#39;s I get a double Corner pounder but sometimes I just get a couple cheeseburgers and a small fry after working there for four years I&amp;#39;m not as much a fan of like the uh chicken nuggets and stuff cuz they get pretty gross in that uh eating vent gu runs out fast this car it does to to is raing me raing me reading me raing me raing me yo tus thank you so much for the raid friend how was your stream how than go Bud hopefully your stream went well if you guys don&amp;#39;t follow Tois I hate you there is no hians or butts I hate you so follow them or you&amp;#39;re the worse was okay hey we take those that&amp;#39;s not bad that&amp;#39;s not bad and we take those wow amori what is amori you hate me know I hate I hate that I hate people if they don&amp;#39;t follow you obviously you follow yourself so you tell us to come here and you keep us waiting is this the way the FBI treats their own people hello George I just had some wait they yell if you don&amp;#39;t go immediately you really are pushing it you know wait they get mad but it was important stuff to me at least miss the snacks I miss the snacks to midd of a want to go Toy&amp;#39;s with their snack not listening George I think we both know by now how little he thinks of other people&amp;#39;s feelings I&amp;#39;ll be more careful from now on I promise what the [ __ ] wait did I do a bad wait FBI why are they mad at me yorgan please call me York it&amp;#39;s what everyone calls me and you are Jim green that I am son I keep these Woods why were they mad at me well you&amp;#39;re doing a fine job well I used to be a tree surgeon Mor&amp;#39;s life Mor&amp;#39;s love More&amp;#39;s life and these two discovered the B yes my grandchildren Isaac and Isaiah oh the twins oh oh twins we&amp;#39;ve been saying that&amp;#39;s why their hair changed twins exactly you see that twins just like in my dream all right see apple we got to keep an eye on these two friend I&amp;#39;m sorry could we talk away from the boys I want to help your investigation but I don&amp;#39;t want them to hear this very well Emily please well I I I never even got into like Earthbound or anything thank you so I don&amp;#39;t know if I&amp;#39;m worri would be don&amp;#39;t do anything without asking me these children were the first to witness the crime scene I want to talk to them come on they&amp;#39;re just kids they have no idea what really happen he likes bracing doesn&amp;#39;t matter you agree with me right Zach how heartless do you ever think of other people&amp;#39;s feelings ever Emily&amp;#39;s right why are they being mean to me c even for the sake of Investigation children see things in pure simple terms they may have seen something we adults would never spot and they are here at our request as well we could at least chat with them and see if they want to make a statement are you serious I never joke about matters like this oh my I never joke about matters like this don&amp;#39;t worry why do that as you think look at them standing so upright there now then Isaac Isaiah tell me what did you find here anna she was so pretty had a red dress on her hair was shining bright gold hair there were lots of animals around her squirrel weasel and a snake a real snake put a fake snake on and them we know now Anna was the Fairy of the forest she was a goddess she smiled when she saw us she looked so happy that&amp;#39;s right Isaac Isaiah she was a fairy a goddess I&amp;#39;m sure she is playing with those animals even now of course she is yeah of course most useful information boys well Emily you can take them now [ __ ] did we learn from that if anything oh okay Zach this is where Anna&amp;#39;s body was the sky again our Unknown Subject Was Here too so what happened here still don&amp;#39;t get to profile anything too much oh what the [ __ ] crap it the bit right yeah hold up Zach something is still missing we need more clues wait why am I wearing my Poncho oh did it just start reading as you requested we have permission to stay and look around as needed but what are you planning on doing to examine the scene of course basic crime investigation 101 we might uncover some further Evidence my men have covered this already I seriously doubt that there is anything else to find well then you and Emily can wait in the car if that&amp;#39;s the case but Rude why can we sleep in this Hut this is unnerving how&amp;#39;s this game going from like a goofball game to like this stuff didn&amp;#39;t I just play this part for [Music] I shoot those oh you do ah okay what are Emily that think I&amp;#39;m just over here just shooting venil part oh boy can of pickles that was worth it totally worth it oh oh gosh that did not look good oh this didn&amp;#39;t lead to anything so I just vandalized all that for nothing there was nothing even up here guess we shoot this too don&amp;#39;t just climb up and grab it you just got to eat it out of there where&amp;#39;s the final oh it&amp;#39;s over here kill her big foot maybe oh I see cuz it falls up there so you need to destroy the fences to get up there once that falls out of the tree gotcha okay [Music] I haven&amp;#39;t seen one of these in a long time it&amp;#39;s upside down I guess this is meant to be an anti-p sentiment then these holes on the ground were made by uh High stiletto heels all around here and this depression here Agent Morgan I see what happened here he hung her from the tree and put on her shoes enjoying it sicko not appropriate song for this knelt down and disgusting George you certainly have a vivid imagination an interesting Theory don&amp;#39;t you think Zach what was his name again that Hollywood producer that&amp;#39;s right Joel we really ought to introduce George to him Zach what the [ __ ] profiling is a little different from writing a screenplay though an idea being interesting doesn&amp;#39;t make it fact let me Enlighten you George the footprints reveal that one of the heels were missing from the shoes and they&amp;#39;re different from Anna&amp;#39;s shoes that we saw at the office furthermore there would be even more disgusting evidence if he did kneel and well do as you suggested if you want proof go ahead and try for yourself he knowed here for a reason other than simple perversion Zack what was he doing in front of Anna weach maybe maybe maybe we are he&amp;#39;s talking to us now I get it he was kneeling to pray in front of her just like the twin said she was a goddess the UN our Unknown Subject offered prayers to her it&amp;#39;s bitten out tongue massive body Once Dead Anna was transformed from an object of despite into one of worship so who is Miss stiletto heels the steps are close coming up to the body and then farther apart going away there was a reason to hurry away then that settles it then George Miss stiletto heels is a third party here she&amp;#39;s not the murderer no one runs away from an object of worship she could be another victim who was with Anna or perhaps an accomplice who fled for some reason getting more complicated by the she is also one who took whatever it was Anna was holding on to in her hand but why me my B why did she leave her here only miss stiletto heels knows the reason for that she might know something about the man with the Reversed peace Mar too how many women wear high stiletto heels in this town do you think oh I should think most of them have at least one pair I do too this this this game really only does have three soundtracks nobody would come all the way out here wearing them except well except maybe one person don&amp;#39;t keep me in the dark then who might this elegant lady be gu the owner of the art gallery there&amp;#39;s an art gallery but she&amp;#39;s out of town for a big Art Auction I heard she&amp;#39;ll be coming back in a couple days then we&amp;#39;ll just have to give her a warm welcome home a more immediate matter then where in town can you find something like this it should be a building that isn&amp;#39;t used anymore with either a lot of metal or metal machinery you mean like a lumber mill the old lber M then it&amp;#39;s time to really get this show on the road could you guide me to this perfect setting for extravagant murder there just touching evidence I don&amp;#39;t know couldn&amp;#39;t tell you what&amp;#39;s wrong with my tie from here if that&amp;#39;s where she was killed why would the killer go to all the trouble of carrying her all the way here I don&amp;#39;t know yet my profile this tell me one thing is for sure though the unsub&amp;#39;s personality is totally different before and after the crime the unsub killed her in a brutal horrifying way well that&amp;#39;s not normal and then displays powerful adoration after she&amp;#39;s dead something close to love that could well be the key to all this I will say this though George profiling is a risky business of course if the unsub planted those stal Footprints himself well then everything I&amp;#39;ve just said falls apart but there&amp;#39;s no evidence that he left those stiletto oh my go I&amp;#39;m sure we have Miss stiletto heels to thank for those tracks all I can do is deduce the unsub feelings in light of the evidence and carefully figure the unsub Mo modus operandi his way of thinking it usually unveils something that a normal forensic analysis May Overlook that&amp;#39;s my way of back not for everyone but it works for me what the tie is that good good point good point to be honest we have no gas no durability and no uh time limit that&amp;#39;s interesting we going we go all the way that&amp;#39;s actually not too far away when I first joined the L was still in swing right when I first moved here and now it&amp;#39;s totally abandoned I presume so I&amp;#39;ve never really been inside so I don&amp;#39;t know for sure but sure is run down deserted buildings are perfect for criminal hideouts and activities I keep telling Harry to have a place probably after all it&amp;#39;s already used as the of&amp;#39;s murder don&amp;#39;t want to bring it up he does do the little earpiece motion a lot so that&amp;#39;s probably what they assume is happening doesn&amp;#39;t always do it very confident about this confident know confidence is a sweet SP being rude and Hess I&amp;#39;m just drawing natural conclusions from the facts that we&amp;#39;ve seen that sounds exactly like being full of confidence least to me and normal people with common sense Common Sense can be the opposite of fact sometimes that oh I willor thank you for ofs either way&amp;#39;ll for simp going to so if you get pearls and them to yourself let&amp;#39;s hurry well said George there&amp;#39;s so mean to him they&amp;#39;re so mean to him why are they so

don&amp;#39;t know why that works at an abandoned Mill but we&amp;#39;ll talk about that later I suppose I don&amp;#39;t know how to feel about this groovy techno that what&amp;#39;s happening in the background new game mode I have no idea what the new game mode for dead by daylight will be no clue no clue what they could do honestly I like de by and it&amp;#39;s one game mode it has so I&amp;#39;m not particularly interested in more game modes I like most people that want more game modes than by daylight aren&amp;#39;t going to play them so I don&amp;#39;t know why they&amp;#39;re particularly asking for it to be honest I&amp;#39;m going in alone you two stay here why I can&amp;#39;t concentrate on profiling with other people around me now hold on a minute we&amp;#39;re investigating this case together okay now they&amp;#39;re I can&amp;#39;t risk the crime scene being compromised by you two what are you saying you&amp;#39;re not the only professional law enforc officer here Agent Morgan we know how to secure a crime scene I&amp;#39;m sorry that was rude of me but this is how I operate furthermore yes furthermore what to me the outsider FBI agent every citizen of this town as a suspect you two could be in on this whole thing for all I know I have to keep suspects out of the crime scene how can you say such a thing he&amp;#39;s not entirely wrong but like keeping them out is also weird making fun of us we should have left him behind and come here by ourselves you&amp;#39;re right I&amp;#39;ve never been so insulted sorry but I&amp;#39;m just doing my job a submachine gun why do we need that did you hear that Zack if they are Pros then we should let every firstperson shooter gamer out there join the SWAT team that was a very interesting L Zach

just like show up around corners there&amp;#39;s never been anything in those boxes I had to shoot through that to hit him okay R side don&amp;#39;t put that on my head oh he&amp;#39;s going backwards interesting I don&amp;#39;t want to die [Music] just a solid fog texture just right there that&amp;#39;s fine what the [ __ ] is that looks scarier than usual is that the hooded guy we met at the beginning just as I thought Zack this is where Anna was killed weird he&amp;#39;s got to this that habit man long it&amp;#39;s going to start looking like charcoal hey come here oh how could this game be simultaneously so silly but so disturbing at the same time like it legitly makes me uncomfortable too much noise we&amp;#39;re still missing a vital piece of the puzzle a submachine gun oh you know just as you do you just find a submachine gun chilling down here okay all righty that&amp;#39;s just normal I guess what oh I&amp;#39;m glad we are in here so we could change sh real quick wait I can&amp;#39;t switch this is [ __ ] why you even have it here this is redonkulous what lollipop what do you want [Music] where are you hiding oh yeah oh that sound effect oh man he okay so like we have to get all the evidence for that to all make sense inrow I see I see I see okay okay why even give me the option if I can&amp;#39;t do it okay that&amp;#39;s just just weird now can I now

sleep supposed to dark sleep oh now I need food just take a nappy we&amp;#39;re going to need some food yeah better each day that&amp;#39;s good that&amp;#39;s good to hear I know that must be incredibly difficult more so than I could ever imagine so I&amp;#39;m glad you&amp;#39;re doing the best you can I still can&amp;#39;t [ __ ] switch this is ridiculous I&amp;#39;m getting mad well

St or not oh interesting don&amp;#39;t do that die faster you get out of my way yeah you got to be considerate is it bad I don&amp;#39;t hate this combat to be honest it Lally just does feel like Walmart res Evil 4 but I have all games to emulate not a bad choice oh boy a pipe I&amp;#39;m actually not going to take that pipe who gives a [ __ ] oh there&amp;#39;s another one what&amp;#39;s all the steel pipes uh this is where I got to go yeah just [ __ ] it what that mean oh that&amp;#39;s where we need one of these that&amp;#39;s why there steel pipes everywhere cuz we need one I see I see I see I see oh oh oh my no damage run was almost compromised my totally intentional head shot I can&amp;#39;t take that [Music] seriously that noise is so unserious please yes oh that&amp;#39;s is creepy you got spooky yeah we&amp;#39;re in the not Silent Hill world that only our agent Can See For some [Music] reason hey they they&amp;#39;re keeping dbd players down here here [Music] listen that&amp;#39;s so satisfying to take out all the barrels that way oh I&amp;#39;m I&amp;#39;m running out of ammo for this Golf Club this really Silent [Music] Hill play the baby but it&amp;#39;s a DVD player it&amp;#39;s going to cry about everything it&amp;#39;s never going to [Music] stop how good things get it&amp;#39;s going to cry anyway why is it in the toilet yes I too have played silal Hill 2 one the greatest horror games of all time think I think I&amp;#39;m going to take out the other one again just just just a thought consider the following let&amp;#39;s just uh let&amp;#39;s take the the big gun back out you&amp;#39;re not the big guy pipes around your inventory I can&amp;#39;t say I do not oh I can&amp;#39;t say I do not precisely on the menu nor get an insult I would but you probably just apologize to me again I don&amp;#39;t want to deal with that noise so no probably send me a formal four page written essay about how apologetic you are for whatever I insulted you about this shirt&amp;#39;s probably really dirty at this point I probably should change it but it didn&amp;#39;t let me back there so unfortunate no my no damage run no myo damage run I I have to restart guys I have to restart this is so sad we we we&amp;#39;ve been going for [ __ ] three and a half hours without any damage taken this is half yeah we just got to restart start the game yeah it was a good run [Music] another DVD player y keep be a lot of them down [Music] here oh there&amp;#39;s a lot of those things in here [Music] he that the Box actually dropped something this is where dbd GES to [Music] die you&amp;#39;re not weird but it kind of feels nice to play something on controller again I know in most cases mouse and keyboard is better for like anything and everything it feels nice to just sit here and at the like gamer lean you know just kick back with my controller that know probably could use that in oh [ __ ] oh [ __ ] oh [ __ ] I don&amp;#39;t want to die oh what did that yeah maybe you shouldn&amp;#39;t have attacked me then some H oh je stop he he has gaining on me he is gaining on me well so far we&amp;#39;re trying to discover a murder or discover who murdered this this girl in this small town but for some reason we&amp;#39;re it&amp;#39;s being interlaced with this like Silent Hill like area that only our detective can see which is not been explained yet but it&amp;#39;s pretty interesting so we&amp;#39;re trying to solve this murder but we&amp;#39;re also like going to this weird hell Zone then only our detective seems to see it he doesn&amp;#39;t bring it up to anybody else either a normal investigator I I I mean he gets like Prem itions and stuff that&amp;#39;s the name permition this Silent Hill this weird like Silent Hill stuff is interesting I don&amp;#39;t know if he&amp;#39;s always experienced this or if this is like specific to this case or what I that&amp;#39;s really been explained yet oh [ __ ] I was like which one is it coming out of I want to oh Shee they&amp;#39;re so quiet sometimes like oh oh oh don&amp;#39;t do that don&amp;#39;t do that yeah don&amp;#39;t do that the crab walk you [ __ ] I don&amp;#39;t like that I&amp;#39;ve been aiming for Center MK cuz for the head sometimes it just kind of like flies over him wow black coffee I see what people like this game oh [ __ ] oh [ __ ] one right here oh [ __ ] oh [ __ ] oh [ __ ] oh [ __ ] oh [ __ ] keep going keep going okay it&amp;#39;s fine everything isine fine you she we fine hey mister how are you dude how night treating you yeah this is definitely s looking over here oh I have to oh it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s such an interesting mix of like like campy corniness and like legitimately like legitimate like unnerving content it&amp;#39;s very interesting great just got home cool good hopefully you can relax and chill what wait oh was the fire still going was that what that was Oh I thought because it wasn&amp;#39;t on my screen anymore it was gone but I guess it effect had run out yet it&amp;#39;s just a little bit of damage it&amp;#39;s not that much I don&amp;#39;t need to immediately heal up but I&amp;#39;m wondering if like they like does he have to actively like does he have to like I don&amp;#39;t know like like is that is this whole like Silent Hill area thing like the reason he does it all his stuff alone cuz that would make sense why he&amp;#39;s so like adamant about doing everything alone I was too close to that oops if like you know they had to be subjected to that somehow if they came with him they&amp;#39;d have to see this stuff or be put in danger by it as well that would make sense but still interesting oh there was stuff in that corner I didn&amp;#39;t see that&amp;#39;s bizarre ah it&amp;#39;s so bizarre I don&amp;#39;t know see what is this saying that&amp;#39;s power all right but the motor doesn&amp;#39;t seem to be working is there Machinery behind the elevator like this stuff like there&amp;#39;s nothing interactable back here oh okay had to turn right there we [Music] go give me a guessing oh okay I mean I did I did guess the killer in uh heavy rain so I&amp;#39;m one for one so far I should just become a real life detective that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s what I that&amp;#39;s what I&amp;#39;m learning from this experience totally if I&amp;#39;m two for two I got to quit streaming oh somebody&amp;#39;s afraid of heights that elevator messing up scares me oh oh oh this is not good I don&amp;#39;t [ __ ] like that dude what is he doing he&amp;#39;s kind of buff kind of kind of ripping through that shirt there a little bit I was kind to do that the other day I put on my old flannel like my black and gray one it&amp;#39;s was like like I&amp;#39;m like stretching that thing now I don&amp;#39;t like those noises hey come here no no yes ma your purse almost for hour in the Stream yeah it&amp;#39;s so like I like what you said earlier is like what kind of game do you make and they said [Music] yes is that it well interesting like all the things that throws together I think that&amp;#39;s where I&amp;#39;m at like I&amp;#39;m like I just I&amp;#39;m into all the different things that it&amp;#39;s doing you know are make looking different yeah it&amp;#39;s uh res remake uh res 4 we just have it at home the Great Value brand on Med yeah I think it&amp;#39;s cool that a lot of other people feel that way too I actually did not expect this to win the uh win the uh I did not expect this to win the poll for uh the let&amp;#39;s play for Saturday request but I&amp;#39;m happy it did I can see why the game has like a a following cuz I didn&amp;#39;t know it had one did not know this one&amp;#39;s been a suggested game for a while too it&amp;#39;s just like you warned me very early on that the game like did not function on Steam so we just like I just didn&amp;#39;t put on the poll cuz I was like don&amp;#39;t know about that chief course sh money on the line you know what&amp;#39;s funny uh Tay toah she&amp;#39;s been wanting to have uh Amia the bunker win for like I don&amp;#39;t even like ever since we&amp;#39;ve started putting Amia the bunker on she&amp;#39;s been wanting that game really really badly so she it lost again so she&amp;#39;s going to be upset my bad no it&amp;#39;s fine it&amp;#39;s just funny it&amp;#39;s just funny cuz she&amp;#39;s what been want that for a long time game and so hey Sharky Cy boy how you this fine we friend been up dude you and Ace you and Ace both have really really wanted me to play uh the faith uh the faith games and that&amp;#39;s been losing a lot too well we got a good group of games though you know like we will we will eventually get through them though oh chillax this combat is incredibly simple but I&amp;#39;m not going to lie I kind of enjoy it honestly I would play Faith just solely on in the the the regards of like the cool like weird like textas speech that they use I am going to save you you cannot save me look at know the creepy speech of these since something been in a good [Music] way well that&amp;#39;s good it&amp;#39;s really good I&amp;#39;m glad how the game B actually really really fun it&amp;#39;s really wacky but also really creepy at the same time it goes back and forth tonally but like I like both so the [ __ ] is this okay some point what oh oh oh oh oh what oh what oh what hello that was interesting he was number one I&amp;#39;m going to take the hand too oh it&amp;#39;s a doorknob how he do Sharky getting insult the biggest insult ever is your down bed for Wesker you know what ter person Wesker is in no you can&amp;#39;t [ __ ] fix him no have you ever actually successfully fixed anybody ever you can&amp;#39;t let it go it did lead to a pretty funny joke the other day though you can&amp;#39;t fix me I&amp;#39;m perfect yeah and [ __ ] apparently [ __ ] shy looks at that goes oh that&amp;#39;s Bae mhm what do you mean I have to clean up my inventory I saw for 2 seconds I was sitting in my little computer chair it was my gamer setup I was just about to get down and valerant with some homies then aah ruined everything yeah you probably didn&amp;#39;t recognize his voice cuz he didn&amp;#39;t sound like a [ __ ] cartoon character he actually sounded uh oh pretty normal you after a while I think it&amp;#39;s a pretty good representation to be honest you can&amp;#39;t hide forever complete Global saturation and the war actor is not a shitty person like DC Douglas oh so I could have done this anyway until I went to that side nice to meet you oh oh oh man I haven&amp;#39;t had to do that motion since a Dragon Ball Z game on the PS2 [Music] interesting I don&amp;#39;t like these noises come here CLI ow I&amp;#39;m

but omitting statement chose deception odd in a town where it rains so much well the people here rarely go out in the rain I moved here during high school and I never really understood why can you shed some light on this Geor oh oh oh oh oh wh what the what what just happened hello are we good um um the game just just are we fine are we still present the game just totally messed up yeah the game just like froze really badly and it froze my entire computer there for like a hot second that was that was a little spooky I thought of my I I only thought my game like my computer was about to crash that&amp;#39;s what I thought was going to happen um yeah I think we got to restart maybe yeah I think I got it not not my computer but restart the uh game cuz the game game definitely freaked out there yeah that was interesting B yeah no kidding it&amp;#39;s not even I have to Tas manager it it&amp;#39;s really giving me that it&amp;#39;s given it&amp;#39;s given old PS3 Vibes for your game which just freeze yeah well that was interesting yeah that was scary I thought my whole computer was going to crash the way it was acting but gu not this girl is looking at you I feel like you would make the joke that no girl would look at me or something like that no it&amp;#39;s really like TR pigs lots of peee modules peee peee mod the girl in the game listen I would ask if it would kill you to be nice for once but the answer is honestly yes so I understand BR this was the thing I was I was loading up yesterday that I was telling you late at night I was like hey this is taking an hour and a half so like um is everything okay I just restarted it was fine it said hour and a half remaining and it kept going higher and I was like that&amp;#39;s not normal try to get back in there see how much we have to redo and hopefully that&amp;#39;s not a consistent thing that that&amp;#39;s where it breaks it be funny if we did all this song and dance to get around the steam version that is a broken mess and the this version is also a broken mess that would be tragic previously during the right we are should be right before that final like uh qte with him w can&amp;#39;t skip this we do have to go through it again because we have to hit all of the uh the qts not even like a skip AAL cut scene we can skip this because I already seen it that&amp;#39;s all the information we need Zach let&amp;#39;s go back and show them what we found we can do is if this freezes again we might just have to skip it I&amp;#39;m sure we&amp;#39;re not missing like amazing dialogue or anything like that no not that I know of but that raincoat is a little odd odd in a town where it rains so much well the people here rarely go out in the rain I moved here during high school and I never really understood why can you shed some light on this George there we go well there&amp;#39;s an old story folklore it&amp;#39;s a fairy tale to me something about he almost sounded like like like uh Harry there a little bit in his delivery a bright raincoat yeah that was it just a foolish piece of superstition a rubbish story someone made up not many people still believe it but I guess it&amp;#39;s a traditional place so in my heart yeah most of the shops still close up when it rains school&amp;#39;s out too it rains too much in this town you call off school every time it rains not many people ever wear raincoats how do you get through a school year and now the raincoat killer has leapt out from his picture book oh by the way would you two kindly show me your bags our backs is this related to the case the person with the upside down Peace Mark in that photo we found he&amp;#39;s our killer and what makes you so sure about that Zach and I saw him kill Anna in the lumber mill he killed her right in there oh one thing please don&amp;#39;t ask me about Zach That&amp;#39;s A Private Matter yeah you&amp;#39;re inspiring some confidence here brother your backs we can clear up most of my concerns about you isn&amp;#39;t that for the best you do want to remove yourselves from the suspect list we need back pictures of everybody in the town this is insane your methods are rude insulting and out of the question and Emily is a female officer forcing her to show you her back is harassment I don&amp;#39;t care if you are FBI or not you are out of line mhm H George it&amp;#39;s okay let&amp;#39;s just show him and get it over with Emily are you crazy look we flash our backs and he&amp;#39;ll start trusting us a little more just right agent York this is so weird why is this magical music happening it&amp;#39;s just a girl it&amp;#39;s a girl back it&amp;#39;s not not some Heavenly [ __ ] there brother are you satisfied now yes my apologies oh my God there&amp;#39;s a bra yeah yeah okay I can&amp;#39;t refuse it now can I but don&amp;#39;t expect to get your way all the time Agent Morgan your eyes this is a Christian household oh you don&amp;#39;t want to see that George what are these scars just like your Mr Zach something private I don&amp;#39;t have to tell you about it [ __ ] geralt of Rivia out here just like Zach we can understand that right Zach anyway this will make things a lot easier from now on I&amp;#39;m glad to say you&amp;#39;re both pretty much off the hook thank you for your cooperation if anyone is suspicious around here it&amp;#39;s him he&amp;#39;s the most suspicious no I don&amp;#39;t think so but he certainly is the most irritating just [ __ ] stud the crime scene you know what we have to do next SEC George can we arrange to have

yeah I&amp;#39;m not doing that never mind what do I need to be doing yeah what is my current objective just go home for the night that another one of those bones no just go to the community center at night go to the community center at night I thought he said tomorrow I thought he said tomorrow missing something wow you can see how terrible the driving stuff is when you&amp;#39;re doing it from big person wker before the first game yeah totally so where shall we go next that&amp;#39;s it that&amp;#39;s all you had to say so where shall we go next thank you there it&amp;#39;s a sheriff and we&amp;#39;re not the sheriff Co this leading dude the driving is so bad in this game game is hanging a lot too or stuttering a bit and I don&amp;#39;t know why some my wor control on third person yeah which is really weird definitely should not be that way I&amp;#39;m just driving I is it actually like cuz it says limit 5:00 7:00 so is that the next day 40 FPS on switch I can see why I also having a bad time believe this is next d yeah this is takes us back to town go sleep do I have to do I have to sleep can I just stay up all night like a gremlin ruin my sleep schedule in game as well as in real lifez I can do that too finally I can change my my suit hopefully they&amp;#39;ve been [ __ ] trying to keep me from doing that he&amp;#39;s just humming you can tell it&amp;#39;s the game too and not the program because the game like you can look at the game and see it&amp;#39;s like like every time it stutters a bit the the U the miles per hour the speedometer is like flicking so it&amp;#39;s the game it&amp;#39;s so funny to watch wait there&amp;#39;s like a wait did we already get this oh there is a bone thing over here we can go do this back Zach is there something here that you want to check out we need to be at the community center by 1500 today today just think of talking in front of all those people it&amp;#39;s the previous day what do you think Zach it&amp;#39;s going to get fun can I take my gun out or does it just un equip my gun every new chapter yeah there&amp;#39;s another bone thing over here I don&amp;#39;t know if I&amp;#39;ll get them all I don&amp;#39;t know if like I don&amp;#39;t know what my current plan is if I plan to do all the side quests or do just like most of them I&amp;#39;m not doing like a 100% like I&amp;#39;m collecting all the baseball cards and [ __ ] I&amp;#39;m I know that for sure I like to do like a fair bit of the side quests if at all possible cu the game is cool I wish I could just find money around by picking up medals I&amp;#39;m definitely not going to be interested in trying to get this done in a timely manner I do just kind of want to enjoy the video game I definitely heard something behind me like one on either side oh there&amp;#39;s a deer up there or a skin Locker depending there&amp;#39;s a long way to this bone thing first time one shrew get is there always going to be a dog around one of these interesting is it in a [ __ ] Birds Nest this time why is there a bird nest this time it&amp;#39;s a hip bone we&amp;#39;re trying to make a whole person here a human bone this doesn&amp;#39;t look related to the case but shouldn&amp;#39;t I let someone know you didn&amp;#39;t let somebody know the first time kind of left it brother I go all the way the [ __ ] back I guess it&amp;#39;s supposed to be like a bird flying by or something like how it&amp;#39;s like I was like a little bit demotivated to explore and go around and then now it&amp;#39;s night time like hell yeah now we&amp;#39;re exploring and now we&amp;#39;re rolling around because my time things are better so mad I didn&amp;#39;t do it is actually a really good reward yeah this is the right way good good I was afraid I went the wrong way and this is uh taking a bit use Sprint burst Sprint burst is faster this is awful I&amp;#39;m hly glad about that that was one of the things I was like worried about is that the combat would be frustrating and the combat is a little bit more on the uh Dy side but like I was like where&amp;#39;s my car honestly I feel like the combat was frustrating this game but it would not be a fun game so I&amp;#39;m glad they played it safe yeah I&amp;#39;m glad they played it safe and didn&amp;#39;t uh make it difficult the Ambiance is so cozy that you get in here and it just starts playing like really like like a really weird like [ __ ] soundtrack and I&amp;#39;m like shut up go save closed but there&amp;#39;s not even any clothes in [Music] there yeah we have a definely a lot of free time hey welcome to welcome to how I uh welcome to how I see life I&amp;#39;m just like nighttime is that just more free time reality it&amp;#39;s more work time for example I&amp;#39;m going to Ed be editing YouTube after this stream so yeah it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s more like work time but hey night time is more worktime if I just don&amp;#39;t sleep more work time easy peasy I like I sleep well anywhere not missing out on much oh there&amp;#39;s one right here another one of the bones we&amp;#39;re bone gaming what&amp;#39;s up here though interesting yeah this is like one of the easier ones right foot bone huh that look like a foot a human bone yeah yeah shouldn&amp;#39;t I tell someone hey you probably should oh what if I don&amp;#39;t and I just hold it to keep it to myself until I get the entire skeleton I guess you can also do that it&amp;#39;s just not a good idea now we&amp;#39;re back to driving it is still very goofy that this goes one to one with uh we go one to one with normal time wait this this doesn&amp;#39;t go anywhere wait a minute I thought I was going back to town what the [ __ ] where am I going hold on people turn around or like a PS3 game I was noticing that like I was looking at the uh I looking at the sequel as well I was looking this up and it&amp;#39;s like that came out way way wa way way after way way way after the first one they don&amp;#39;t have much to say at night for whatever reason I love that it&amp;#39;s this is literally just the game like it&amp;#39;s not it&amp;#39;s not like it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s not the program because like this monometer is flicking between zero and 40 if it was just like lag it would it would um it would stay at 40 and just stutter a second no it&amp;#39;s literally the game just not functioning right which is very funny I&amp;#39;m guessing the town hall is in town so I might as well just go vaguely that direction we did get the bone by going this way though so it&amp;#39;s kind of worth it that&amp;#39;ll make our life easier later what are you doing driving out here tonight it&amp;#39;s not normal speed does that no that&amp;#39;s kind of terrifying it definitely should not be doing that I was just talking about how like I don&amp;#39;t have the gamer have the gamer stance when I&amp;#39;m playing with the controller and I was just doing it anyway oops oh gosh I&amp;#39;m I&amp;#39;m up on the I&amp;#39;m up on the [Music] side York is not very interesting T night his talks are kind of boring he whistles and calls it a day okay where did I go wrong here do I stay on this road think I stay on this road we&amp;#39;re going through the tunnel secret tunnel under the mountain or do I go there hold on this is a good time to check before I end up going to some other weird part of the map well there&amp;#39;s a bone to our left here though there&amp;#39;s a bone to the left and that goes back to town yeah yeah good thing we checked car stamina yeah you can just break down your car entirely this really just dog simulator you&amp;#39;re just like go f the Boon go fit the Boon why can&amp;#39;t I sleep in random places around this town what that a thing it lets me do about say if this is close I was going to be so sad I mean is picking up a bone in the cemetery really a weird thing or is it like isn&amp;#39;t that exactly where it should be okay maybe behind the lumber pile back there not so much but what the [ __ ] man I need to get in there why is this all chained up illegal hey going the cemeteries T night

you see the diner closes when it rains many shops do that around here as you might have heard anyway Anna always seemed unfocused the day after it rained and came in late too it was almost as if she

lightly like it&amp;#39;s just another case I never take anything of this nature lightly I assure you I&amp;#39;m here to apprehend the perpetrator who did this yeah because local enforcement can&amp;#39;t shine their own boots right good point you can&amp;#39;t always count on the police now can you but that doesn&amp;#39;t mean you&amp;#39;re going to capture the perpetrator yourself Quint how do you know my name I memorize the name of every citizen before arriving in town I also know about you and your significant other you mean Becky don&amp;#39;t underestimate the FBI was that

brother sad so sad I totally agree that&amp;#39;s why I&amp;#39;m here looking for the one who did it were you close to her Anna her smile so warm Anna blonde hair so bright there&amp;#39;s a graveyard somewhere in town Zach excited about the idea but maybe we should at least check it out we&amp;#39;ve already been there I think we Agent Morgan I&amp;#39;d like to let everyone go home now let&amp;#39;s go outside I thought we were getting dinner I&amp;#39;m hungry I don&amp;#39;t let the special agent eat that guy can&amp;#39;t be real whoa whoa whoa don&amp;#39;t don&amp;#39;t leave your armed Arsenal on the desk there brother Wesley go back and get it it&amp;#39;s [Music] dangerous money you get have paid a lot doing this I&amp;#39;m in the wrong line of work to be fair I don&amp;#39;t think I&amp;#39;ve ever worked a well-paying job in my life but apparently this is the way you go well then agent York do you have any plans for this evening I was going to head back to the hotel and go over my notes I need to contact HQ and give a progress report too okay then let&amp;#39;s call it a day here sounds good contact my office when you finish your report we&amp;#39;ll pick you up Tom they wanted to have dinner with you the owner of the art gallery should be back they wanted to have dinner with you don&amp;#39;t stand them up hold on agent York we&amp;#39;re going out to eat at Nick D he would you like to come with us yes I was going to go there this morning and I got CED is a great cook but Nick is the real deal no visit to Greenvale is complete without eating at the A&amp;amp;G a very appealing proposition Zach what do you think we can always go back to the hotel after eating dinner or go directly back to the hotel you decide Zach oh we&amp;#39;s that eat with them eat with them eat with your homies come on [Music] now why didn&amp;#39;t why are we in separate booths I&amp;#39;ve been Sheriff here for a long time now and this is the worst murder I&amp;#39;ve ever seen stop talking our town is a little odd in some ways but it&amp;#39;s usually a peaceful place we had our fair share of cases but just the regular stuff a high school kid shoplifting from The Milk Barn maybe or some hot-headed kids fighting fueled on liquor nothing more than that agent York what kind of cases have you dealt with in the past not much different from those you&amp;#39;ve just mentioned the case I was on until last month well the guy killed seven girls in a three-month period I don&amp;#39;t think that&amp;#39;s the same he sawed their heads off from the neck and took them back to his house he cleaned the skulls up and used them as utensils in his daily life to eat from or it&amp;#39;s Bubba as a urine cup he hated women that was his way of dealing with it he&amp;#39;d fill skulls with ice Cola and rum then he down it in one Gul this is like when it&amp;#39;s like talking to somebody who&amp;#39;s only personality is True Crime the question of his mental state was the pivotal point in the court case oh man for me he was insane 100% drinking from the skulls well that is one thing but but those he had used to releve himself you would then just use them to drink from too that&amp;#39;s just gross not s that was too much for me I ex said the same thing not San like what I repeated Leon before he even said it that&amp;#39;s probably not the problem for most of us what else ah yes an in over 800 victims this is not something we should be playing goofy music over let&amp;#39;s talk about something else you don&amp;#39;t want to hear anymore that&amp;#39;s a shame isn&amp;#39;t it Zach I was just about to get to the good part too sounds like you live in a totally different world I mean you&amp;#39;re like what you agent who just jumped out from a movie or something in your eyes we must look like we&amp;#39;re just playing cops and robbers I give up I can&amp;#39;t compete with you don&amp;#39;t say that Emily oh the cases you have solved are all full-fledged crimes a crime is a crime Size Doesn&amp;#39;t Matter there is no big and small crimes always have a oh thanks I appreci heading to bed thanks for being nice to listen to smile have a great night you too bud I appreciate you have to give me 200 bits I appreciate that though no matter what it I really do hope you rest well thank you it more kind than I Des there is no difference in size well said Agent Morgan we work day and night to preserve peace peace and order in this town you understand that right maybe one day I&amp;#39;ll have a cool handlebar mustach like you but still I don&amp;#39;t view shoplifting and Anna&amp;#39;s murder as the same level of crime me neither certain level of vanity going on here I never even dreamt that such a thing could ever even happen in this town I keep on how you think this game is ter here in this Diner waiting on tables no there he goes cry excuse us Agent Morgan we should have made dinner a more uplifting experience let&amp;#39;s call it a night okay good night then can of tomato sauce to lift in the mood I have no limit do whatever I want usually tomato sauce is paired with something to just saying just telling me to go back to the hotel since the game has rose up and crashed on us uh before I&amp;#39;m going to save before I drive out there just to be extra safe you can go inside the bank oh nice oh well red buildings we can go into maybe we go in there at some point I&amp;#39;m going to save before we go over there now we will right back hey wait a minute I thought everything was closed when it rained brother it&amp;#39;s raining and the diner&amp;#39;s open well it&amp;#39;s closed now look at all the lights are still on everywhere y all Lon y all a lion think we go straight ah Z if you notice anything just stop I love the super wide turns so funny he does it tell us on the hold on I&amp;#39;ll check this next time we save cuz is there like a chapter count in this game like is cuz I&amp;#39;m pretty sure I saw that whenever I say was like we&amp;#39;re on chapter number something something that&amp;#39; be a good way to also see how deep you are into the game is like what chapter I&amp;#39;m on out of total chapters in the game well there&amp;#39;s only one car noise so my car sounds the exact same as that one so they just synced up there for a minute 27 chapters that&amp;#39;s a lot that is a lot of gaming a lot of gaming somewh ridiculously St I see it&amp;#39;s weird it usually doesn&amp;#39;t make us um make us come back to the uh Hotel so I wonder if that new person that&amp;#39;s staying there is the reason we&amp;#39;re here no we just have a CO cut soon okay then Zach let&amp;#39;s go back over our progress first the victim Anna&amp;#39;s death she was found hanging tree in the forest she was cut open with a knife from her chest down to her stomach that was the direct cause of death the strangulation marks and skull fracture were caused after death her tongue is also bit off and I found something inside her mou do you remember what that was Zach oh why am I having to oh [ __ ] I don&amp;#39;t remember oh [ __ ] the red seed yeah SE according to El it was raining when was killed but traces of Tears were still EV on face which means the perpetrator killed Anna under a roof in the lumber and then carried her body into the woods after it stopped ring we found numerous important pieces of the sign of the crime a total of four things knee prints in the grass a wood ship with metal dust photo of a man with a tattoo on his back and one other thing do you remember what that was why am I being quizzed right now uh at the other one is a stiletto heel that&amp;#39;s right a broken stiletto heel we didn&amp;#39;t find the shred of Jack we actually EV suggests that two people came into contact with Anna&amp;#39;s body prior to it being discovered by us and somebody didn&amp;#39;t report it those being the perpetrator who killed Anna Miss stiletto heal there is also the possibility that a third party carried on to the woods that means we could be dealing with three people two or three people in any case MTO heal may have Vital Information we need to find her next we didn&amp;#39;t use forensic methods but we&amp;#39;re still closing in on the criminal yeah have I forgotten anything of course so why stop quizzing me the marks on her hand tell us that Anna was gripping something when she died do you remember that Zach what do you think she was holding on to oh I get a choice that&amp;#39;s right a round object marks on her hand suggest aace the man in the photo found in the woods had a tattoo of an upside down peac mark on his back these two could well be related how could you hate this game we don&amp;#39;t know for sure next the town folk a few are worthy of special attention Carol mlan the singer and Bor owner she&amp;#39;s Thomas&amp;#39;s sister then there is Nick cormack the owner of the diner both of them seem to be hiding something there&amp;#39;s Diane the owner of the art gallery who&amp;#39;s out of town then we have problematic old rich and eccentric Harry both will be tough to crack well we just have to go one by one I&amp;#39;ve been thinking one of the biggest rewards here is the Fantastic food enjoying food is cultural and yet it&amp;#39;s also a bit uncivilized coming in it&amp;#39;s interesting how good food motivates me to work harder during investigations who motivated and on Emily&amp;#39;s back imagine being motivated at all it was strange to me hey don&amp;#39;t take that the wrong way Zach I wasn&amp;#39;t getting all excited or anything but it did make me feel strange nostalgic and sad almost starting to rain I think this case may take a while em em I&amp;#39;ll eat later interesting you&amp;#39;ll eat right now interesting you need to listen to your mother I want to hear the rest of the story eat your lunch

that&amp;#39;s horrifying who she is are you looking at the same photo I am perhaps maybe a granddaughter might be worth asking her that&amp;#39;s [ __ ] terrifying look like an analog horror creature why is her bed so [ __ ] huge why does Mima need such a huge [ __ ] bed maybe this is what she was looking for ridiculous yeah you could fit like five people in there he does not need all that space Oh I I didn&amp;#39;t mean to come out here good morning Agent Morgan come out here sleep well morning George Dreamland was quite nice you do look well rested I was up practically all night doing paperwork Thomas helped me out so I was able to go home and get some sleep but training money the electric B must back into town late last night we should give her a visit which means going to the art gallery correct she lives and works in the office there so it&amp;#39;s the only place to find her the Galler is open from 10 to 1700 time for some art appreciation a cultural activity in such a small Countryside Town amazing Zack what that creepy smile of this go back in ah [ __ ] no I want to do the side quest but I also don&amp;#39;t want to ditch them again cuz they got really pissed when I uh they got really pissed when I ditched them last time so what we&amp;#39;ll do is we&amp;#39;ll just load we&amp;#39;ll just load and um we&amp;#39;ll just load grab the go grab the the portrait right away since we know where it is and then run over there during the I know I know I know I know so that&amp;#39;s all the way up here yeah cuz I didn&amp;#39;t know that door went outside I was just like o openable door where does this go and then I got locked into plot into the main plot and I did not want to do main plot doing the side [ __ ] yeah I might I don&amp;#39;t know I kind of want to wait for like a natural break I think cuz if they&amp;#39;re just going to Ambush me the moment I come out of the hotel I might I want to ride with them I kind of have to you [Music] know wait for one of those moments in the plot in the story where like it has no limit on anything you know just do a bunch of [ __ ] there although I was looking it looked like certain things are only available at certain points interesting which is funny because it said some of them were like hey this is only available episode 2 through 4 or chapter 2 through 4 and we&amp;#39;re on chapter like eight and it&amp;#39;s like half these NPCs weren&amp;#39;t even around so it&amp;#39;s like I feel like I missed out on a lot of stuff oh hi yeah hinder the hip bone Polly about this picture oh that&amp;#39;s me when I was young well that&amp;#39;s that what about it Mr Morgan oh nothing forget it the point of that it brings back memories there was a Miss greenvil contest in town and I was so young and daring I entered the contest you see it&amp;#39;s embarrassing just thinking about it now there&amp;#39;s nothing to be embarrassed about you look beautiful in this picture Oho yes yes and the food was just wonderfully delicious so Polly where&amp;#39;s the trophy oh Mr Morgan I never said that I became Miss greenvil there were no trophies for second place you mean this pretty girl in this picture was second place the r first place the are you serious Mr Morgan it couldn&amp;#39;t be more obvious it was Sigourney soury the lady with the pot now she was beautiful all the men in town were crazy about her well of course aside from my husband that is so oh you should quit smoking Mr Morgan that&amp;#39;s right Polly well thanks for bringing back such a wonderful memory I can&amp;#39;t give you this picture that&amp;#39;s loud but please take this instead he pepper great no that&amp;#39;s one story I won&amp;#39;t be forgetting for a while hey oh so some of the cards are only available by doing side missions I don&amp;#39;t know that might be a good place to stop but I could also use the going but I don&amp;#39;t know the idea of like going outside driving around in a whole other like like going outside and driving on a whole other Mission and like you know what I&amp;#39;m saying and going around and doing more main plot and doing a bunch of stuff like it&amp;#39;s like H do I really want to do that especially like right now like do I really it&amp;#39;s like we already played for six and a half hours of this so far you know so like it might be a good stopping point especially since it&amp;#39;s like uh right at the beginning like right at the beginning of a of a brand new episode so it&amp;#39;s like um basically we could start like fresh coming back in and not get like too deep into what the rest of the plot is so far um you know so let me and also be nice cuz this this uh this game does Recaps so the moment we the moment we come back oh God I I did not like to be all tabed um the moment we come back it&amp;#39;ll give us like a nice little like recap and then it will be all caught up and everything um yeah um yeah so I think

the town much in chapter one because I get so mad at you and I just feel like I&amp;#39;m being yelled at sinner cereal what I&amp;#39;m not I&amp;#39;m not sure if it is I haven&amp;#39;t seen it just see that what oh I forgot how an the car this is weird to be back here wait okay don&amp;#39;t you think there are a lot of goodlooking women in this town what the [ __ ] it&amp;#39;s like heaven compared to the town we grew up in what this is a weird dialogue Prom Queen Elizabeth Scott Mo she could be loyalty with a name like that but you know she was like an actress from a big movie wasn&amp;#39;t she B blonde hair too much makeup interrupt you I got to check the map real quick hey Ste good to see you for that&amp;#39;s Saturday thank you for the whopping 25 did you see that Zach clear as a crisp spring morning FK in the coffee FK ining the coffee which is dalmati man Dalmation man France is something FK yeah thank you so much for that Steve hope you&amp;#39;re doing well today on the Saturday this game for so long it&amp;#39;s so funny it It&amp;#39;s such a quirky game where am I going we have a we have a we have a diner thing here we go up left and is this police station again looks like the police station again yeah if you guys do not remember the premise of this game I we trying to solve a murder um of a young town girl but a lot more weird and [ __ ] going on look at the fact that there is two killers that complicates things a bit and also a lot of like weird Silent Hill [ __ ] is happening but only our character seems to notice it which is interesting gu it&amp;#39;s fairly interesting it&amp;#39;s also pretty campy at points to which is really really funny he we&amp;#39;ll do the dinner thing first just driving on this side of the road here it&amp;#39;s fine I&amp;#39;m in a police car they can&amp;#39;t stop me what are you going to do arrest me yeah I&amp;#39;m with the police I am the police I&amp;#39;m the I&amp;#39;m the FBI baby we&amp;#39;re just going to go in the front door here he just says yeah yeah that&amp;#39;s what I would do if i s away from cont for long time and just immediately came back is there something here that you want to check out well the gallery closes at 1700 but there is no okay what are these I can change my my suit here this wait panda bear why is there what was a panda bear option oh that&amp;#39;s right that&amp;#39;s the name of the shop wait why can we why is there a sword why can&amp;#39;t we buy stuff from in here inside the police [Music] station he&amp;#39;s not here so like he&amp;#39;s not here so like why can&amp;#39;t I buy stuff from him his shop here a little odd why can&amp;#39;t I shave in the kitchen sink that&amp;#39;s so gross I have many questions all right remember the fully out of everything online order like a carry Bridge hello got a new recipe sure iy tell me Agent York you fly all over the country hey you guys are supposed to be in a crime scene so what&amp;#39;s the strangest thing you&amp;#39;ve ever eaten good question well this country isn&amp;#39;t really known for bizarre Cuisine so I can&amp;#39;t really think of anything that would knock your socks off but the soft shell crab I ate in Williamsburg was pretty good and then there was the pfish caviar in Mississippi both of those were quite amusing wow just the names sound delicious I&amp;#39;ll have to pass if all he can say about them is amusing Emily I&amp;#39;ve eaten some pretty strange things myself you know you George such as fried cicada interesting interesting isn&amp;#39;t the insect of course it was pretty good too population in these parts tends to expl no or so it&amp;#39;s a special recipe for such times that&amp;#39;s the mind of a psychopath was infested with cicas I&amp;#39;m glad to say I haven&amp;#39;t experienced this cicada population explosion which means it&amp;#39;s been at least 10 years since George last tasted cicada let&amp;#39;s hope this population explosion doesn&amp;#39;t happen while we&amp;#39;re here Zach yeah that right there is the killer sorry George nobody eats bug just saying we have a uh we have like a market for uh like a like an exotic Market or an international market I think is the proper term we have an international market where I live so they sell a lot of stuff like that but that whole point is that like you know it&amp;#39;s food from all over the world so you can buy poooky stuff like that and if you guys remember last time we left off uh I was uh in terms of like what I think is going on is so our biggest our biggest clue is that the um our biggest clue is that there&amp;#39;s a person with a upside down PE sign tattooed on their back that is one of the killers uh however however we have confirmed that uh there&amp;#39;s more than one killer or at least the killer has an accomplice I don&amp;#39;t know if they&amp;#39;ve actually done the killing themselves but they have an accomplice at the very least so essentially what we are trying to do trying to figure out at least one of them and I think that one of these has to be a uh has to be one of the police to recap members the movie was the fourth sequel of the series that started in what movie that&amp;#39;s right it oh no oh no Lex Luther was back was played by Jean hman must for all us fans I don&amp;#39;t remember much more about it though I&amp;#39;m sure there was more trivia about it still forget four Richard Don directing one and two now those two were great movies Christopher ree really shined as Superman actually Zach we&amp;#39;ll finish our chat later yeah let&amp;#39;s let&amp;#39;s take a walk around here Superman question piece is not worth talking about hello dress Clos we can&amp;#39;t visit people what well that&amp;#39;s actually kind of su somebody has 10 m bullets and their [ __ ] mailbox that is weird who is this whose house is this okay just stands there Went Done York is a killer that&amp;#39;s always like a a Twist you got to be prepared for that like the person you&amp;#39;re playing as is involved I don&amp;#39;t know this game would do it but that is a uh yeah just out here [ __ ] why is there 10 me your bullets just out in people&amp;#39;s mailboxes this Whole Town&amp;#39;s in on I guess that was the most like old school cartoon bunk bunk you could probably give hello take your [ __ ] hello so somebody let me in and now they&amp;#39;re gone am I about to get murdered that is really nice not good funct way to just have your microwave just out on a corner like that wait we haven&amp;#39;t met this person Anna where are you going he&amp;#39;s just standing there menacingly oh oh well this is an awfully important house to find do you know where Anna is Anna my dear Zach let&amp;#39;s do this later I don&amp;#39;t think we&amp;#39;ll get anything out of her like this we picked a really we picked a really important House St to come in let&amp;#39;s just not literally we can&amp;#39;t just got run upstairs we can get a card why did that have a a sound effect behind it it kind of does you&amp;#39;re not wrong BR too she was reminding me of uh aand with her where is she where&amp;#39;s my girl I was like oh no not into this again please why is there main bedroom downstairs where are we going to find this key that we need to open that oh hi Quint oh just thinking man okay well bro oh I guess we don&amp;#39;t get the key in there to whatever that is I mean it it&amp;#39;s just a card that&amp;#39;s free money but like it&amp;#39;s not a not a huge deal not a huge deal no no no okay said most people are bars and shots where&amp;#39; my car go wait what why did they take my car away what the [ __ ] well that&amp;#39;s lame now to run everywhere good for my cardio though I guess oh wellow it&amp;#39;s got [ __ ] to do as well it&amp;#39;s a car it&amp;#39;s an anim an object what&amp;#39;s it got to do polish its tail pipe the the ghost parked it for you oh spooky valet like how it&amp;#39;s not even back at the police station so like where the [ __ ] did it go God that feels so much worse than third third person somehow what did I hit there exactly it said it showed me hitting something but I was driving food in here standing SP wait what what why am I over here I thought where I parked I parked in here why did it teleport me over there I&amp;#39;m scared and confused he I&amp;#39;m working here you can&amp;#39;t just Str into a Chef&amp;#39;s Kitchen I&amp;#39;m the FBI I do what I want then perhaps you would give me your permission to enter what am I a vampire no get the hell out of here oh it&amp;#39;s this [ __ ] Zach everyone has their own Sanctuary let&amp;#39;s leave him in his that was very oddly if that&amp;#39;s philosophical did not expect that out of this game I&amp;#39;m going to use that on someone everybody has their in sanctu leave them to it oh a c yay I didn&amp;#39;t get actual coffee I got a picture of coffee that&amp;#39;s free $200 though so we take that I don&amp;#39;t like that this emergency exit is locked that that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s a hazard that&amp;#39;s that that that&amp;#39;s a [ __ ] Hazard that is not that is not safe it&amp;#39;s just all right did it take my car away again no it&amp;#39;s actually here this time hey Justice good to see you H me for your Saturday stream no exits that&amp;#39;s a diner guaranteed yeah I don&amp;#39;t know how I don&amp;#39;t like the fact that this controls worse and person but I was also kind of tired of just being stuck in a box so you know as you do picking up from where we left off to the movie was the oh my gosh we get it that&amp;#39;s right Zack it was Superman 4 Quest for Peace Lex Luther was back was played by Jean hman that alone made it a must for all us fans I don&amp;#39;t remember much more about it though I&amp;#39;m sure there was more trivia about it still forget four Richard Don directed one and two now those two were great movies Christopher Reed really shined to Superman actually Zach I&amp;#39;ve got a confession to make promise not to tell anyone because I&amp;#39;d be really embarrassed I actually like the first two Superman movies more than the first two Star Wars movies W John Williams did a better job with the theme song for superman but whenever I try to hum it it always turns into the Star Wars song somewhere along the way I know it&amp;#39;s strange Zach I know so which Richard Donner film do you like the best no need to hurry take some time to think it over okay we good you done you done Bud okay why is there just a dog in the middle of the road g g you&amp;#39;re going to get hurt or don&amp;#39;t up to you cover in bar wire this game steadily premonition it&amp;#39;s kind of like a uh whose house is this all creepy like in here we&amp;#39;re just trying to solve a murder is pretty interesting uh but it&amp;#39;s also kind of like campy at the same time it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s a good one mix like serious and campy it&amp;#39;s pretty fun sound so [ __ ] big what&amp;#39;s this thing this little notepad icon what that we have a legend might end up going this way super far away though yeah my only complaint about this game is the fact that you do kind of have to like have the map up at all times which isn&amp;#39;t the worst thing in the world but I wish you could like set a way point instead of having to constantly check your map it&amp;#39;s immersive but it&amp;#39;s like I want to be immersed you know ersing in a emerging in a fun way is cool kind of like how like you know stuff like stardy Valley is is kind of like a farming simulator like if you were a farmer but they wouldn&amp;#39;t make you like [ __ ] do your taxes in the middle of that it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s true immersion yeah scream know I play this I want to see every Richard Don movie on the day they premiered every single one lost L the lethal weapons series but my favorite has to be lady talk that was back in 1985 same no it&amp;#39;s actually Twin Peaks the opposite more than it&amp;#39;s the story setting that was really good a love story about Cur I&amp;#39;m looking up so the emulator like please stoping the day very romantic don&amp;#39;t you think so Zach they can only be together at DUS right between day and night together as hum for only a brief moment perfect setting for a fantasy movie I just had a thought Zack I really like those movies okay this is not working wait I didn&amp;#39;t mean to get out I didn&amp;#39;t mean to I&amp;#39;m sorry I didn&amp;#39;t mean to interrupt you let&amp;#39;s take a walk around here [ __ ] really yes Z is there something no I&amp;#39;m sorry I didn&amp;#39;t mean interrupt your conversation closes at 1700 but there&amp;#39;s no real reason was of me we need to Pace ourselves for investigation like this okay we&amp;#39;ll just do this he&amp;#39;s quirky it&amp;#39;s different Zach Zach is the the the audience at home Zach was the friends we made along the way you know it&amp;#39;s like Blue Clues he really wants to talk about this I to see Richard mov on the day they premiered every single one goodies Lost Boys belief a weapon series but my favorite has to be lady Hawk that was back in 1985 same year as goodies both power and Michelle F really Shin in that but more than anything just the story setting that was really good a love story about a cursed night that changes into a wolf at night a cursed that changes into a hawk during the very romantic don&amp;#39;t you think so Z they can all be together at us right between day and night hey Scout how you friend how&amp;#39;s your Saturday I just had a thought Z I really like those movies that have been been changing into ANS can you tell which movie I just remembered that&amp;#39;s right zasia kinsky in the lead Ro that was a fantastic movie we talk to this person concentrate on driving we&amp;#39;ll finish this later okay he he finished this conversation at least who there&amp;#39;s a card here can I get to that though no it&amp;#39;d be easy to just like walk over this but costume L today this early [ __ ] you&amp;#39;re ready way ahead of time have the reir twins yes aha I figured y free money closed I just peek into their house they got a nice house what oh I can just peek

that&amp;#39;s intriguing what the [ __ ] Richard hey leave me alone and Catering the killer okay hey bro okay we get a new suit let&amp;#39;s go it&amp;#39;s amazing you got accessorize spiritual map what is this hey man the spot on the map is called cop&amp;#39;s tunnel it&amp;#39;s one of a couple of places in town where like spooky stuff happens okay I&amp;#39;ll tell you a story okay man brother but uh don&amp;#39;t go spreading it around Spirits they don&amp;#39;t like publicity [ __ ] is happening back when this place was a lumber Kingdom what the rock and80s that tunnel was the main connection from the lumber yard to this town every day huge trailers would like come in and out lots of traffic dude of course some people were like all up in arms save our nature stop pollution you know big business was pushing in here from all over the USFA everyone was bickering over the forest so some of the Town people got even more worked up you know they started a protest inside the tunnel itself I guess maybe that was the start of all the bad times bad times oh yeah man rough stuff and heavy times man the conservationists and the lumber workers faced off with each other neither side was backing down and that made things worse amid all this chaos there was a man and a woman who got engaged the problem was that the man was a lumberjack and the woman she was a tree they rarely ever fought but then one morning they had a lover&amp;#39;s quarrel cuz they&amp;#39;re ideally against each other nature clashed with his profession yeah you think so but we&amp;#39;ll never know what they really were fighting about that morning the man shouted he called her an idiot and then he stormed out and went to work if only he had known that would be the last word he would ever say to her when he finished his work for the day he got in his car and drove home when he got to the tunnel he saw lantern lights glowing faintly those fools not again he just thought they were protesting in the tunnel again and to scare them a little he decided to speed up he probably thought they&amp;#39;d all scatter so he wouldn&amp;#39;t hit them but the lights didn&amp;#39;t move in fact one came toward him a second later there was a thud and the lantern flew up into the air slam too late of course then totally freaked climbed out to see what had happened I don&amp;#39;t need to tell you who he hit do I what&amp;#39;s more in her mangled hand was a letter to the head of of the lumber mill a peaceful settlement offered no the woman had no other relatives other than the man and the lumbermill took no responsibility for the accident it was going out of business anyways what happened to the man then no one saw him again some say he killed himself or simply just vanished you know he might still be in the tunnel weeping over his lost love what the [ __ ] some folks say there&amp;#39;s a ghost of a young man that haunts the tunnel I told you it was called cop&amp;#39;s Tunnel right we&amp;#39;ll check this out some people call it corpse tunnel you better be careful Mr FBI if you go down there by yourself okay haven&amp;#39;t done any fishing in this game but that is fine nice them to leave money just laying around like that hard to find out it&amp;#39;s so kooky it&amp;#39;s such like an entertaining way but it knows when to be like kind of weird and serious when it needs to be you know oh is the orange my is the orange my side quest do I actually get a marker I mean to yeah okay I kind of want to do the dog one first or does it just not let us is is it doing this one specific because of the map oh here wait said the back of his car Zack I&amp;#39;m glad I don&amp;#39;t need a warrant to search a dogghouse good one what that [Music] noise play mechanically that is true looks like we&amp;#39;ve picked up a little bonus too we&amp;#39;ll have to give Willie something to make up for this another time okay yeah it&amp;#39;s interesting that his dog inherently goes after evidence it&amp;#39;s a little weird about to keep that in mind it&amp;#39;s just a dog it&amp;#39;s just what he does Fe Jam sure if it&amp;#39;s close can I not get the yeah I do see some on there over there yeah he just naturally does that guys just naturally takes the bones there we go George Woodman bug eating weirdo working thanks SCE I appreciate that hope your s is shooting you oh can how&amp;#39;s this control worse in third person doesn&amp;#39;t make any sense we have Nastasia kinsky in lead role Paul shider direct back in 1981 brother that&amp;#39;s right Zack cat people about a woman who turns into a Le when she falls in love and then eats the person she loves I thought it was romantic Rance right there [ __ ] youas was perfect for that Ro casting her made that movie a success Al McDow as her brother is also a good call he&amp;#39;s like a panther even without any of that special Hollywood makeup now the AL McDow brings another M I&amp;#39;m talking about right Z don&amp;#39;t tell me we&amp;#39;re thinking about Clockwork Orange Mal MDD come on it&amp;#39;s pretty obvious blue thunder came out in 1983 was directed by John B he just totally outshines the hero lire at least I think so I have to say not many people agree with me about Blue Thunder Zach if you disagree with any of my opinions about movies just come out and speak your mind okay just speak your mind going to the spooky tunnel let&amp;#39;s see give it a shot what does that mean he can enter this place at will what is this what we still haven&amp;#39;t explained what this place is and why he can come here just Ohio know what Ohio looks like oh God move thank you I out of range who why is she just Invincible hello weird no [Music] wonder what the what this is so Random it&amp;#39;s just like are just a room full of enemies in this weird Silent Hill World no&amp;#39;s going explain anything what the [ __ ] T ghost man you had a million of them this am h a lot of accidents yeah what a 10 10 mm bullet B so we can just go five more that&amp;#39;s I was thinking I was like wait till the forces is out we should just keep going back this Deadly Premonition kind of like a Twins Peak inspired game Peaks let me okay things are getting kind of dicey water things thank you can&amp;#39;t just face with the bullets that&amp;#39;s cheating that guy was really beefy [Music] that was really beefy that&amp;#39;s a weird one without context root beer you thanks forgive me if I&amp;#39;m not excited to pick up the shovel and stuff like that a lot of [ __ ] people in here why does he have a shotgun and he&amp;#39;s not using it yeah both of them have shotguns but they&amp;#39;re not using them they got even have they even have ammo on them so it&amp;#39;s not like they don&amp;#39;t have ammo interesting we still have a shotgun ourselves these are essentially useless to us oh he is he was trying to use it I saw that you look like a victim oh okay guess I didn&amp;#39;t go well I still do Mine by myself usually turns out okay sometimes I flop it though cuz I&amp;#39;m human I make [Music] mistakes mission a lot of shotgun shells for fact that I don&amp;#39;t have a shotguns like that you know Gravity Falls me it&amp;#39;s like hey this is worthless so it&amp;#39;s weird that he has the it implies there that he has the ability to willingly enter this world he&amp;#39;s not sucked into it like he willingly oh another one another um machine gun I still have the shotgun yeah okay get infinite ammo oh so I should definitely go get that gummies no I am not I almost bought them the other day but I chose not to in line of my favorite candy sour skittles okay so we don&amp;#39;t have any more side quests right now oh we have the we have uh Brian we can talk to so is there a reason at all to use at this point the handgun if we&amp;#39;re just going to have infinite ammo on the other one nothing just my imagination that&amp;#39;s it after all the conversations you&amp;#39;ve had after all the conversations you&amp;#39;ve had that&amp;#39;s uh you&amp;#39;re just going to be like oh just my imagination I went out the other way I meant go this way I went the other way instead H yeah this is kind of the literally the only thing I&amp;#39;m not a huge fan of although there is a bone up here so I might as well [ __ ] get it while I&amp;#39;m here then go back there maybe it was a blessing of Disguise maybe I would have missed this otherwise that was or R I did not intend for it did I fit through that probably that&amp;#39;s way cooler I just realized if I take down both guard rails can I fit the car down this driveway oh the deer I wonder if that&amp;#39;s a thing a squirrel it&amp;#39;s the first time my stamina actually got close to being completely out that interesting there&amp;#39;s always a dog nearby oh [ __ ] there we go just a skull and a bird&amp;#39;s nest as you do as you do a human bone this doesn&amp;#39;t look related to the case but shouldn&amp;#39;t I let someone know yeah you&amp;#39;re not letting them know till you get the full skeleton for some reason you&amp;#39;re weirdo that should be something concerning that you should cover or let them know about in its own right just for its mere existence you don&amp;#39;t have to wait till you get the whole thing you goober again it is York so like getting York to make sense yeah next time there&amp;#39;s a little section like this I&amp;#39;m just going to blow up shoot aart the uh barricade and see if I can just drive down that way this this is very time consuming as is if they didn&amp;#39;t take away in my car that would have been very bad if they took away in my car this time okay what are we looking at right we&amp;#39;re going to go back through be the you know what just cute that I just noticed I notic if you look inside the car you can see the little map that we&amp;#39;re looking at right here that&amp;#39;s like EC canonically has this map it&amp;#39;s not just a uh like a video game thing like you can see it inside this car we can take a your time okay why is the arrow still wanting us to go in there you already did it wonder if I can see from the first person view you can&amp;#39;t that&amp;#39;s why we never noticed it you kind of can&amp;#39;t see it from the first person you can kind of you can see it very clearly oh my gosh hold on I think it&amp;#39;s actually straight up the map cuz like hold on I&amp;#39;m at a weird angle cuz like it&amp;#39;s moving too I think it&amp;#39;s actually the map in there that&amp;#39;s neat yeah cuz that thing in there is moving it&amp;#39;s not just like a a a PNG like I have achieved pasta well welcome in re hopefully the pasta is good Zach is there something here that you want to check out well the gallery closes at 1700 but there&amp;#39;s no real reason to hurry we need to Pace ourselves for an investigation like this yeah called side quest baby why can&amp;#39;t I sleep inside this shed why is this such a weird thing what&amp;#39;s up brother build at the L that&amp;#39;s terrible so sad info Gathering bonus I don&amp;#39;t I don&amp;#39;t think he told you basically anything you mean info Gathering bonus he went wow the main plot of the game is happening cool NE good to know that is code name for the survivors that&amp;#39;s why that is why they hate them okay where do I want to go where do I want to be there a [Music] junkyard we going to go see the gunsmith and maybe stop by the uh lumber yard for a second get all those cards and stuff after that we&amp;#39;ll probably get back on Main block we&amp;#39;ve been playing side quest for like literally an hour is fine I&amp;#39;m cool with that do his does does his license plate say spy fiction is that what that says nothing just my imagination yeah okay this is the lumber area there&amp;#39;s a person here we can talk to and there&amp;#39;s some cards we can get or the junkyard sorry lumber mill is the other place it seems like the key to not having them just take your car away for no reason is to make sure it&amp;#39;s like firmly in the driveway of whatever area it is you&amp;#39;re trying to investigate or else it does just kind of like teleport it oh it&amp;#39;s the general yeah oh hear more about the rainc killer don&amp;#39;t rush rushing on the battlefield will get you killed you want to die be more methodical on your map forever now cool neat I love that a huge amount of scrap metal carefully right here come on a car there&amp;#39;s still plenty of parts to can be use ready to get your hand started you should find useful parts for your car what do you think we&amp;#39;ll talk first now then Young fella how do you feel about your current vehicle my vehicle it&amp;#39;s a piece of crap but I&amp;#39;m not here to talk about that rude how about a little treasure hunt you basically just say this listen up young man my junkyard is actually a mountain of treasure all kinds of treasure this was all voice acting why did we go through it without the voice acting the problem is there&amp;#39;s so many I&amp;#39;ve lost track of where everything is okay you&amp;#39;ve caught on already I can see it in your eyes I need you to head out in the yard and find certain things for me if you help me out I&amp;#39;ll customize strug I&amp;#39;ll for second that&amp;#39;s way what are you talking about didn&amp;#39;t I tell you to shut up and listen to your superiors now will you do it or not I don&amp;#39;t see any reason to refuse well said first I&amp;#39;ll need some low gear Parts with that I&amp;#39;ll be able to boost you have you have car customization E5 go don&amp;#39;t just stand there get going you think he&amp;#39;s going to mind if I just like shoot off I&amp;#39;m sure the sure the war doesn&amp;#39;t mind me just like firing off fire off a gun right next to him C that&amp;#39;s fine so I got to find car parts back here for him some re the junkyard is struggling too many dead cars to load in I guess hey my car that got blown up to death the very opening scene fre $200 though crunchy this will also go faster once I have the uh 10 mm with infinite just breaking apart boxes like that yeah I&amp;#39;m not a fan of that uh yellow Mark it&amp;#39;s going to be on the map for the rest of the game now that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s neat yeah the game is not loading in like loading in this area I guess it&amp;#39;s just all the cars all the dead cars that are here wait observe oh okay he just had a little bit of like reminiscing about like hey I&amp;#39;s in a car accident the beginning of all this I wish I got $20 every time I recalled my trauma that&amp;#39;d be sick are you financially compensated for that just not close enough if I get too close that&amp;#39;s a bad thing so got be careful there supposed to be searching for car parts but I only ever found these well honor badges so far and I found another card hey it&amp;#39;s a general holy not Bill William overbeck for $200 though take those I&amp;#39;ve been over this entire place and I haven&amp;#39;t found this thing that he&amp;#39;s looking for alsoo the game Cool good to know E5 we should make a battleship d there&amp;#39;s signs did he say E5 when he um oh here they&amp;#39;re there oops thought you&amp;#39;re making a battleship joke oh wait what oh that&amp;#39;s unfortunate that&amp;#39;s so unfortunate we just found it too Doo We&amp;#39;re have to do all that all over again oh that&amp;#39;s so unfortunate that sucks yeah it just froze up yeah yeah that area was not running very well so I was kind of I don&amp;#39;t remember lot we saved at the uh we uh we saved at the um at the uh the cemetery so we actually didn&amp;#39;t lose too much l progress us an ulator no it&amp;#39;s a totally normal version of the game totally normal version of the game I&amp;#39;m not a filthy emulator why would I ever do that that&amp;#39;s pirating and that&amp;#39;s bad yeah let me restart this real quick let me restart this quick okay we move the game back up yeah that area was running pretty terribly so didn&amp;#39;t really surprise me that it uh broke there it kicked the bucket but we&amp;#39;ll get back in I think what I&amp;#39;m going to do do differently since we had to um we had a lot to um we had to break a lot of [ __ ] would be to uh go to Wesley first get the get our infinite ammo submachine gun out of there and then come back through and blast all that stuff a lot quicker that would be way way smarter remember so brand to remember when I was telling you about how like I was like wow this thing&amp;#39;s going to take like 2 hours this was the thing I got stuck on the building spu cach it got stuck on that for like 2 hours and I&amp;#39;m was like um hello when I just restarted it was just fine but this is the thing it got stuck on which was really funny like that timer where it say like 42 seconds it just kept going up and up and up and up and I was like will be on your map any probably will be unfortunately probably will be unfortunately come on now come on let me back in let me play the video game there we go thank you yeah I think I&amp;#39;m going to go do the gunsmith first because it&amp;#39;ll probably have one of those boxes where I can trade out my stuff and then I&amp;#39;ll go back to that area might be smarter [Music] previously during the investigation F [ __ ] in the coffee in the coffee [ __ ] I knew I could count on it never fails the perpetrator bit off anor&amp;#39;s T still so weird a shame but our old time allamerican sightseeing torches came to an end when purple fog covers our town we all wander in hell I FR so says Mr Stewart well there&amp;#39;s an old story folklore it&amp;#39;s a fairy tale to me something about a killer appears on nights she had a red dress on she was a goddess starting to rain I think this case may take a while there&amp;#39;s actually I think it&amp;#39;s so funny that this game&amp;#39;s so cooky and like quirky cuz there&amp;#39;s like actually like a really cool like story going on in the background you know yeah this is where it dump does out there actually is a really good story going on in the background it&amp;#39;s pretty neat all right do a little bit of ret trting here little bit of backtracking I might have to call a flare for my car because no no it looks like it&amp;#39;s still there okay still haven&amp;#39;t actually had to do that yet so okay so this time I&amp;#39;m going to pass the uh junkyard come back for it probably save somewhere in town so we&amp;#39;re a little bit Clos closer that way if it decides to not work well again we can just come back through I like how press X just so we can start humming to himself totally on the way to investigate a crime totally not using this just to get through time a little bit quicker oh I think I missed my turn this is so sad don&amp;#39;t worry everything&amp;#39;s fine it&amp;#39;s not where I want to be wait it&amp;#39;s closed why is it closed when does it open what huh when do you open brother just took down that L post it&amp;#39;s the middle of the [ __ ] day why are you closed it&amp;#39;s literally the middle of the day what H what are your hours brother uh well okay well [ __ ] my idea I guess that&amp;#39;s weird what are what are their hours then middle of the [ __ ] day and you&amp;#39;re not open it&amp;#39;s [Music] bizarre did The Milk Barn have a place like a storage box or did it not I don&amp;#39;t think it did I can check real quick I would hate that that I mean it&amp;#39;s not the biggest deal in the world if I could just do that all again in the same way it&amp;#39;s just a little time con to do all that stuff with the pistol and I might just be more trouble in wors now looking for a store Box Storage Box instead of a wait we already saw this how are you doing boy is it repeating the exact same thing hey Willie wait wait it did it again what we already did this Quest why is it repeating yeah here we are that&amp;#39;s odd put something away yeah put away this pipe now my toolbox is full what the Ping everything hello so does it it does Willie steal our bones every time we come in here it&amp;#39;s a little weird if so don&amp;#39;t know how I feel about that that or it&amp;#39;s a bug I&amp;#39;m not sure Z glad it okay he&amp;#39;s going to do that every single time I guess [Music] interesting looks like we guess it&amp;#39;s a good way to get just like random items you know cuz last time I&amp;#39;m pretty sure yeah we got a sandwich which was completely different so is interesting okay so we do end up being able to do our plan we just had to go to the Milk Barn instead makes me wonder what uh the T of bear hours are and why it takes so long to get open a little weird but we&amp;#39;re good might have to refill on gas soon too we been a busy bee doing all these side quests and stuff just cut through here we&amp;#39;re an FBI agent who cares games may not from platform make you do platforming yeah it&amp;#39;s not the best definitely not the best that equip that machine gun epic bad boy we go to town yeah that that is definitely a worthwhile reward got to go through this whole Spiel again though with him all right time to go through all this again get all this free money like around it&amp;#39;s oh gosh oh your scarf now say hello to my little friend creeps creeps raing me raing me raing me reading me raing Meo yeah oh me thank you so much for the I need to close that tab that I have you in over here cuz I&amp;#39;m not watching myself that&amp;#39;s weird how was your stream friend how did your games go I saw you playing bber good old David King gaming do you have a good time hey Han hey W how you guys are well today R pration yep got a bunch of head on son I was watching well until I started streaming of course but yeah I was watching you were gaming nose breaking stream put him down I&amp;#39;m not going to lie I was running uh head on a little bit yesterday that was super fun I enjoy that pc4 is broken mess yeah that&amp;#39;s why uh I&amp;#39;m just suffering through it and totally not using an emulator to play the game which is way more stable stream streams all right we&amp;#39;re chilling we&amp;#39;re vibing we&amp;#39;ve been mostly doing side quests in this game so far cuz a lot of side quests weren&amp;#39;t really available cuz most of the Town didn&amp;#39;t really exist yet but now that we can talk most of the towns people we&amp;#39;re trying to do their side quest like right now we&amp;#39;re trying to find this this uh heart for General who&amp;#39;s the grizzled veteran guy who looks like Bill overbeck PC port and not an emulator yeah I&amp;#39;m just mine just works better than everybody else&amp;#39;s you know it&amp;#39;s crazy yeah if you guys don&amp;#39;t know the premise of this game essentially it&amp;#39;s a murder mystery kind of like uh Twin Peaks very heavily inspired by twins Peaks um how there&amp;#39;s a little bit of fire left and I burnt my toe that hurts SE yep there he is but it&amp;#39;s actually a pretty cool open world game on top of it you can do a lot of side quests meet the people in the town do things for them you know veryy neat it&amp;#39;s like the perfect mix of like campy but also like cool story yeah know I like it a lot of people don&amp;#39;t and I that makes me sad makes me sad yeah we wouldn&amp;#39;t just move the barricades we got to blast it apart with a 10 10 mm sh machine gun cuz that&amp;#39;s the appropriate way to deal with obstacles all right hopefully the game doesn&amp;#39;t crash again on the way back to giving this to him why do I hear dog noises but I don&amp;#39;t see a dog makes me uncomfortable yeah if I I think this goes without saying if you guys don&amp;#39;t know who creeps is creeps is a very good friend of the stream L to stream a lot themselves so please follow them they&amp;#39;re big stinky they play dead by daylight they play Survivor and killer cracked Wesker cracked David King good homie so please support them please or else or else nothing will happen I&amp;#39;ll just be sad you would want to make me sad would you don&amp;#39;t answer that give him the skull this is it this will save your life someday I will cry I&amp;#39;ll do it you sure know how to exaggerate you imile engine boost is vital for bringing back soldiers alive from war engine boost of course engine boost is the Bas engine boost let me tell you a war story son I don&amp;#39;t care I was leading my unit at the very front line things were bad and sanitary conditions were worse endless gorilla attacks were stripping us of our man gorill everyone was tired to their limits there was one Sergeant who really rubbed me the wrong way I suppos rubbing you the right way the boys like to call him crybaby Timothy he really gave me headaches I can tell you huh just by breathing his posture was bad he was weak slow easily distracted I have no idea who thought he was capable of combat in a war zone he endangered the lives of every member of the unit stomach pains the worst stomach ache Ever every one of us it was just cooking he was using food that was contaminated I flew into the Dugout toilet like an Apache chopper returning to base I have to tell you it was a close call my engine was boosting and that&amp;#39;s what got me there safely right in the nick of time what thanks scps I appreciate that you really want to know you really want to know I can do that with my voice too it&amp;#39;s really cool powerful athletic men reduced to Walking Dead hey I that blinking like crazy [ __ ] pain their confidence and self-esteem are all crushed they almost didn&amp;#39;t recover an interesting [Laughter] story so you see the need for engine boost now do you I&amp;#39;ll keep my side of the promise and get to work on your vehicle that badge on him is for a sergeant looks like it was sewn on something else before it was sewn onto his shirt I like this little like side thing of him potentially not even like being a veteran that&amp;#39;s funny put in longer pistons and optimiz your lower gears that should add boost to your speed when you accelerate but there&amp;#39;s still plenty of stuff I can do to make your car go faster just come see me again and I&amp;#39;ll customize your car a little more hey is there a place to save here does not look like it um think the game I&amp;#39;m jealous yeah you didn&amp;#39;t really get to enjoy it uh we&amp;#39;re going to go into town fill up our tank save and there&amp;#39;s nothing else immediately in that small little town center we&amp;#39;re just going to go do the plot CU I do 11 side quest but we could do a little bit of the plot we have been playing the game for an hour and a half and we have not done main quest anything so it might be time to do that again playing this game makes me want to play like a long like a long form video game for you guys that I like a lot like show you guys some of my favorite games like Witcher or Dragon Age or something like that like a really long RPG just my imagination it&amp;#39;s very it&amp;#39;s really outside my wheelhouse not actually but I mean like in terms of my stream content can you turn the lights on yes you can hey that good to see what is up yeah I&amp;#39;ve been thinking about that lately just playing like a CO game cuz this kind of like scratching that itch but I don&amp;#39;t know how if people would care like balers gate Bal G is a good one start like a fresh save go with it with you guys why you stop making those mouth noises stop being weird give me a Ben Benjamin Franklin or to okay so both her and him don&amp;#39;t talk at least not while they&amp;#39;re at work be ruh okay interesting oh she comes out this time yeah just f up stop no pumping [Music] jokes just great yeah I feel like Ballers would be the smart thing cuz you know that&amp;#39;s the most recent like long form RPG game you know also should save after getting that uh upgrade so I&amp;#39;m going to stop by The Milk Bar and save real quick and then I&amp;#39;ll we&amp;#39;ll head our way over to that uh main quest Point yeah this sounds like tedious but like it&amp;#39;s actually pretty fun to be like okay I got to fill up my tank tank stop by the store you know it&amp;#39;s like it&amp;#39;s very weirdly immersive for such a silly game and it&amp;#39;s really nice actually where shall we go next faor class and race to play as currently my favorite uh like I have two characters I&amp;#39;m playing right now uh there&amp;#39;s a playthrough I&amp;#39;m doing with my my best uh my best flesh friend and I in Elder tonight in that one that one&amp;#39;s pretty cool I like that but like my favorite character that I&amp;#39;ve made is has been a uh Paladin of Vengeance for Bahamut which is really cool um and I might if if I ever do end up playing that online or like on Twitch for you guys I&amp;#39;m just that probably just going to remake that character honestly and just kind of like cuz that&amp;#39;s my solo playthrough that I haven&amp;#39;t touched in like a month it just been too busy been to this place this place is all about you playing Barbarian I have car lag for that I good old car crash oh this is closed okay interesting the house is open though just taking aner see what&amp;#39;s

here&amp;#39;s Wonder W hey Sushi how&amp;#39;s it going bud good to see you friend as you&amp;#39;re Saturday this bit dark game no [ __ ] kidding that&amp;#39;s not happening not spending that money on that so the bar is not even open so we don&amp;#39;t get to investigate that that makes more sense to not be open until evening I like the gunot better play Candy Crush I&amp;#39;m never I&amp;#39;ve never played Candy Crush nor will I ever never going to happen ah I&amp;#39;m sorry I was reading chat sorry it&amp;#39;s your fault get out of the way where shall we go next great choice am I even going towards that like I&amp;#39;m getting far away from that there better be a right turn up here no this seems like it&amp;#39;s just going the opposite way yeah this does not right turn at all I am so glad I checked I would have been driving for a while yeah I would have been driving for quite a while before I realized that that doesn&amp;#39;t go where I want to [Music] go there&amp;#39;s a deer up there yeah we can go do some name plot stuff now to break up the the Mony of the sub the side quest even though I am enduring myself oh I think I want to do every side quest I just want to do them as they&amp;#39;re convenient like if I really wanted to do like a full completion like run or something like that I would probably just do that off stream and not force you guys to watch it oh there&amp;#39;s a bonea over here oh hold up blessing in disguise I thought the game was going to crash there like no I got to be getting pretty close to getting whole skeleton right a human bone this doesn&amp;#39;t look related you need to do 100 it must complete all quests you are the LA the Poncho comes out if I was playing off stream I probably would but for the sake of brevity and not having like a like a 10 week playthrough I probably shouldn&amp;#39;t I mean I have access to the game now regardless so I can play it whenever I want I really am that interested right do a 24hour stream I already do like 10 to hour streams by accident so like don&amp;#39;t temp me it&amp;#39;ll happen we&amp;#39;ll probably end doing a 24-hour stream whenever I&amp;#39;m like close to being the number one xenomorph I&amp;#39;m currently 14 on the leaderboards so what cuz that that number one is like 10K swipes or tail attacks which is crazy I&amp;#39;m only at like 3 or 4,000 something like that somewhere in there somewhere in between so I got to keep grinding that and when we get close we&amp;#39;ll probably just grind it out actually start counting them you know once we H second place we&amp;#39;ll we&amp;#39;ll start um actually keeping track oh there&amp;#39;s a leader board for Killers do exhalation point stats Al and it&amp;#39;ll give you the the site it&amp;#39;s different for each person like um I&amp;#39;m pretty sure like with Zeno it&amp;#39;s just tail attacks certain characters it&amp;#39;s like use of their power um I think Spirits is like getting Downs with like they have to be Downs with your phase instead of just a hit it&amp;#39;s different person to person character to character I do need to eat a snack real quick so let me oh some cookies uh what am I looking for I&amp;#39;m throw away that seel pipe I do not need that I was checking my map that&amp;#39;s what I was trying to do okay so not only is a gallery here so is there there&amp;#39;s a card here as well that&amp;#39;s handy you die if your sleep or hunger I&amp;#39;m not sure I&amp;#39;m not sure how they handle that not sure what the consequence is precisely not sure what the consequence is would tell you if I knew but I do not uh let&amp;#39;s see save over here real quick can&amp;#39;t find me uh CU you&amp;#39;re like you&amp;#39;re putting your steam information and it&amp;#39;s not like showing up or all right what what I&amp;#39;m going to do real quick is I&amp;#39;m going to get up stretch a little bit because I have been playing for two hours just sitting here uh I&amp;#39;m going to make more Rog and stuff and I&amp;#39;ll be right back friends and then we&amp;#39;ll start with main plot things which is going to be our first main plot thing of chapter 2 entirely so yeah that&amp;#39;ll be right there that there bring the water up probably fill my other water as well for for back remember not only getting Rog because it&amp;#39;s tasty and good I am now partnered by them so he was code headache to get a discount while getting Rogue products so they also have non-caffeinated stuff so if you&amp;#39;re not a caffeine freak like I am they still got you there&amp;#39;s a skittles that&amp;#39;s apparently really really good that I want to try at some point although I just ordered the actual the actual energy drinks not like the fuel but the energy drink line that they have Tropical Breeze was pretty good I&amp;#39;m trying to try out their cotton candy yeah that&amp;#39;s a thing that&amp;#39;s a thing okay main plot things main plat things I feel like the the the itch this game really scratches the fact that it&amp;#39;s really [ __ ] cozy it&amp;#39;s a really cozy game hi like it&amp;#39;s a Vibe Game Dude Emily Mr FBI agent made it here all by himself George Emily sorry to keep you waiting I&amp;#39;m going to talk to Diane alone you two just wait out here wow the hell are you saying why why I know I know it&amp;#39;s very rude of me I know but also very important we look good with that beard man I always make sure that I meet with the important ones oneon-one otherwise it&amp;#39;s difficult to sense the subtle reactions of the suspect this is just how I do things and I&amp;#39;d appreciate your understanding go on then you&amp;#39;re not going to listen to us anyway are you you&amp;#39;re starting to understand me George that&amp;#39;s okay George you eat skas so what do you know Lady Diana B yeah I love it so far not going to lie whoa this is freaky looking hello hello yeah no reply let&amp;#39;s take a look around then Zach oh good this game there you go simple easy awkward we just saved outside we don&amp;#39;t need to through all that again who are you what wait hello yeah hello Olivia do you like art yes yes I do well I mean I like trees trees okay ah but I see because these are all tree paintings do you come here often symbolism how we found on no just sometimes I&amp;#39;m sorry I really need to get back to the diner actually was lying about I like trees she said trees not paintings of trees she doesn&amp;#39;t need to come here to see trees there&amp;#39;s tons of trees outside I think this is one of the things I found very interesting about twins Peaks or Twin Peaks when Twin Peaks did this is that like everybody in the town was being secretive and had their own Secrets but it like it wasn&amp;#39;t always necessarily tied to Laura&amp;#39;s murder so like you like they would get on the trail of somebody being super sus and it&amp;#39;s like nah he&amp;#39;s just cheating on his way like it&amp;#39;s not like it&amp;#39;s not actually like he&amp;#39;s not actually a murderer you know so that was kind of it was everybody had something to hide regardless of if it was uh you know have to do with what you were trying to solve what they were trying to solve so that&amp;#39;s kind of what I feel like we&amp;#39;re going to have to sort through bad happen here well nothing illegal difference between shittiness and you know being a bad person and breaking the law not always mutually exclusive right that noise wait did it say it&amp;#39;s locked wait oh okay it&amp;#39;s raining in the courtyard or I can&amp;#39;t leave now okay I was like why is it raining in here Oh weird can I break these well there&amp;#39;s nothing in those he don&amp;#39;t put the poncho on he&amp;#39;s ridiculous you put the gun away brother put it away there you go running through the art gallery with a [ __ ] Tommy Gun a [ __ ] subm machine gun woo hey Cinema I like this game too so far it&amp;#39;s very fun also like T Peaks AR TW Peaks so it&amp;#39;s like you know it&amp;#39;s going to up my alley for that reason hope you&amp;#39;re doing well to day oh there was something in this one good good good good good good good good okay oh this some weird Boiler Room yes I saw that some actually we played the demo for that we actually played the uh demo for that on stream it was really really cool but it&amp;#39;s like it wasn&amp;#39;t really much of a game as much as it was uh just kind of like you know just kind of like watching Twin Peaks and kind of like moving your controller around so I was hoping there would be a little bit I hope they put a little bit more in the way of uh gam play into that interactive it like I would even say that like it quite literally was just like almost like just watching Twin Peaks it didn&amp;#39;t do enough to really like Fring stream burn interesting what is this red usually when there&amp;#39;s a red thing here it means it&amp;#39;s like important but maybe we already got it interesting hey I like d w okay I&amp;#39;m very excited for too yeah they&amp;#39;re just wasn&amp;#39;t enough gameplay going on it was really just kind of like walking around cut scene to cut scene to cut scene to cut scene it really wasn&amp;#39;t a whole lot that you actually did in the demo so I&amp;#39;m really hoping for the full release of that quote unquote game Zach something is still missing we need more clues yeah that is fairly great espe how good it looks like I&amp;#39;m very excited huge steon King fan oh okay we got to go upstairs find more Stu someone found this lady Diane chick so important which is the whole reason we&amp;#39;re here okay so there&amp;#39;s nothing upstairs homie said we need more clues so we don&amp;#39;t even have what we need to go through through that yet oh that&amp;#39;s the door I just came through made it not look like that feel like I&amp;#39;ve Been Everywhere here I&amp;#39;ve been holding my right hand to the wall maze style save time for more salting crackers I mean we had cookies earlier we had cookies earlier but maybe we&amp;#39;ll mix in some Sal crackers here it&amp;#39;s good to see you Beast hope you&amp;#39;re doing well friend on this Saturday Okay so that&amp;#39;s an exit this goes out into this little Courtyard thing but oh we can go up here oh oh what is this room it feels like we should be able to interact with this yeah this open window seems really obvious but it&amp;#39;s not like it&amp;#39;s like we can&amp;#39;t do anything it shouldn&amp;#39;t be a problem yeah there&amp;#39;s no prompt or anything it&amp;#39;s weird that feels like the obvious point of interest in this little room but or this little Courtyard but there&amp;#39;s no prompt or anything so like oh here oh okay so like all right so like that painting is missing and we know where that is so now we go downstairs and bring that up proceeds to open fire I&amp;#39;m interacting violently I didn&amp;#39;t say peacefully interact with it that was your assumption yeah so back here yeah how&amp;#39;s it going friend why why can&amp;#39;t I grab this am I missing something [Music] here yeah cuz all I can do is observe it are you I&amp;#39;m all right a little anxious but I&amp;#39;m wor right yeah if the painting is missing and this is it why can&amp;#39;t I like grab it and take it upstairs what does it want then I know if I&amp;#39;m just like missing something or what talking to low pitch for a minute okay we&amp;#39;ll uh talk way lower when we&amp;#39;re doing this section um yeah I don&amp;#39;t know quite what it wants from me I&amp;#39;m not going to lie to you guys swear never seen that&amp;#39;s a lie just swear to the person that made this game yeah that&amp;#39;s a lie that&amp;#39;s objectively a lie Zach something is still missing there a need more clues there are so many so many references to the show in this game that that&amp;#39;s just like objectively not possible it it would be the biggest coincidence in the world yeah there ain&amp;#39;t ain&amp;#39;t no way as they say there is ain&amp;#39;t no way I I&amp;#39;m I&amp;#39;m incredibly confused I do not know yeah I&amp;#39;m incredibly confused so so it&amp;#39;s saying that uh there&amp;#39;s a missing painting so we we know where the missing painting is but that&amp;#39;s like where the plot is Dead ending or the the quest is Dead ending it&amp;#39;s like hey did you know that there&amp;#39;s a missing painting here yes but it&amp;#39;s downstairs and I know exactly where it is but like that&amp;#39;s where it&amp;#39;s ending [Music] yeah like where is this painting and I go downstairs and I get I get I get said painting and it doesn&amp;#39;t let me do anything with it just lets me observe it just like we did with that oh here&amp;#39;s something [Music] else all right so this is weird I don&amp;#39;t permission to back seat no not yet I&amp;#39;m just kind of thinking alloud I&amp;#39;m not like please help me I&amp;#39;m perilous water thank you yeah I just think aloud not necessarily mean like oh I&amp;#39;m so stuck and I will never figure it out usually when I get to that point I&amp;#39;ll just ask realistically I&amp;#39;ll just be like hey I think this make I I I literally I&amp;#39;m stuck here I feel like there&amp;#39;s just like a door I&amp;#39;m missing cuz it&amp;#39;s telling me at the at the padlock not padlock the key or the the the [ __ ] keypad words it it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s it tells made the keypad that I don&amp;#39;t have enough to figure it out yet like hey we need more clues unless that&amp;#39;s just like a quote that he says and I actually do Zach something is still missing we need more clues usually when he says that that means we haven&amp;#39;t discovered every red thing possible to do the things which is uh yeah usually what that means yeah cuz this we can&amp;#39;t take it [Music] upstairs I don&amp;#39;t know if it&amp;#39;s like we&amp;#39;re supposed to be like counting the number of trees that are in each painting cuz there&amp;#39;s four in the one upstairs and there&amp;#39;s one in that one can&amp;#39;t interact with that but if he keep saying like hey Zach we have no idea what to do yet like that&amp;#39;s kind of like it usually implies that we don&amp;#39;t have all the evidence yet or we actually can&amp;#39;t do the code yet that or this is just like the one weird part of this game where that&amp;#39;s not the case it&amp;#39;s just like the one time that the game&amp;#39;s like actually that we were just saying that for flavor text and I didn&amp;#39;t mean anything in that case uh what the [ __ ] dropped a note in the cut scene yeah but like what what what of it why is that relevant cuz we would still technically have that and yor would still let us solve the keypad correct yeah have we&amp;#39;ve been around this place like I feel like I&amp;#39;m not missing I don&amp;#39;t know like what am I missing here what exactly am I missing here what is the what is the piece of evidence that I don&amp;#39;t have yet that he&amp;#39;s referring to oh hey we haven&amp;#39;t been out here to this one yet yeah another Val thing we look in here ah I see okay just shooting up your gallery hey shouldn&amp;#39;t have shouldn&amp;#39;t have locked me out it&amp;#39;s your fault okay so now hey there we go that&amp;#39;s what we&amp;#39;re looking for that thing right there right see I was going to get it eventually see yeah I&amp;#39;m investigating whether you like it or not this call this a painting that&amp;#39;s rude that&amp;#39;s [ __ ] rude brother a bit primitive with poor composition hardly the work of a master you&amp;#39;re being an [ __ ] strangely though it powerfully exudes a soft warm feeling on the back it says guardian of the art gallery and fresh Strokes so someone added that recently guardian of the art gallery that&amp;#39;s me wouldn&amp;#39;t that be Diane and why is this painting [Music] here all right okay guardian of the iron [Music] Gallery do I have to put that somewhere important what is our reticle doing like our Quest marker what are you trying to oh it&amp;#39;s tell oh just brings me to this Zack something is like look that scary horor the place every time the what what did you just make Brian say okay so we have this painting the guardian of the [ __ ] thing not sure do I have to take that somewhere do I have to take that somewhere is it actively in my inventory cuz I can look at it uh uh PFT yeah fre at Sunset so ABC [ __ ] I don&amp;#39;t think we even see a tree at Sunset unless that&amp;#39;s what is in my hands but then again why would he still say that we uh why would he still say that we don&amp;#39;t have what we need yeah that&amp;#39;s and we don&amp;#39;t even have the painting like actually in our inventory [Music] Never Felt So Good In My UK shirt um Compton represent going to make you her toe what huh are you guys just making Brian say random [ __ ] a master key is what that is for all the oh here it is this is a side quest thing this is even like what we&amp;#39;re supposed to be doing hello [Music] what random stuff random words okay what in the [ __ ] I thought that was part of what we were supposed to be doing is it not but it&amp;#39;s in the side quest section yeah it&amp;#39;s in the side quest section hello now I&amp;#39;m even more confused apparently that&amp;#39;s not something we [ __ ] do what in the [ __ ] oh I&amp;#39;ll sa now that I have that [ __ ] thing I guess yeah I thought like Hey we&amp;#39;re finally making Headway and it&amp;#39;s like nope that&amp;#39;s a side quest thing like oh okay never mind my bad so tree at Sunset we have to look at tree at Sunset which I don&amp;#39;t know what the [ __ ] that is uh one those things are people are just like well it&amp;#39;s so easy because I just Googled it when I played like okay I&amp;#39;m happy that you you just Google the FR but that&amp;#39;s good for you very very good for you is it out in [Music] the okay Rory&amp;#39;s lawn rake really RS really right round and round the rugged rocks the Ragged Rascal ran H is this your pirate reflection time we&amp;#39;re using my stream as your prate reflection time and you&amp;#39;re just saying you&amp;#39;re saying weird stuff why pay for therapy when I could just make Brian say weird [ __ ] why would I ever do that [ __ ] 10 times fast I think Brian is a robot so he will be able to say everything fast about error six okay so it was this painting that we initially found her in front of so now can I because I unlocked cuz I actually observed [Music] it also Brian is a good therapist he says what he is told no that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s the opposite a therapist should challenge you on things that you&amp;#39;re doing that are bad for your own mental health that makes him a shitty therapist actually yeah I the thing is I had not observed that so it did not let me do that like I said there&amp;#39;s no having this I can put it to use I&amp;#39;m taking it with me okay thick moist wet slopping beef in your face hole thick slabs of meat dripping down your gulet we have them you want them get the Horsey Sauce and slather it all over your body raw hot boisterous beef so there&amp;#39;s no way you could have been at the scene of the crime that&amp;#39;s right I was drinking at the bar with Nick until early morning I&amp;#39;m sure if you ask him about it he&amp;#39;ll say the same I am another J be&amp;#39;s reference very well I&amp;#39;ll be sure to do that one other thing that argument with Carol just now she&amp;#39;s always like that she thinks of me as an enemy what I say hope is there any reason for that perhaps because someone she liked ended up with me in my bed that would explain it yes if I may be so bold who was the lucky man oh I sleep with anyone I wish anyone I prefer to sleep with I guess she had her eye on one of them but I don&amp;#39;t know who it was exactly I could sleep with you if you like I&amp;#39;m by your offer but I don&amp;#39;t think that would be appropriate you&amp;#39;re exactly the kind of woman a man in my job should never get involved what&amp;#39;s that supposed to mean York shame darling York what is that supposed to mean I&amp;#39;ll be frank right now you are not a suspect but both Zach and I am certainly feeling shaky about you 33,000 feathers on throat the great Greek great Growers grow great Greek gra lindal Lambert loves lemon Lollipop Lips gloss near ear a near ear a nearly Eerie ear thank you for your help I have nothing further to ask you at the moment goodbye I don&amp;#39;t feel like you got a lot out of that York what&amp;#39;s the point of coming out here I had a chat with Diane she said she was at the bar drinking with Nick at the time of the murder we need to confirm her story let&amp;#39;s talk to Nick at the diner very well Agent Morgan I have to head back to the department and clear up some paperwork time to CH him to the diner okay then I&amp;#39;ll show you the way the diner&amp;#39;s open from 9 to 2100 justce be suspected Zack Diane is the key to this case is she I thought FK she will lead us right to the criminal thought [ __ ] was that&amp;#39;s K speaking of FK looks like the show is just begun and it has an Allstar cast what is he doing here yeah what reason does he have to be here that&amp;#39;s intriguing m oh there&amp;#39;s like stuff back here hold on excuse me Emily wait oh well it&amp;#39;s fine we&amp;#39;ll ride with [Music] Emily we Haven r with the homies in a while actually although George is gone so I mean George is a little bit of a meany head so maybe this is better and he eats thees Emily do you know a man named Forest KAS KAS yes I I know him the the sapling sales he&amp;#39;s a sap he always uses strange comparisons when he talks I&amp;#39;d like to know more about it what does he do when he comes to town he&amp;#39;s a Salesman so I guess he sells things he sells death maybe he comes on vacation we haven&amp;#39;t seen many tourists recently but he comes pretty often is that all well now that you mention it he seems quite friendly with the ingrams with Isaac and Isaiah maybe you should ask them about K okay I [Music] will telling you I&amp;#39;m telling you brother although I don&amp;#39;t know who like okay so I was trying to explain this earlier like an hour ago and I got completely sidetracked so I&amp;#39;m sorry about that um I was talking about like my theories cuz we have uh two at least two people killing hold on I&amp;#39;m going to get interrupted again never mind f it a bit suffocating to be around your so much we aren&amp;#39;t always together anyway gotten used to him impressive women are very adaptable no it&amp;#39;s not like that why is this why you making a gender than George is hardheaded sure but he&amp;#39;s also a hardworking man that&amp;#39;s why the town&amp;#39;s folk trust him so much the very epitome of the rural Sheriff that&amp;#39;s right he isn&amp;#39;t some hotot FBI hey what&amp;#39;s that supposed to mean this place is turn this car around knows everyone else what about you andna were you too close no not close really I don&amp;#39;t seem to have much in common with teenagers now now days all they talk about are boys clothes and accessories I don&amp;#39;t have much interest in any of those things there is a gap between a teenager and being in your 20s everyone&amp;#39;s different that&amp;#39;s all me and you too Z I&amp;#39;m not liking the way this conversation ISC on what is that supposed to mean did he get cold feet was he like don&amp;#39;t hit on me please uh anyways what I was going to say it&amp;#39;s I have my own theories about who the uh so we have at least two killers which has been confirmed or at least a killer and an accomplice at the very least so we got that going um in terms of who I think it is so like we have a uh so first and foremost the only thing we know about the killer for sure is or what we know the most prominently about them is that they have an upside down uh peace sign tattooed on their back um so there was a a little bit of a sequence we had uh in the um in chapter one where we went around all the police uh Department uh characters and we had them show us their backs um oop sorry wrong button so um none of them had it but if they have an accomplice theoretically the person actually doing The Killing can have the tattoo and the accomplish doesn&amp;#39;t have to have the tattoo at all so technically everybody that we&amp;#39;ve checked from the police department um could theoretically here let&amp;#39;s get some gas real quick this game has connect to screen franch does it also but yeah um basically every we&amp;#39;ve checked can&amp;#39;t be cleared so I&amp;#39;m thinking that there&amp;#39;s probably a mole for what are you doing oh I picked Car Wash instead of gas okay this is uncomfortable anyways um I think there&amp;#39;s a mole inside the uh the uh the uh the police who is helping essentially helping the uh the killer get away with it who the Killer is I have no [ __ ] clue but somebody&amp;#39;s definitely helping them and I think it&amp;#39;s one of the people we&amp;#39;ve checked which of the three I&amp;#39;m not quite sure so the kill themselves I have no clue though um I&amp;#39;m s of a few people um I think Dian is a little bit of a red herring cuz she&amp;#39;s like very like you know mysterious and it&amp;#39;s supposed to draw your eye um there&amp;#39;s the uh one chick that I always forget in the leather jacket she&amp;#39;s the only one that actually like spoke poorly of Anna which is interesting um that doesn&amp;#39;t necessarily mean she&amp;#39;s guilty but she is the only person that have spoken in ill will towards Hano so far let&amp;#39;s just focus on getting to the diner and cut the chat oh well oops and obviously I I do like I was mentioning earlier it is kind of weird that Forest dog kind of inherently steals evidence I may be completely overthinking a uh completely overthinking like a side quest but I do think it&amp;#39;s a little interesting that the dog just kind of naturally takes evidence okay it doesn&amp;#39;t matter which which way we take here the general and Jack ring bull you what&amp;#39;s funny I&amp;#39;ve been listening to those characters I never caught that that&amp;#39;s interesting Cinema i l would never have known that yeah those are my like top three I would say in terms of people I&amp;#39;m sus of as the other killer so I have that&amp;#39;s kind of weird I have three and three I have three people I think is the accomp and I have three people who I think is the Killer and between them hopefully I&amp;#39;m right I guess the killer in heavy rain so made me feel happy that I got that raid um I guess the killer in the final pin so that made me feel good so I got a track record up keep here so I hope I&amp;#39;m right the A&amp;amp;G Diner wonder what the A and G stand for any ideas Emily no I don&amp;#39;t know either air and gravity perhaps access and games aliens and Godzilla I don&amp;#39;t think any of this is is it important to know why don&amp;#39;t you just ask Nick true oh I will but first I need to eat wonder what&amp;#39;s good here the Forbidden sandwich huh huh welcome Mr agent hi Olivia let me we have your special for today and some fresh coffee our special today is turkey a turkey and gravy sandwich sound good perfect Emily you eat something too it&amp;#39;ll be on the FBI okay then I&amp;#39;ll go all out I&amp;#39;ll have the T-bone steak she&amp;#39;s like I want everything can&amp;#39;t order it because it&amp;#39;s a little too expensive Nick and Diane why ises he wear a Hardy over his over his apron is it widely known that they go drinking together just the two of them to be honest I don&amp;#39;t pay attention to these things not into local gossip well when I moved here I was still in high school and I kept wearing the same wild clothes for my school in Seattle I was young back then and before I knew it there were rumors all over the school children screw anyone that&amp;#39;s what they said totally unfounded of course anyway after that I just sort of chose not to really trust gossip kind of sad actually I&amp;#39;m sorry I get where you&amp;#39;re coming from do you I used to dress like a hardcore punk rocker when I was in high school I can see that you a punk rocker nobody took my side even when I had good grades I feel that in my [ __ ] soul I feel that in my soul even still I just don&amp;#39;t see you as a punk rocker and you laugh look at you no makeup on dressed in uniform oh he&amp;#39;s getting mad he&amp;#39;s getting pissy okay back to work let&amp;#39;s talk to Nick kind of cute though they&amp;#39;re good homies I love you good question apple and gravy always been proud of a special gravy made with applesauce say place we used it in the name all H is okay him and Diane what that&amp;#39;s it why is the conversation just cut there why is she just not we didn&amp;#39;t even get to ask anything yeah we didn&amp;#39;t even get to ask anything just kind of like just cuts off there interesting you tell us what you&amp;#39;re doing the night and I was skilled the bar Diane did you talk about R brand Turner is that a problem no no problem you think Diane did it you&amp;#39;re wrong interesting so much for the FBI he&amp;#39;s so antagonistic for reason you can tell when people are hiding something by their reactions I tongue and hand movement sweat dry lips neck ankles and such hey hey that&amp;#39;s not proof it&amp;#39;s that that&amp;#39;s just used to guide suspicion it&amp;#39;s not actually it doesn&amp;#39;t prove anything don&amp;#39;t anything get out I&amp;#39;m looking here say the same thing twice he is just an angry fellow very mad very mad what&amp;#39;s her alab buy but could be good I think we talk to Olivia okay there&amp;#39;s something I&amp;#39;d like to confirm with you Olivia if that&amp;#39;s okay yes well so long as it doesn&amp;#39;t take too long first what were you and Nick doing on the night of the murder I was here in the diner Nick said he was going to the bar for a couple of drinks does he go to the bar often leaving you to hold up the fort yes he says he enjoys the conversation with Diane I thought they went drinking again together that night do the three of you ever go drinking together well you see I&amp;#39;m really not into art why and your husband is well versed in the Arts then I take it oh yes um looking at art and talking about it is his way of relaxing people just aren&amp;#39;t what they seem like a certain someone who was into punk rock 10 years ago you are absolutely right Emily but you can be an art lover and a liar at the same time sure one more thing Olivia you just said that you aren&amp;#39;t interested in art that&amp;#39;s right and so how come I bumped into you at the art gallery my question EXA didn&amp;#39;t seem like Nick brought you there you were there alone y i well I like trees is the thing why she been so that&amp;#39;s why I went there surely you&amp;#39;d be better off in the forest rather than an art gallery then yeah uh I think you went to the gallery not to see trees but to to see Diane right you don&amp;#39;t want to answer or perhaps this isn&amp;#39;t the right place to ask she gay meet me in the backyard you can get this from the parking lot I&amp;#39;ll wait for you there for an hour after we close up they close at 2100 should we get something to drink and wait [Music] sure yep there it is do what do we do now I want to hear what Olivia has to say let&amp;#39;s kill time until the diner closes okay then I&amp;#39;m going to make a trip back to the Department I&amp;#39;ll see you in the backyard later why are you bending me okay sounds good why do you hate me see you later then that&amp;#39;s just rude thought we were friends about Olivia I presume she wants to tell us something about Nick and Diane let&amp;#39;s hope it&amp;#39;s not just something for the gossip cols do we have a lot of time commercially yeah although it&amp;#39;s Lally only two tracks like not a whole lot of music going on here yeah we have a lot of time to kill before that players be like I&amp;#39;m at the exate can&amp;#39;t get me save up this phone over [Music] here rest real quick chat I will be in the right back done for I&amp;#39;m coming isn&amp;#39;t that weird part of like Midwest weather where it&amp;#39;s like like it gets super uh like super hot in the day and then it gets super cold at night I just get like all possible weather possibilities at once so that is very interesting right now CU like I need to have my window open all day cuz well hey it&amp;#39;s hot and then like uh yeah like at night it starts getting freezing which is interesting okay what can we do what can we do we can check these house hous is down see if we can talk to anybody we do have a fair bit of time to kill before that we can cycle it right into anytime we want but well it looks like this houses say they aren&amp;#39;t here but we can get this little Valor thing real quick or honor not Valor sorry wrong word is open oh wait this is what&amp;#39;s her Face&amp;#39;s house is it were we already here yeah this is Sally&amp;#39;s house is she better know I&amp;#39;d like to ask you some questions oh hey we can talk to her now Anna oh why did she have to die she was so happy so full of life she loved that dress in the picture so much she looked so pretty in it but now she won&amp;#39;t be able to wear it again yes that dress I can&amp;#39;t find that dress anywhere that dress her dress where is it without it I she looked so pretty when she wore for prop she was the prettiest girl in town that night so why did she where&amp;#39;s that dress where feel so bad for her man I don&amp;#39;t think we&amp;#39;ll get much more out of her like this maybe if we find the dress and bring it to her she&amp;#39;ll calm down enough to talk that sucks somewhere in the house none of these are in this is the laundry room you assume Poss keep it in here don&amp;#39;t know why youd keep it in the garage feel it&amp;#39;s kind of funny to think about that somebody meticulously like you know placed all this stuff you know an observe thing here for a second a prompt okay I just seem going hey cars are used to go places weird y good one dude fantastic observation dor TR is a True Detective here we go there we go one would think you&amp;#39;d find a dress in a closet but there&amp;#39;s too many here we need to find out what kind of dress we&amp;#39;re looking for first how do we go about doing that or she&amp;#39;s too upset to talk unless she can just go ask her slamming through doors in her house how do we find out more details about the dress can&amp;#39;t ask her does complicate things I Fair bit now doesn&amp;#39;t it maybe a picture possibly yes well take a look throughout the house see you Cinema thank you for hanging out bud look Zach ah it&amp;#39;s a picture taken through prite there are no other pictures of Anna in a dress this blue dress here then must be the one Sally is looking for she does look like a goddess Sally was right she sure is pretty that smile would make any man turn to butter she kind of looks like an alien to me but maybe that&amp;#39;s just the orographic speaking I hate that horror noise every time my door is locked it&amp;#39;s really weird I want whatever card is in there Zach this is it this is the same dress as the one in the prom picture let&amp;#39;s take it to s what how find out on her own really just in this closet over here why do she need my help to do [Music] that this this is it the dress this is Anna&amp;#39;s dress this is helping Sally we found the dress so please tell me more about Anna that noise for she was such a good girl she was the most beautiful girl in town with pretty blonde hair everyone around her just loved her on the night of the murder was Anna at home yes I I think so you think so that day the day she died I stayed over at a friend&amp;#39;s place if only I&amp;#39;d been here Anna might not have gone through where did you stay that night uh I was aha so in other words you have no idea what Anna was up to that night that&amp;#39;s wrong she wasn&amp;#39;t the kind of girl that would walk around at night she was always dancing dancing Under the Sun yes under the pouring Sunshine like this oh yeah you&amp;#39;ve never seen Twin Peaks huh [Music] just almost exactly miring dress maybe we can use this to get into Anna&amp;#39;s room sorry Sally but we&amp;#39;re going to have to take a look in there this is interesting I&amp;#39;m kind of shocked it&amp;#39;s not main this isn&amp;#39;t main quest stuff because this is like directly related to the victim you know it&amp;#39;s very interesting okay free money got the card this there just a picture a furn stay in her own room over here interesting why do I have my gun out hello did you have to break it open she was at an age that craves excitement doesn&amp;#39;t matter what town you&amp;#39;re from girls will be girls you know Zach in this wonderful country of ours there are no good oldfashioned towns left none at all during the things that come with quotequote good old Fashions I don&amp;#39;t necessarily uh mourn that one today is the day of the ceremony and I&amp;#39;m a little nervous about it day two the first time he used it on me it was so amazing so exhilarating day three he doesn&amp;#39;t let anything slip I&amp;#39;m really worried about Becky day four Delivery Man Q won&amp;#39;t be able to protect Becky so that&amp;#39;s the last page written it&amp;#39;s very interesting you could learn a lot from a diary so we have this unnamed he Becky and this delivery man Q Zach this could be more interesting than I [Music] thought guess let open it but it&amp;#39;s already open it&amp;#39;s interesting but this is just kind of like yeah this is a side quest this is even like main quest stuff but that&amp;#39;s so important to the plot you know like all of that was really relevant to like the main objective here but it&amp;#39;s just over here is a side quest very weird search that that&amp;#39;s interesting to say the least I&amp;#39;m glad I did that either way save after that that is kind of something I&amp;#39;ve noticed about this um this game so far is that like a lot of the unquote leads and stuff that we&amp;#39;re doing they&amp;#39;re like really like I don&amp;#39;t think off base is the word but they&amp;#39;re kind of like all over the place I like we don&amp;#39;t really focus a great deal on Anna and who she was and like how it relates to everything that&amp;#39;s the kind of the first time we really actually like like dove into that sort of thing that kind of like idea and it&amp;#39;s an aside Quest that&amp;#39;s like completely like you can completely Miss right I don&amp;#39;t know that&amp;#39;s just interesting to me you just ran into me you just ran into a police officer ran into an FBI agent you&amp;#39;re going away for Life brother you I always found it kind of interesting that that part of the story is like mostly just missing we can take a rest if your time I&amp;#39;m assuming the bar is closed yeah there may not be much to do in the this small town square so we may just go straight back and do uh plot stuff I&amp;#39;m just go wait out till uh wait out until that trick software cuz I only go driving like forever away I noticed there&amp;#39;s no traffic lights here I no they are they&amp;#39;re just like some some intersections have them and some don&amp;#39;t it&amp;#39;s just weird weird it&amp;#39;s just inconsistent I guess we&amp;#39;ll go talk to the person okay there&amp;#39;s that thing back here one of those uh honor badges grab that oh it&amp;#39;s on the outside actually got to avoid the green thing just barely can let me squeeze right by let me squeo right by want that pre money over there okay now we can I want to hear what Olivia has to say let&amp;#39;s kill time until the diner closes oh okay so this doesn&amp;#39;t automatically throw us into that see the thing is like I want to do the side quest and stuff but like I don&amp;#39;t necessarily know where to look I you were saying earlier that like a lot of these be find organically because I do want to do the side content and this very clearly seems to be the game going hey go do the side content for a little bit there&amp;#39;s a cart at the end of the street here you can go do that and go fishing that&amp;#39;s true I haven&amp;#39;t done the fishing stuff at all for some reason it doesn&amp;#39;t really interest me in this game I&amp;#39;m not quite sure why it just not something I&amp;#39;m excited for I really wish the car noise was less annoying then like it&amp;#39;s kind of annoying I would much like I would much more enjoy the uh coziness of riding along there&amp;#39;s a card in out in this little area over here go nothing just my imagination that&amp;#39;s interesting one of those streets uh one of those streets uh has my name on it my uh my last name won&amp;#39;t tell you which one that&amp;#39;s interesting smoke away your time I could smoking is bad for you Rosy lips why is that her nickname oh that&amp;#39;s the come on come on oh you know what you&amp;#39;re doing there you got to be kidding me why so just oh no we go on the map that would probably have some stuff to [Music] do car been upgraded I see mhm did that earlier nice that goes literally to the edge of the map so we&amp;#39;re not not going to go that way either we will have to turn around just a blotch in the map that looks strange there is a card at the hotel that we haven&amp;#39;t picked up we could switch our suit there maybe we&amp;#39;ll do that yeah there&amp;#39;s a card at the hotel we have not picked up and we can switch our suit to that nice blue suit that we bought just a little nose Boop see it&amp;#39;s fine the cars are just friends they nozle each other Zach if you notice anything just stop me I&amp;#39;ve noticed after this particular point after you&amp;#39;ve listened to some of his main dialogues you just don&amp;#39;t get anything else the car again for like a whole chapter which is kind of sad cuz those are so like quirky and interesting so the fact that you just kind of like I don&amp;#39;t know fact that they just kind of like run out pretty quickly is kind of sad yeah I wonder what the cart is we missed I wonder that just spawned somehow like progressing the plot into a certain a certain uh progressing the plot into a certain section kind of on that or what hope it&amp;#39;s not one of those weird ones where it&amp;#39;s like well it&amp;#39;s behind a locked door that you don&amp;#39;t have access to yet cuz there&amp;#39;s a lot of cards like that I&amp;#39;m just like oh no I did not hit that you&amp;#39;re a liar the question is it outside or inside can&amp;#39;t quite tell it looks like it&amp;#39;s inside but maybe I&amp;#39;m wrong can you even get around the back of this building that would be worth checking out right I was worried about getting stuck back here but there&amp;#39;s actually a honor badge over here so it was wor com I&amp;#39;m wonder if it&amp;#39;s behind the building or not it looks faded so that sort of implies that it&amp;#39;s a inside but I could be wrong I never assume I&amp;#39;m particularly right about anything I always assume I&amp;#39;m wrong until proven otherwise I feel like I don&amp;#39;t know I feel it&amp;#39;s just a bad mentality to assume you&amp;#39;re right about everything you know stuff I feel fairly confident like if you ask me like History questions you know I have my degree in that so like you know I can probably answer your questions dbd you ask me like xenomorph questions like you know I know a fair bit about that character I probably answer those with confidence other stuff typically better not to assume that you know too much about anything cuz like the way cuz like people get so caught up in like being smart that they don&amp;#39;t realize that how you be smart is by always learning always always always learning okay the car was actually outside okay I am glad I did all this out here first cool I don&amp;#39;t I don&amp;#39;t like you good old [ __ ] good old FK right now we go change or suit no you can&amp;#39;t go in that way surely we can go in through these doors right sure can yeah the way you you actually obtain that intelligence that everybody wants to to like kind of like FLT you know is by uh okay so straight ahead to the left the way you obtain that intelligence that everybody so like want to flaunt and seem cool with is by being always being open to learning and improving when never assuming you know everything possible about something okay it&amp;#39;s been a while since been here it&amp;#39;s kind of interesting all right hey looking clean that actually looks pretty clean I like that that is a good suit that is a good suit let&amp;#39;s go we do have the option to interact with uh the panda bear from [Music] here can I sell things or can I only buy things looks like I can only buy which is kind of disappointing yeah it&amp;#39;s unfortunate I would have liked to have sell some stuff off that I just have in my toolbox but that is not possible talk to poly we haven&amp;#39;t talked to pully at all this this uh part yet see how she&amp;#39;s feeling and thinking oh my God I still love my dear husband even now not like that woman that&amp;#39;s so funny what do you have we have another suit let&amp;#39;s go oh that I I&amp;#39;m collecting Cosmetics POG dude [ __ ] POG [ __ ] POG a lot of food okay I&amp;#39;m going to go ahead and in case we want to like actually do the fishing stuff I&amp;#39;m going to go ahead and get theck St right now do that get more Ru real quick what huh so you can use different kinds of bait to get different kinds like of things other than just all right fish interesting [Music] okay I don&amp;#39;t really want close range weapons there&amp;#39;s not really a reason to have close range weapons in this game I&amp;#39;m noticing the other stuff&amp;#39;s just so good okay I will sa real quick right here okay there is a offish spot out back hello hey Vega good to see you friend how&amp;#39;s your Saturday treating hello was your Saturday friend um do I want to fish or do I want to I don&amp;#39;t really want fish yet I don&amp;#39;t want to fish yet I&amp;#39;d rather explore cuz we have a lot of time a lot of time cuz remember the game goes in lifetime we can skip time and I will skip time at a certain point yeah we will skip time and get there at some point but I do want to take this chance to explore a little [Music] bit fish it fish it that&amp;#39;s my switch box wigs a little frustrating yeah figuring out all that stuff is like so one of the things I am eventually going to do is I&amp;#39;m eventually going to get a new pc cuz this one is pretty old and it&amp;#39;s to the point where most of it&amp;#39;s old so it&amp;#39;s kind of replacing the parts is not very like advantageous to do because so much is outdated might as well just get a a whole new thing a whole new pc and then just sell off the parts um so with that one of the reasons I&amp;#39;m kind of like nervous to doing that is because I&amp;#39;m I&amp;#39;m probably or not probably I will have to set up all that stuff that I&amp;#39;ve done all over again with uh OBS and stuff like that and I do not look forward to that where do I want to go so Tire today was pretty busy how so there&amp;#39;s just a card in the white spruce Farm over here cross the bridge take a left and go right yeah one of the reasons I&amp;#39;m hesitant to bur all over again is the [ __ ] having to set up a bu of [ __ ] again soal help for that day comes and you know vice versa if you need help with anything I&amp;#39;ve honestly had to fight with OBS many many a time so if it&amp;#39;s something that I uh have expertise with I will definitely share 12y old PC wow wow 470 wow there you go yeah I&amp;#39;m still on a 1080 I on an i5 I think my processor is like the oldest part of my PC to be honest with you is waiting me waiting me waiting me waiting me waiting me Yo T Hi friend how are you how is your stream bud hope you&amp;#39;re doing well today in the Saturday Zone let see if anybody&amp;#39;s at this house before I go just totally just ran into that guy Teo him so time with your 960 yeah I was on a 780 before I upgraded so I totally feel that okay where was this where was this card that I was trying to go get hold on while while I&amp;#39;m paused here the perfect time to go ahead and this what some buil for like 1,00 that&amp;#39;s actually an extremely good price that&amp;#39;s extremely good that&amp;#39;s actually extremely good has a 30 3050 in it that&amp;#39;s what I noticing about my uh Whatchamacallit that&amp;#39;s what I was noticing about my uh Whatchamacallit we got to go to the right here about like my PC is like a lot of modern gaming laptops have like nor like specs similar to mine are better and I&amp;#39;m like I have a whole desktop that&amp;#39;s crazy it just kind of goes to show like how technology advances cuz like you could fit all of what I have now into like a gaming PC it&amp;#39;s pretty neat I think it&amp;#39;s just cool to see how technology progresses yeah I don&amp;#39;t necessarily need a new pc technically like I could be fine run like I can still run most games on medium that are brand new but oh I missed my turn um but EV I I am running out of uh I will eventually get ushered out and it&amp;#39;s probably better do that earlier rather than later you know sooner rather than later but oh it&amp;#39;s not even this obviously you know a better and more smoothly functioning PC will obviously be better for streaming not even frame dropping DVD although a lot of frame dropping DVD is because the game&amp;#39;s just terrible to be fair because they opt the optimization in that game is terrible it gets worse patch to patch can play I can&amp;#39;t play Starfield and I really want to I had no interest in Starfield and then my friend Joey was talking the other day to me while we went out for mcdal he was talking about like the space combat and like building ships and stuff and that honestly that just sounded super sick cuz that&amp;#39;s like what got me with um what get get out of there York what the [ __ ] are you doing hello why did you just do that for huh where is this car is it down the well he&amp;#39;s doing his best true r not to get frame dropping yeah they DVD well that&amp;#39;s one of the things that made DVD so widely accessible or why so many people owned it was because uh I use my fishing rout here it&amp;#39;s because like it was easy to run there I was using my Noggin seem so now where is this cart you can&amp;#39;t even go in here it looks like it&amp;#39;s in the well but how do I get in the well yeah pepperoni can you he any HS I don&amp;#39;t know how that would work I don&amp;#39;t [ __ ] know oh well this is what I&amp;#39;m confused about like there&amp;#39;s some cards like this where it seems like like you don&amp;#39;t you just don&amp;#39;t have access to them unless you have like an item or a key or something and it&amp;#39;s like well how do I unlock those just through side quests and stuff or like what czy me T your name was very uh interesting yesterday it did get a a big laugh out of me it did make me trule up there but yeah that&amp;#39;s the thing that like um I worry about playing with with like anything is like heat cuz that&amp;#39;s like what damages your PC like long term that&amp;#39;s what wears out your parts I can go this Emily person&amp;#39;s house now I&amp;#39;m somebody who has my PC on for very long periods of time like I always worry about that possibly do like those 14 hour streams and [ __ ] like that efficient is all mine isn&amp;#39;t really either mine isn&amp;#39;t either anything just stop I definitely feel that my case is really cool have the same thing it&amp;#39;s air flow is not GRE that&amp;#39;s is the cool thing about uh I&amp;#39;m sitting now as opposed to like back cuz I used to be that&amp;#39;s why my camera angles is cuz I used to sit on that wall behind me I&amp;#39;m trying to see if it&amp;#39;s closed or not it looks closed yeah is that like my PC is like you know by the window now so like if it&amp;#39;s cold out late at night like it is now I can just like keep my window open and help what do why do I just have a why is the roaming spor just chilling over here is she really just right here what is she doing name I have right now oh no where here she is hey sigor I&amp;#39;m glad you&amp;#39;re here my PO it&amp;#39;s

learned from the error of my ways I will I will I will make things better 100% I will make things better dropped almost dropped that got to wait for the spu cach to load back up whatever the [ __ ] that means ever jargon that was referring to that&amp;#39;s why she was getting yelling more that she was getting because that we were actually were on a timer there that we couldn&amp;#39;t see why she just kept getting more and more Angry once again very very unfortunate it&amp;#39;s interesting too I&amp;#39;m trying to think like we just kind of stumbled upon her on the side of the road so like will we be able to like find her in the exact same spot again because it was it was just kind of a random encounter you thank you hopefully we can hopefully we can that was [ __ ] speeding too like I was trying I was really trying to get there it was called pot lady was called pot lady one the side quest name or well I&amp;#39;ve been ignoring ignoring the uh there are race there are race side quests that I&amp;#39;ve intentionally been ignoring because well the driving in this game does does not handle well so forgive me if I&amp;#39;m not particularly enthused to do any sort of like races so this was kind of just a trying to help pot lady on accident Long all play yet I mean there&amp;#39;s only two songs in the entire game so yes let&amp;#39;s see cuz the way I found her she was on the side of the road on the way to a card in that farm well that I couldn&amp;#39;t even get to so right yeah cuz you&amp;#39;re trying to get this card but you can&amp;#39;t even get that card yeah that this is her right here so we just get on the main road and go left at the tunnel so we get on the main road yeah let me Road first second third or fourth left can you safe stay on this [Music] emulator I&amp;#39;ve not attempted but you don&amp;#39;t like seeing me replay sections of this game SM so where shall we go next what do you get burnout I&amp;#39;m good games the vibe it&amp;#39;s Cy first I&amp;#39;m glad that for like the um like the quote unquote like not race section but like the time sections it doesn&amp;#39;t like account for your gas and durability I would be shitty if it did second third our next left is one we need to take all right this would be way Cozier if the sound effect of the car wasn&amp;#39;t so obnoxious and we weren&amp;#39;t playing this like weird like PS2 era like simpsons&amp;#39;s ass music in the background it&amp;#39;s like they just didn&amp;#39;t want Dead Silence while you&amp;#39;re were driving so where shall we go next so they just put something random in the background I&amp;#39;m like I&amp;#39;m not sure about that did we just get air time somehow we&amp;#39;re going 45 you work for dbd you say that but somebody probably I ially wants that hard pushes for that yep here she is okay um let&amp;#39;s see what that would would be just taking your advice um how do I make a safe State there are safe States but how do I make one what is the button I&amp;#39;m not seeing shortcuts control s is safe State yeah control s is safe state so we will do that um it I don&amp;#39;t think we should have done that I I don&amp;#39;t think we should have done that cuz I just crashed the emulator I don&amp;#39;t I don&amp;#39;t I don&amp;#39;t think we should have done that that that crashed the game that that&amp;#39;s that um I don&amp;#39;t know about that I I think I think I think that broke it I think I well uh let&amp;#39;s try loading up the safe state that crashed the game so save states yes that&amp;#39;s what I pressed and it and it crashed the video game so uh yeah yeah I I pressed contrs and it crashed the game so uh oops well that uh that [ __ ] happened we will get pot lady home eventually eventually soon TM whenever the [ __ ] that actually please just let me back in so I can let pot lady home I think I&amp;#39;m over I think I&amp;#39;m over the side quest thing for a little bit I think I&amp;#39;m just going to play Main lot after we take pot lady home we had a little bit of of uh lot of lot of backtracking and stuff so think I&amp;#39;m good I&amp;#39;m just gonna I think I&amp;#39;m just going to you know play the video game oh hey hey at least it brought me right back here crashing oh oh never mind okay then I tried to move and it froze again this yeah it just crashed again okay I feel like we were trying to do save states to to to like you know save some headache and I feel like it&amp;#39;s creating more it&amp;#39;s creating more problems that it&amp;#39;s solving that is this is okay okay okay all right all right all right yeah this is uh intriguing to say the least it&amp;#39;s definitely doing a thing well while this let&amp;#39;s back up I&amp;#39;m using the restroom real quick and if this breaks again we&amp;#39;re just going to little back to normal save and drive all the way back e freeze again it freezed it froze again yeah I don&amp;#39;t know what&amp;#39;s wrong with the save states but they break the game",

does it always does that turn up a little bit just slightly this menu theme is very cozy too I didn&amp;#39;t play anything on this uh it literally zero time look I didn&amp;#39;t play anything on that I just started up to make sure it captured the audio and everything I didn&amp;#39;t play I promise I saw something felt something maybe was more real than reality I felt like I was lost walking through this dark tunnel and the ground beneath me stretched on for an eternity felt like I was dying he swerved out of his Lane striking a pass that started a pile up killing seven in wether whoever seven is I feel bad to see another band of thunderstorms heading toward the city tomorrow night that&amp;#39;s the studio I just had this insane sense of of um emptiness and Terror and I just I just I don&amp;#39;t care who she sees we&amp;#39;re not even married anymore she can see whoever she wants this is very a moody end soling the problem I ignored it tried to forget I watched television and that helped it dolls the pain oh interesting it&amp;#39;s taking over they&amp;#39;re very moody and and kind of like scary intro for a game about Sesame Street muppets watch the 1979 version of director cut uh I don&amp;#39;t really know the difference between the two to be honest with you I would probably be the good person to ask about that but um I think I&amp;#39;ve only ever only ever watched the I think I&amp;#39;ve only ever seen the director&amp;#39;s C okay last job of the day what&amp;#39;s this one about I know so sprocket pal property management work request client City

difficulties just like in Resident Evil games it&amp;#39;s great oh a candy bar I&amp;#39;m not eating that that&amp;#39;s been different days you haven&amp;#39;t thrown it out you animal the intro is a lot louder than the actual like game so wait we&amp;#39;re not going to who is that who&amp;#39;s your lady you&amp;#39;re going to sell us who your lady is who you&amp;#39;re admiring disabled the last job of the day is always the worst the S of scale here is actually pretty uh actually pretty good like does make me feel like that thing is huge and towering over me we go elsewhere card read so we&amp;#39;ll probably be able to come back to that at some point NOP patching no jumping so far for to stop reminds me of those old uh you know how uh you go to McDonald&amp;#39;s back in the day and then the Ronald McDonald&amp;#39;s statue you could sit with what that reminds me of oh so we got to come back to that too we&amp;#39;re obviously go in there but I kind of want to look around a little bit first Frozen 2 I&amp;#39;ve also never seen Frozen 2 only never seen the first one looks like we got a lot of stuff we will be visiting later once we have the correct uh items which is also very uh emblematic of Resident Evil there&amp;#39;s an elevator maybe it still works already in here [ __ ] Singularity come through here why is that gooped bring me okay how it&amp;#39;s getting stuck all the way up raise the curtain bring up the lights the neighborhood is coming to town uh hello I&amp;#39;m here to disconnect the antenna television&amp;#39;s heartbeat has returned a spirit of cheer brightens every child&amp;#39;s eye the cry goes round the kindergarten class the neighborhood the neighborhood okay I I&amp;#39;m here to disconnect the entire I am Ricky the sock your television will never be the same we hold on did you say disconnect the antenna yes oh my no no no no no no you mustn&amp;#39;t do that that would be a catastrophe it&amp;#39;s Broadcast News the news no no trust me the antenna is just fine as it is doesn&amp;#39;t need any disconnecting tell you what you wait here and I&amp;#39;ll and I&amp;#39;ll uh I&amp;#39;ll get I&amp;#39;ll get you some that was me earlier today I was pretty sick earlier today yeah that was literally me earlier today I was I was very sick that wasn&amp;#39;t I&amp;#39;m check I&amp;#39;m feel a little bit better now but that was I don&amp;#39;t know if I ate something yesterday was bad or what okay then it&amp;#39;s kind of interesting how like that was special I like how like um like it like did a really good job of like mimicking how like the like puppets actually act and stuff like that like that did really seriously remind me of oh it&amp;#39;s half of one of the things that we need for the Aviary outside we don&amp;#39;t have an inventory yet oh here we go you have to press tab CL car might open another part of the studio now if it&amp;#39;s like normal resid Evil games you got to examine stuff sometimes to see more about them so getting used to the control a bit here sorry tap in your step what that just means health or what oh so this is where I buy more of those if I need them we&amp;#39;re going to the character looks like something could be placed here oh Norman June Leonard Norman June and Leonard Liliana and George okay all the names of the people that will eventually be attacking us okay maybe now that we have that card we go back to that uh other door outside maybe cuz that one door is gooped purple gooped we&amp;#39;re not getting in there fortunately I wonder if this lets you do what you can do in AR games where like cuz we already have half of The Medallion for the um for the Aviary hey who&amp;#39;s that uh that&amp;#39;s not good can I put that in yes you can so now it&amp;#39;s out of our inventory was nice so we can save on inventory space was good what about saving works I I think there was a save system in the previous game but I should forget what it was my limited save system just like oh my God my arm was disembodied they got me already PL symbol y number 1968 television&amp;#39;s friendly new neighbor review of my friendly neighborhood week saw the

sometimes I get some lines to recite too let me show you whoa you enjoy your anim I a CRA the heck is going on here you give me a Tas and I&amp;#39;ll give you a I like to start with Pipers to give something to shapes out of I&amp;#39;ll make triangles and SES and cires ands why is he doing that the the puppets are evil little piles based on color this will be what you make your crafts out of I like to use Norman because he has all sorts of oranges and reds I can use now I startat PES of to the bers look see I made of All Eyes what do you think letter love oh sure being a LP is great yeah the the puppets are not supposed to be able to move on their own but they are Pirates Cove yeah that&amp;#39;s a reference to actual Muppets what is this what are these things SC Main Street neighborh is having an outdoor bizaar everyone&amp;#39;s lining up at Leonard&amp;#39;s antique display to try and on cry on and put of earrings Pearl enters SE earrings Cuts in the line pushing land way causing a commotion Pearl that wasn&amp;#39;t very nice Pearl sheepishly glances around the others who we are who are all glow glowering at each other and she hunches in shame Steve you can&amp;#39;t just push people out of the way to get what you want Pearl it&amp;#39;s more friendly to think about what other people are think about other people first do you see shakes her head timidly well maybe this will make it clear but other people before yourself okay yeah I kind of a mixture of FNAF Resident Evil and beses Street which is kind of that&amp;#39;s a combo oh duct tape in the toilet that&amp;#39;s where I put it don&amp;#39;t think I went particularly the right way but we will see right music music I don&amp;#39;t have a way to deal with them yet so I should just avoid them for now music before you never heard that was the funny thing about listening to them was uh or about the that&amp;#39;s locked okay that was the funny thing about um demo was just listening to them blabber on by themselves seem like a shooting range but like wait oh okay so now I have a way to I have a a weapon I can deal with things now let&amp;#39;s say without a way to deal with them uh I was not going to uh beating them up but now we have access areas we would myself this is the part that is no what huh I love wait oh this is this [Music] is oh this is they don&amp;#39;t really like attack you they kind of just like yeah they don&amp;#39;t really attack you they just kind of just like force grab you and when they grab you with the force they throw you back huh I like that cuz he&amp;#39;s just a puppet I guess when that energy that&amp;#39;s taking them over is gone they just kind of like become nothing okay copy R for is uh inventory system did hey fire hopefully your vacation is going well okay now we have a map this is where I am okay we got some tokens this is our save system C up at 11:00 a.m. voluntarily let&amp;#39;s go actual normal sleeping schedule for Once that&amp;#39;s wild oh this is this other door so I&amp;#39;m wondering like hey hey hey hey I wonder what happens when I scream yeah I&amp;#39;m I&amp;#39;m not going to fight them cuz they have like force hands like they can like throw you from further away than you can actually like interact with them at least from a melee perspective so I&amp;#39;m going to be a little bit more careful about that there you are now don&amp;#39;t toddle off again I&amp;#39;ve got some snackaroo waiting back in the lobby hey what&amp;#39;s going on here your puppet friends are attacking me oh are they how embarrassing by the way embarassing what&amp;#39;s your name what your name your moniker your handle your your handle how very modern Gordon Gordon your handle what a beautiful name I could say it all day Gordon Gordon Gordon is this a gun does it work oh my that&amp;#39;s where I I like how my arms disembodied I looking for it all over hey give that back I need fine if you&amp;#39;re going to go gallivanting all over the place least watch out for Pearl Pearl you know the enormous bird that crushes people don&amp;#39;t get on her bad side is all I what was that okay let&amp;#39;s do this oh there there&amp;#39;s no there&amp;#39;s no pause while you&amp;#39;re reading things wonder what happens when I scream let&amp;#39;s be excellent problem is I have no tape yeah problem is I have no tape so I can&amp;#39;t necessarily uh doog grapher okay the problem is I do not have any tape so if you&amp;#39;re familiar with the res Evil 1 make which is my favorite game of all time so you should be familiar with it um there&amp;#39;s a mechanic that um when you kill the Zombies in that game uh you have to uh burn them or else they come back even stronger later uh in this game my friendly neighborhood uh you use tape to put them down or else they just come right back so I don&amp;#39;t have any tape whereas in re1 it was the like the fuel to burn them game is f my friendly neighborhood which is a uh locked maybe I could find the key what&amp;#39;s this shape all about maybe she has it in here like where it&amp;#39;s res evil but with uh got there no res what&amp;#39;s that shut up leaders to give myself something to make shapes out of I&amp;#39;ll make triangles and squares and circles and Patch them all together wait I can hit her from there whoa we just found an exploit woo that was not on purpose I was just trying to break this open for the ammo let&amp;#39;s go yeah apparently we could have whacked her through there good to know good to know so I can kind of use that in the future sound like me I think she sounds like you all the time he he har got you I guess I don&amp;#39;t know something yeah see how he&amp;#39;s down there like he&amp;#39;s not dead but he&amp;#39;s just he&amp;#39;s just chilling intering that we can pay for a heal I do like that I&amp;#39;m going to try to conserve that as much as I can for now but I don&amp;#39;t know it kind of seems like a waste to use the ammo JP JP your I&amp;#39;m going to I&amp;#39;m going to try and figure out something so this is you saw our arms going through the door soever are you aspired it is so like what I&amp;#39;m fing right now so we can worry is do they go back to a tether location or do they okay so they go back to a tether location if you go through a door there is a reticle in the options I believe yeah there we go only took two I just don&amp;#39;t have any tape to keep her down unfortunately oh that&amp;#39;s just where this door goes hey try how&amp;#39;s it going why does she sound like that now why was she like all like okay if you can draw you can do all sorts of things grab your pencil and let&amp;#39;s go on an adventure the male the mail comes everywhere [Music] what do you do music you voes characters no locked but I don&amp;#39;t have the key oh here we have this now there we go so now we have this key cuz I needed to get that to shoot that to have access to this okay blue circle key okay so now we can do open blue circle doors to shoot that just so mean Spirit just to smack him for no reason that&amp;#39;s green triangle get her out of the way and looks like Playdoh you can&amp;#39;t just say that about some people that&amp;#39;s just rude that hurts their personal feelings go go go oh I wish these were real or if they are real I&amp;#39;m Hy because I was sick earlier I didn&amp;#39;t eat too much kind of Hy I might shot okay not really anything to deal with that necessarily this game seems like I I don&amp;#39;t know it&amp;#39;s just like it&amp;#39;s so fun at the same time you know like theoretically we&amp;#39;re in a pretty niy situation but like it&amp;#39;s just funny you know got a l of Personality cheat a [Music] cheetah I like to start with pipe cleers to give myself something to make shapes out of I&amp;#39;ll make triangles Andes and circles thank for God okay poopy how&amp;#39;s it going I just called you poopy and say CL and separate all of theirs into little piles nice first chat hello I just called you poopy your out of I like to use because he ofes and I can use now I start catching my wait is that something I can activate or is that like just something for like another playthrough it looks like something for another playthrough I guess should probably get back downstairs to her her neck of the woods got Dodge this lady out here really is like Resident Evil I&amp;#39;m like zombies do I Dodge in that sort of thing her we never ever have to tape cuz she is Lally over there on her own in the corner she&amp;#39;s like not bothering anybody and we could just safely put her down through the the the shelfing [Music] there can&amp;#39;t hear anything I don&amp;#39;t mind that okay so this is this we&amp;#39;re got to get back upstairs I think shut up I learn why every time why not you would smack him on the way through I think I have to slide by you okay so her she has switched positions she&amp;#39;s like yeah she&amp;#39;s hi June buug I was asked to talk about welcome welcome welcome noome excellent let&amp;#39;s not be excellent excent no no let&amp;#39;s not be excellent she

don&amp;#39;t necessarily want to tape him because he&amp;#39;s very Juke you typically want to take people that you can&amp;#39;t avoid like you have to have to encounter them to get through a hallway like you have to take damage to get around them hey hey hey hey see like him we can just go around and use that cart to just Loop by him so we don&amp;#39;t necessarily need to uh we

taking damage on the way to a health item to get the health item you know kind of silly so 26 is Max okay so that was just optional the fish one is in here got switch that to fish and come over here

we go now I got to do the onion one theab what the alphabet I don&amp;#39;t like that bird oh [ __ ] the bird triying to get me that was terrifying I was I was just talking about I didn&amp;#39;t like

there&amp;#39;s a fish one right here there was more than one fish one yeah yeah we we got that fish one we didn&amp;#39;t get the other one I wonder what that other one is let&amp;#39;s go check that out real quick before we get the onion thing yeah cuz there&amp;#39;s two fish ones maybe I shouldn&amp;#39;t talk this is like very chaotic I love it but it&amp;#39;s very C like like this is the probably there&amp;#39;s a lot of voices just going over at the same time oh so is it an extra option cuz that&amp;#39;s just empty now yeah that one&amp;#39;s empty and the other one&amp;#39;s empty is it just like that they give you multiple options to get the same thing Hi how are you of yeah you go back there yeah you you you go under there you go under there let&amp;#39;s go on an adventure I will say I am very very happy andly surprised this game went the route of uh maintaining I feel like I AG her yep she doesn&amp;#39;t have eyes didn&amp;#39;t look like it I am I am in the of it yeah anyways what I was saying is like usually when it comes to like Children&amp;#39;s Entertainment gone wrong horror games they&amp;#39;re very much just trying to monetize it as much as possible and aim it through to a kid&amp;#39;s audience but they didn&amp;#39;t do that with us oh this is just ammo I feel like the last block is probably back here do I have the last block sponges yeah so I got a I&amp;#39;m pretty sure it&amp;#39;s back here it&amp;#39;s the only in the my neighbor into and Sh to my house in the mail the stock pile of greasy I I I don&amp;#39;t like how yeah the blocks right there I don&amp;#39;t like how like they kind of like force grab you and in general I kind of don&amp;#39;t like how like I kind of in general don&amp;#39;t like how like the melee in this game functions especially that&amp;#39;s the only way the enemies are going to be fighting you is that they kind of just like exist at arms length and at any point they can just like force push to you you know that&amp;#39;s a little awkward I got to go there birdie what are you doing neighbor this here hope don&amp;#39;t mind thank you all right anyways bye the bird the glasses I feel like she why is

outside oh we&amp;#39;re already done with this section I feel like that went by rather quickly I feel like that went by rather quickly this I didn&amp;#39;t fully explore in here what did I not get know there&amp;#39;s this door maybe that&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s doing it that yeah cuz that&amp;#39;s a separate room it&amp;#39;s saying it didn&amp;#39;t fully explore this little area back here

best sort of monster janitor thing but he&amp;#39;s a little obsessed with the organic maintenance tends to pop out of pipes and clobber people with his wrench great are all of you puppets crazy well Ray has always been a little grouchy even before the shutdown that&amp;#39;s why they moved him down down here only way out is by elevator and he can&amp;#39;t figure out how to use the buttons got it oh silly me I forgot about the elevators really Gordon I wouldn&amp;#39;t bother the cables are probably rusted I don&amp;#39;t think they even run anymore I&amp;#39;ll take my chances wow

diary 1974 April 16th I was hanging around the office last night to keep the pipes from freezing so I had time to work out all the Kinks of my lasest project the output is pretty flashy but use up a lot of ammo yeah so where that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s the note in reference to the shotgun is it just in one of these oh here it is it&amp;#39;s on the wall the novelist no room huh does check mark mean it&amp;#39;s used up oh no there&amp;#39;s a shotgun yes yes there is I&amp;#39;m going to assume so because that&amp;#39;s what it means in resent Evil games so I can free up some space there my

started oh um jeez that gave me a scare what was that yeah I ended up a situation when the pandemic started and I like a lot of people uh got laid off at the beginning of the pandemic um so I needed something that I could do uh at home uh and I started streaming because that was something that like I had run a lot of streams before for other people but I never done it for myself so boy do I have just for you I needed this shoot yeah I ran a lot of streams for other people but not for myself so I decided to put those skills that I had to use hold on they&amp;#39;re coming brothery what&amp;#39;s up I [Laughter] wor yeah that&amp;#39;s kind of how I started streaming is I just kind of need something that I could do from home because it was the pandemic so nobody could really go outside and everybody was hold everybody who had a job was holding on to their jobs so I couldn&amp;#39;t get back into the field of work that I was in um so yeah streaming your past students man to see your streams now not that I&amp;#39;m aware of not that I&amp;#39;m aware of no and I prefer to keep it that way for the most part hey Nova been a while butd hopefully you&amp;#39;ve been well

going to go outside to look at H different it&amp;#39;s true it&amp;#39;s true Hi man side to pre-order Starfield tell me how it is whenever comes out of course cuz I am hesitant to buy another Bethesda game after the uh After Fall 76 looks like they&amp;#39;re talking to each other dude he hits from so far away hello he hits from so far away holy [ __ ] droing the PS5 yeah they&amp;#39;re redoing that I did see that I&amp;#39;m not a huge Metal Gear fan though okay so now this has power oh hold on I don&amp;#39;t quite remember how this puzzle Works to be honest not being sh your thanks be love [Music] Venom I think this is one of those puzzles where like it&amp;#39;s a little difficult cuz I don&amp;#39;t know what it wants square is square + 2 and what is this thing okay so I can press square that doesn&amp;#39;t do anything so I need to get like a combination oh you put it in there okay hold on yeah CU there was a slot right there oh it moves it oh okay it moves it okay okay okay so what time do we want it to be so you that to be on seven 6 + 2 one so circle triangle square okay that one&amp;#39;s right see one two so circle square square bad happened what what happened a what&amp;#39;s up though I do appreciate Starfield so much better than 26 yeah but they&amp;#39;re going to be making on the same engine miles that&amp;#39;s why they&amp;#39;re saying that they&amp;#39;re still not updating their engine so it is going to have all the same bugs and issues okay and three square square triangle he wow wonder how deep this goes make the game entertaining I think it&amp;#39;s just I&amp;#39;m going to be real it&amp;#39;s because we&amp;#39;ve made a m out as The Gaming Community if any other game company did that it would be like it would be the laughing stock I think we just let be bethesa have a pass cuz it made a lot of our like childhood games my R2 game and realized I my got crossed over to my PS4 oh that&amp;#39;s not good let me you e it&amp;#39;s what words are made out of then we started laughing at each other and everything okay that&amp;#39;s why you should always to this is the elevator that we&amp;#39;re talking about out of order that goes nowhere oh boat me see make sure there&amp;#39;s nothing over here before I take this we&amp;#39;re driving the boat he station now where is a yeah I still can&amp;#39;t believe people hate on R for make as much as they do I think it&amp;#39;s an excellent game yep like I said this is the other side of this I was like I think that goes to where the boat is that was right I remember that from a year ago the demo a year ago yeah but I think the question for me is like why why do we let him get away with that that was bad that was needless waste of ammo I just got stuck in a corner there so I forgot my orientation of where I come out of that room and where I need to be so now we have a shortcut can I thank you like if I cannot deal with you that would&amp;#39; be wonderful Ray you&amp;#39;re stinky and I don&amp;#39;t like you nostalgic in away yeah and they&amp;#39;re lucky they&amp;#39;re lucky that they have that all sorts of things let&amp;#39;s go maybe I&amp;#39;m just going to tape you so I can cross through this hallway whenever I want they&amp;#39;re talking to each other yeah they&amp;#39;re friends it&amp;#39;s cute oh not this room not that room wrong

close there&amp;#39;s like kind of like a not that a game like this necessarily needs like a like a plot but it&amp;#39;s mostly just gameplay there&amp;#39;s not really a whole lot of like not really a whole lot of uh electric latch huh oh my that strange kind of breaker box rats are they puppets too that&amp;#39;s what I&amp;#39;m wondering are they all or are they actually just like normal rats that are just styed keeps taking the breakers someone Asis keeps taking the breakers that you use to open these do so I put them in lock boxes around the basement oh I got to go find this I think it&amp;#39;s Ray okay so that&amp;#39;s where all the stuff is there&amp;#39;s one back this way no this is a different thing yeah oh this is another save room like how it makes you HT for this stuff

the room by the um the actual uh save room like not the there&amp;#39;s two down here but the first one by the a clock in puzzle so we got to Route our way back to that I do believe just keep an eye out for there&amp;#39;s one in here too so we know where the last two are no no no no I&amp;#39;m thinking of somewhere else there&amp;#39;s not one in here where you know what I&amp;#39;m talking about I&amp;#39;m talking about that the locker one is that all the way that&amp;#39;s in a different area is it yeah that&amp;#39;s all I know where that is yeah I&amp;#39;m talking about the locker room one the locker room has one of those that&amp;#39;s really far away very very far away this is how you exit this zone right this isn&amp;#39;t how you get it deeper in yeah okay so I have to go

happening there&amp;#39;s one in the save room itself over here I do believe and that&amp;#39;s our last one yep Club is last uh we&amp;#39;ll save to the next save room it&amp;#39;s right next to it we&amp;#39;ve done all that seeing caves like this reminds me of the forest man SS of the forest was such a bust that was not a great sequel it was expensive too like I feel like I just like I feel like I did not get the bank from my buck for that one at all do up well the stairs tried to eat me there I think it&amp;#39;s the other door if I&amp;#39;m correct I hate you welcome a c d e f g I love to sing I will say that I think this game has a lot of charm I do wish it was a little bit more creepy though like they&amp;#39;re a little too zany not that that&amp;#39;s a bad thing but like you know what I&amp;#39;m saying like I&amp;#39;m not even I&amp;#39;m not really actually afraid of them at all you know like at all hey thank you now I can open the another boat yo astal thank you much for L friend I very much appreciate that hopefully your night&amp;#39;s going well a l a boat travel down here all this just for a uh that&amp;#39;s me Street Studio yeah that&amp;#39;s the story okay now I have the stuff that will help me get into this side area destroyed her she look did me wrong what are you doing down here new enemies are respawning which is not good for us not good for us I always start by getting ready for B I&amp;#39;m [Laughter] four three four five seven you did it I like how he paused to think about it too like he was like 1 two 3 4 5 seven it took him a second he was still wrong oh no oh wow that&amp;#39;s pretty great it&amp;#39;s starting again oh what in the Resident Evil 8 is [Music] happening it even has like the the Spencer Mansion overhang yeah even the okay so we just came out of the basement where the sorry I will sorry crowded in there I&amp;#39;ll keep exploring the main wall what are these giant golden statues oh we&amp;#39;re in the studio locked of course it is yeah this is the the other side of that very good graphics does they&amp;#39;re also stylized so it&amp;#39;s kind of hard to tell if anything was bad that just cheeseburger on the ground I&amp;#39;m going to take a look around the uh you know that looks really important for not being able to interact with it okay that&amp;#39;s it in terms of the stuff can I go through here oh uh goodbye wrong room wrong room uh I have to use the potty really badly and when you got to go you got to go so I&amp;#39;m going to go use restroom real quick and when we get back we will continue with this uh it&amp;#39;s pretty interesting I like I said I wish there was a little bit more in the sense of like like I love how zy and cool the game is I do wish there&amp;#39;s a little bit little bit more of a edge to it it seems a little like it&amp;#39;s funny campy but it&amp;#39;s like there&amp;#39;s no like horror to like kind of balance it out so it&amp;#39;s just like a little too campy but that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s a very minor complaint yeah I&amp;#39;m going to use the restroom I&amp;#39;ll be back CH down the stream enjoy your chair time I&amp;#39;ll be back as soon as possible e e back yeah the fact that I wasn&amp;#39;t expecting it to just like kind of like be not spooky at all that&amp;#39;s kind of what uh kind of what&amp;#39;s catching on me off guard it&amp;#39;s kind of like the only thing I could pick apart right now because obviously I feel ride at home with the resent evil stuff you know this res evil is my favorite gaming franchise um so it&amp;#39;s just more of that like I&amp;#39;m just kind of like going through the motions right cuz like it&amp;#39;s like formatted like my favorite game franchise um but I wish it did have a little bit more of a horror Edge to it cuz right now it&amp;#39;s just all [Music] Camp oh okay there&amp;#39;s new enemy type those guys these guys suck they take so this is like something from a horror movie the sort of thing that moves as soon as you turn your back yeah does it though foreshadowing I hope not oh it&amp;#39;s another sa room I like the very res evil es res evil 7es save room music I can probably bring this back now those I can just stash these right now I think the check mark means it is used like it&amp;#39;s used up but uh uh wait box full my box is not full oh it&amp;#39;s just poorly organized sorry iot take I actually kind of liked the auto feat the auto feature in uh uh Resident Evil 4 a lot of people were like oh it&amp;#39;s lazy it does it for you now and I&amp;#39;m like no this is great cuz as as fun as this can be uh like reorganizing your stuff like also be very annoying what do you mean box there is enough room for that I I&amp;#39;m just going to go and take one of these cuz I am injured anyway there we go there we go easy peasy teth it can be fun oh we can wear the mask and pretend to be them oh oh I think I just did all that I need four squares together play I feel like everybody feels that way but like it can be fun but like for the most part I I&amp;#39;d rather just do the auto sorder from remake yeah I&amp;#39;m going to stash this I&amp;#39;m just going to stash that the shotgun just takes up so much room for not really using it too often that&amp;#39;s the problem that&amp;#39;s what I hate about it like I want to use the shotgun CU it&amp;#39;s a fun weapon but like it&amp;#39;s just too [ __ ] just takes up too much [ __ ] space there we go hey do I wear this no I just need it for something using a play or a horror movie I think I can tell you which one I know why I&amp;#39;m made Ty difficult for that by the way I&amp;#39;m not saying that I&amp;#39;m right I know I have the uh the opposing opinion for not being like for liking an order Auto sort option like sometimes I like getting into it but a lot of time I also just would rather just press a button and call today yeah you have to takee them every [Music] time I should probably tape that one in particular cuz if that&amp;#39;s going to be my save room that I use the entire game that&amp;#39;s always going to be in the way cu the game way too quickly I need to play it again too I already played it a couple times but like I still love that game that&amp;#39;s my third favorite Resident Evil game 1979 on the war reflection last month marked 7 years since the end of the war there was a war in 1979 in this universe say a good time to reflect the impact it&amp;#39;s had on our lives I think wait yeah wait what I think across all City the war left is feeling troubled are you referring to the like old war we were called for service of the lake of righteousness love for one city no no no this is like seems like an actual Hot War like actual action others but in the end we found that those calls were just Noble lies and behind the horor reality thwarted our story ideals we left home as Heroes and came home murderers okay maybe it is talking about the Cold War and just talking about the multiple military actions that we have okay sorry I&amp;#39;m a I&amp;#39;m a former Social scies teacher you don&amp;#39;t know that background so my brain&amp;#39;s like we haven&amp;#39;t had an official War at that time per but we had tons of military actions we&amp;#39;ve had tons of military actions even technically the war on terror which like our most recent one is not technically a declared war it was just a bunch of military actions so [ __ ] with my brain using that logic I guess or using that verbage but this tension leads to the question why should we care about right and wrong or friendliness as the children&amp;#39;s Show puts it following such things could have a terrible cost the only reason would be if there was some overarching purpose some gu goodness and to our wanderings in the world that is exactly what an injustice like the war calls into question perhaps it&amp;#39;s time to look put aside these old ideas for it&amp;#39;s time to look for other sorts so perhaps the wise man is the one who lives for himself really deep for this game CER yeah but that&amp;#39;s not a real war that&amp;#39;s not a real war of death like we didn&amp;#39;t actually go to war with Russia in any formal capacity like like Congress did not declare war that was not a thing it&amp;#39;s just referred to as the Cold War uh because like there were so many military actions on both sides of people trying to get like one UPS on each other between uh capitalism and communism democracy and communist state but like there was no official declaration of war now so there&amp;#39;s no Tech technically no War I hate that the punctuation is a grenade it is it&amp;#39;s a grenade okay interesting faing contest between both Nations yeah so there&amp;#39;s a nuclear arms race going on in the background which is the scariest thing and the most important thing that happens but there was also a lot of like skirmishes um as as they referred to as military actions in many different countries technically yeah like there&amp;#39;s a lot of like um yeah there&amp;#39;s a lot of military actions quote unquote where we invaded a country in the name of democracy or some [ __ ] sometimes it was actually for democracy sometimes it was for resources and we just said it was for the good of their people or whatever why are we colleting these masks I&amp;#39;m I&amp;#39;m going to be real I&amp;#39;m just put the shotgun away I&amp;#39;m just going to get rid of the shotgun I want to use it but like it&amp;#39;s it just takes up so much [ __ ] inventory space that it&amp;#39;s literally not worth hauling it and all it shells around it&amp;#39;s really not didn&amp;#39;t do much about them I do learn a well there&amp;#39;s also the fact that you know this is going to be boring for everybody else I guess like that&amp;#39;s uh theoretically that is like in terms of modern world history that&amp;#39;s one of the last things you really learn about I want this route to my uh save room clear yeah um it&amp;#39;s one of the last things you learn about in terms of the at least in the state that I live it&amp;#39;s one of the last things you you uh cover in the school year so if you&amp;#39;re if a teacher is behind for any reason they do like they will probably like shorten that unit they can&amp;#39;t skip it because it&amp;#39;s on the state test but like they may uh go light on it so to speak and also the cold war is kind of hard in an abstract concept to teach because it&amp;#39;s not theoretically actually a war you know it is just a bunch of uh essentially strings being pulled in the background people trying to get the one up one up on each other between communism and democracy American Revolution Independence it just kind of goes to show you that like like I I get why in that in a World&amp;#39;s in a in a world scale the revolution is very very important because like it did set the standard of like hey if a if a country does treat its people poorly you can just [ __ ] leave going Ambush me huh almost did that perfectly almost did that perfectly it was for war yeah literally it stemm the War stemmed sorry I&amp;#39;m not going to get into a whole history lesson I&amp;#39;ll try to be brief don&amp;#39;t get me going um stem from the fact that you know we certain powers after World War II were like hey collectively we say that you know [ __ ] Germany [ __ ] Italy [ __ ] all those guys that you know tried to run dictatorships as a form of government those guys are bad and then we all sat together afterwards as a bunch of countries and said okay now that the dictat ship is gone now we do 1 2 3 democracy communism okay let&amp;#39;s try it again 1 2 three democracy communism it seems we were in an impass and then they started like not in a formal War but you know and many military actions and covert actions started essentially fighting to install whatever government form they had preferred in what was it in the Fallout of World War II so that&amp;#39;s why it took so long just like it was essentially like the major world powers fting to like reformat countries after like in the wake of such an incredibly long long drawn out and bloody Affair oh cck the wrong button oh it&amp;#39;s a little Norman mug so it just it was an extremely long run out of there for that reason lock from the other side and that&amp;#39;s why like a lot of people like who are older than us like past Generations before us are so patriotic like so aggressively patriotic and don&amp;#39;t question anything because it wasn&amp;#39;t just being patriotic yeah it wasn&amp;#39;t just being patriotic it was like you had you were patriotic but you were also against communism at the same time oh oh [Music] oh the male the male comes every day I look out the window waiting for the moment it appears got very close definitely going to tape the big guy we got the map now got shotgun shells for the shotgun that we don&amp;#39;t have on us okay yo Jazz homie happy belated birthday la la la la la Elmo&amp;#39;s World holy [ __ ] 2 years yeah whopping Years love you all you we love you too we love you too homie thank you for the whopping two years that&amp;#39;s crazy I&amp;#39;ve only been streaming for three years starting Friday

far it&amp;#39;s very like atmospheric in like a good way all the doors are locked though I do like that you don&amp;#39;t have to nearly avoid as many people if you&amp;#39;re good with the rench [Music] dude I literally was [ __ ] I was non-stop firing I was going as fast as I could miss Indy night oh I didn&amp;#39;t even end up doing it I ended up just playing more DVD cuz I was just feeling it so you didn&amp;#39;t miss nothing so all the games I was going to play all the games I was going to play Wednesday I&amp;#39;m going to be uh playing next Wednesday instead any cabinets or anything search no guys are annoying cuz you they you have to expend ammo like there&amp;#39;s no other way past them I said that with 9 9 shots oh shooting section okay got you really is Resident Evil huh full note table guys could somebody play that my friend the neighborhood game with Norman in the rec room he&amp;#39;s been waiting around for days again and it&amp;#39;s just starting to affect my target times I he&amp;#39;s staring at the back of my head Barry Barry I can&amp;#39;t find the second player&amp;#39;s token and Norman won&amp;#39;t let me play with anything else did someone pick it up as part of another game CLA I&amp;#39;m sorry CLA grab this part of the chest set don&amp;#39;t worry I stopped by this afternoon played a couple rounds with him never i s of Home ruin my run I&amp;#39;m sorry ha that sucks that does suck a lot okay [ __ ] why is that one the reticle is not very accurate I&amp;#39;m noticing cuz you notice I&amp;#39;m shooting straight at things and it&amp;#39;s not always [Music] working yeah see like why why is like that why that take so long to why that take so long to work looks like fun maybe I&amp;#39;ll give it a shot oh he has a key but it&amp;#39;s missing a piece been the hands of neighbors include their combination it seems like inside the facility like they were always alive like they were always alive like the puppets were always alive saw the heat vulnerable items out of the hands of neighbors I want include the combination here in case you can some of them can&amp;#39;t read or some of them can read let&amp;#39;s just say it&amp;#39;ll help you see the flip side of things yeah it seems to them like the the puppets were always alive the flip side of things okay hold on me use a good old Power photoshop on my disposal here okay something&amp;#39;s missing how do I yeah I guess I can&amp;#39;t solve this yet if it says something&amp;#39;s missing but might give a good idea of the combination I will say I enjoy this a lot I do enjoy this a lot a lot where&amp;#39;s this where am I now west office how many coins do I have [Music] or just two stacks of [Music] four I don&amp;#39;t know if it&amp;#39;s a good time to save or not look it I remember ending Resident Evil 1 the first time I played it with like [ __ ] 32 [ __ ] 32 the increments oh you&amp;#39;re just in here now are [Music] you he&amp;#39;s a big boy precious big boy I&amp;#39;ve learn that&amp;#39;s a local franchise by the way I&amp;#39;ve made that joke on stream for so long and I realized that like most people don&amp;#39;t even have a fous also known as Big Boy I know in some other places it&amp;#39;s known as Big Boy simply and not brous did I ever press this not working okay I don&amp;#39;t think I did when it came in here earlier yeah mely that&amp;#39;s not a thing I like okay I had no idea that was local that&amp;#39;s just always a joke I made essentially like because [Music] it&amp;#39;s yeah like why is the uh reticle off sometimes like I was shooting dead at that thing and it just like it took me three shots to actually hit you can&amp;#39;t even say it&amp;#39;s like recoil because like it was the first shot that&amp;#39;s clearly not what&amp;#39;s happening I don&amp;#39;t know what these masks are for yeah I have eight so I can I can definitely afford to save in not worry ERS I might all right kill that&amp;#39;s what I did what I would do is uh if they&amp;#39;re on CLA and you use the uh the flame rounds okay so what you do to deal with liquor super easy on CLA is you use the flame rounds and you approach from behind because what happens in Resident Evil 2 unless they patch it out since the time I&amp;#39;ve played it is that um if you approach a lier from behind and you hit it with a flame round um it&amp;#39;s going to uh start burning and it has an animation specifically for when it catches on fire and it has to go through that entire animation but by the time the animation ends the fire still below it and it has to turn around to face you and then it gets caught in the fire animation again before it can turn around and it just [ __ ] dies so yeah they face of your inventory no I I found them I found these masks and I don&amp;#39;t I have no idea what they&amp;#39;re for yet yeah I do not know what they&amp;#39;re for yet avoid them yeah I I just when I played CLA I would just I would just uh blast him where do I want to be [Music] [Music] [Music] even [Music] you I thought it was just funny they were blocking that whole hallway very aggressively yeah I didn&amp;#39;t go down here yeah I don&amp;#39;t get the [ __ ] [Music] I don&amp;#39;t get why the uh the retical is just incorrect for the most part I to respons I used to be all turned upside down in my thinking about responsibility I remember one day upstairs made breakfast for my parents went to school rode home on the bus did my homework and went to bed early I used to be resp I learned my numbers when I was a kid lunch is my favorite meal of the day I always eat the food that most represents how I&amp;#39;m feeling at lunch oh it&amp;#39;s the piece for his his game well I&amp;#39;m glad you asked in the room when I&amp;#39;m confused I eat the RO outside when I&amp;#39;m angry I Feast upon the tears of my enemies I Feast upon the tears of my enemies wonder how many lines they have if you can draw you can do all sorts of things grab your pencil and let&amp;#39;s go on an adventure welc I&amp;#39;m going to tape him cuz we&amp;#39;re going to be coming back through this uh hallway a lot cuz that&amp;#39;s a oneway shot so I got to get back to the recck room not this way I don&amp;#39;t like going through this [ __ ] hallway with the kitchen there&amp;#39;s just too much [ __ ] there yeah I&amp;#39;d rather just go into the main hall and go through the go through the uh office cuz that that is just too much of a am intensive responsibility see I used to be all turned upside down in my thinking about responsibility I remember one day I came downstairs made breakfast for my parents getting low on tape yeah technically you don&amp;#39;t need the uh flame rounds technically for the for the uh Ivy stuff if you&amp;#39;re good enough but I understand that especially like that&amp;#39;s especially easier just to blow them up not mention this says it&amp;#39;s not fully explored so I don&amp;#39;t know if there&amp;#39;s something we can&amp;#39;t open here or like did I miss something I&amp;#39;m not going at least you&amp;#39;re honest not good enough yet key word not good enough yet oh there we go say did I not look at all these there we go no there&amp;#39;s still more stuff that I did not find oh here we go there we go now it&amp;#39;s cleared I can explore this now that he&amp;#39;s in out in the hallway cuz that&amp;#39;s what kept me from exploring this room earlier or it was the fact that that dude was in here the [ __ ] shotgun ammo takes up so much [ __ ] space and I don&amp;#39;t even have it on me I I think I&amp;#39;ll thank myself I&amp;#39;ll like be thanking myself later for having all of it but like the shotgun itself takes up way too much space the shotgun ammo also takes up way too much space here&amp;#39;s your piece um okay the they they they are they are spup that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s a name I what I&amp;#39;m just going to call you pup okay I&amp;#39;m just going to call you pup thank you for the follow friend I appreciate you friend hopefully you&amp;#39;re well thank you for the follow I was afraid I was going to say something Mona then I realiz I&amp;#39;m like no it&amp;#39;s just I I just don&amp;#39;t understand what actually is [Music] happening um where do I need to be see man Norman draw a card I want to draw a card what look at him one two three four [Music] five June bug is [Music] okay let&amp;#39;s do J let&amp;#39;s have fun okay one two hey you can&amp;#39;t do what huh guess I got to follow the rules wait what did I do play the top card of your deck oh I had to reach for something else [ __ ] man I just took all that health for no reason okay well that&amp;#39;s [ __ ] lame can&amp;#39;t forget this time yeah I&amp;#39;m just going to avoid Leonard one one two three I win well I&amp;#39;ll use this since I [ __ ] got wallets by him okay I don&amp;#39;t like how we have these giant masks in our inventory that are doing quite literally nothing okay we can go up and out we can go out access that in the executive hallway there are people in the lobby now there were not puppets in the lobby initially now there are when that happened wonder when they spawned in where did you all show up if you canop you can do question I how another one of these [ __ ] masks what do I need these for that it&amp;#39;s [ __ ] what do I need these for cuz these are very inventory intensive so I&amp;#39;m just carrying them around any how&amp;#39;s it going uh this game&amp;#39;s pretty interesting it&amp;#39;s like Resident Evil except in a sesame in like a cursed Sesame Street like um Studio it&amp;#39;s very it&amp;#39;s very interesting obviously res evil is my favorite uh video game franchise so it makes my brain go bur it is a little interesting though sound like he&amp;#39;s right behind me but he wasn&amp;#39;t is how&amp;#39;s it going how are you homie how is your Satur treating you I got to go downstairs I went the wrong way great that&amp;#39;s good to hear I am glad sounds fun dude some of the the [ __ ] these guys say are so [ __ ] zany and wild just listening to The puppet&amp;#39;s Talk sign what do you do when you get upset better it get you down let me tell you about the time that my yeah it&amp;#39;s good I used all the tape in here that way I can actually like come to this place safely I&amp;#39;m going to stash one of these are there going to be four masks in that case I&amp;#39;ll St I&amp;#39;m going to stash two of these away yeah that&amp;#39;s why I have room for those you have some friends I&amp;#39;m sorry friend if it makes me feel better I was sick most of the to I&amp;#39;m not like sick right now but I&amp;#39;m like tired from being sick if that makes sense that&amp;#39;s how I was most of the day I was just down for the count wonder of the doors over here out triang what did y&amp;#39;all get down here oh we&amp;#39;re on the other side of the studio GES always help yeah I&amp;#39;m just like I said I&amp;#39;m just I&amp;#39;m mostly just tired from being sick I&amp;#39;m not actually sick anymore I think just ate something bad yesterday and it was putting me down these are the Hydraulics for the elevator where&amp;#39;s the fluid tank so now I&amp;#39;m just tired from being sick I hav had candy bar in forever yeah it seems like there&amp;#39;s like Phantom shots and I don&amp;#39;t know why or like there&amp;#39;s an invisible spread I&amp;#39;m just like not seeing to the uh the shots themselves it&amp;#39;s bizarre cuz a lot of the time it doesn&amp;#39;t end up going where it says it go that&amp;#39;s a kyst oh oh gosh I&amp;#39;m sorry blood oats hope you&amp;#39;re fine now that sounds really really obnoxious to deal with I&amp;#39;m sorry bud I still know quite what we&amp;#39;re collecting these for got to be real with you I&amp;#39;ve not seen like oh yeah I think I think I know I think I know I might know that was fairly early in the game so that would be crazy if that&amp;#39;s what it was but you know video game ST be like that s kidney zone I&amp;#39;m sorry while accounts that [ __ ] is painful very very painful not fun I&amp;#39;m sorry you had to go through that sleeping can be the best part of your day I always start by getting ready for bed first I get myj we can get in the music studio now all we did not have access to before yeah sure is or we can&amp;#39;t because it&amp;#39;s blocked off Suites are pretty good I learned my numbers when I was a kid here let me show you how I learned hold your hands up in the air now bring them down in front of your face see that&amp;#39;s two hands now take one of your hands put it in your mouth and swallow as hard as you can now you have one hand inside of your stomach and one hand outside this is the best part take your other hand put it next to the hand in your mouth and swallow again now you have two hands in your stomach that&amp;#39;s how numbers work oh don&amp;#39;t don&amp;#39;t forget to hack your hands back up all righty then yeah what he [Music] said we can&amp;#39;t go in here now yeah oh okay so this isn&amp;#39;t okay so we got to kind of good day Norman had a bad day he that yeah that was H something what was Lana big mouse yeah so she scared you got cut off at traffic okay so this I don&amp;#39;t have the final thing for so that&amp;#39;s what I&amp;#39;m trying to find right now it&amp;#39;s the final mask for that why does this feel very like boss figh is I not even go up here or can I lo from this side yeah I imagine that&amp;#39;ll probably unlock when I find the last mask yeah that seems very boss fighty see we got to find got to get back to the projection room bending the machine kind of yeah it&amp;#39;s kind of like bendy machine but at least bending in machine was kind of creepy this is not how do I get back to the projection room I go up to the theater back to main hall is that what I do maybe go this game currently so we were so essentially this uh all right she&amp;#39;s very distracting um um so the this is a a television station Tower and it&amp;#39;s supposed to be shut down but it turned back on and started taking over the television channels like it turned itself back on and started taking over the taking over the television channels back in um [ __ ] um the telin channels so they sent me just like a repair man like a normal dude to go be like okay well go make sure it&amp;#39;s shut off and instead we find that like hey the Sesame Street characters were alive all along and apparently it was just a that&amp;#39;s always been a thing and they it just alluded to that they turned it back on themselves well how do we get to the projection room it says there&amp;#39;s stairwells is it the main hall hey B how&amp;#39;s it going homie how are they I don&amp;#39;t like how big man here I guess I feel that I&amp;#39;m going to have to duck in one here just to despawn him anyways cuz he is he is big scary how am I liking uh my friendly neighborhood it&amp;#39;s pretty cool I do wish it was a little bit more like core based oh we get there through like oh okay I see I see yeah the the the combat and stuff is more like Bioshock except minus the powers at least FNAF had like kind of like a creepy Edge to it this does not have that for the most part there&amp;#39;s a there&amp;#39;s a couple moments where you&amp;#39;re like for the most part it&amp;#39;s like just kind of like completely campy all right this is where I need to be oh no there&amp;#39;s a puzzle you got to go watch the TV 1979 number 16 puppet space Quest out of touch with reality two out of five stars oh there nothing particularly wrong with puppet space Quest the latest edition of the my friendly neigh media franchise once again we join the pupp as they embark on another grand Adventure this time on a journey to find the planet uong it&amp;#39;s the name of a pig and Dragon Ball and once again we are joined by a Hess B tier celebrity to provide some dramatic cor to the neighbors Antics it&amp;#39;s all well constructed and even amusing the problem is that we&amp;#39;re just it&amp;#39;s just what we come to expect from the G Wilds felt friends which that&amp;#39;s most about the film is the share barness of the trans lunar landscape and I don&amp;#39;t mean just visually there are no dazzling Treasures celebrity dreams or got wrenching crime spres to hold the audience&amp;#39;s attention all the space has is mfm&amp;#39;s tired childish moral Vision even when they travel to the other side of the universe probs can only offer moth and yarn okay oh that&amp;#39;s not a that&amp;#39;s not the cartoon why are there just bacon and egg plates everywhere hey there are space Quest do I have to find this is the only place I had left to go so I&amp;#39;m kind of like kind of confused cuz this we need to find one more mask what the alphabet what&amp;#39;s the alphabet that&amp;#39;s easy it&amp;#39;s what word to me now you mean like the ones that I see in my books yeah so like where&amp;#39;s this last MK I thought and he walked in we had a whole K scene with the big guy walking in just watching it but he&amp;#39;s not distracted

diamond rooms I think unless the thing&amp;#39;s not used yeah we have another Diamond Room well technically there&amp;#39;s Diamond rooms in other areas he&amp;#39;s in a really bad spot I no matter which way I go he&amp;#39;s going to chase me there&amp;#39;s a Green Key room music studio is entirely blocked off do we go I don&amp;#39;t know where we go feel like the projection room should have had more to it did I am I missing the reels or do I have to find the reels around the map or something there&amp;#39;s this thing it looks like there&amp;#39;s something missing so I have to find something to be able to do that puzzle doesn&amp;#39;t look like I have that [Music] yet yeah it says the projection room is cleared so it&amp;#39;s not like I&amp;#39;m missing something in there

imag with zombies uh it&amp;#39;s in an abandoned uh D Street Studio and the puppets are evil that&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s happening very interesting I almost just knocked my drink over that was kind of scary that was the scariest thing that&amp;#39;s happened so far hey I&amp;#39;m Norman Le machine rooms right here we just go and put it right here this should fix that elevator you trash collection we we did interact with the character that was like oscar but he&amp;#39;s in the basement theab theab elevator go oh we&amp;#39;re here not jumping down with you there oh no they have level design good level design [Music] weird piece what the [ __ ] is the pump piece a boiler I don&amp;#39;t even know where that would go right now I don&amp;#39;t think I&amp;#39;ve seen anything that needs that one of the reals okay okay okay so we do got to find those we&amp;#39;re in a bathroom we&amp;#39;re not going to do like the bathroom scare at all I don&amp;#39;t like that I

alphabet Oh that&amp;#39;s easy it&amp;#39;s What bird are made of her voice I&amp;#39;m going to save cuz I have done a lot my last save wrong room wrong room other room cross the way why are you here now we our arms then we that melee got some that melee I was seeing if I can snipe them but I could not unfortunately you run up and down the street make sure every neighbor by yeah I should have just shot it but I was I was going to see if you could like react smack them just just for testing purposes turns out you cannot turn that the hard way that&amp;#39;s okay you live you learn yeah we&amp;#39;re good we&amp;#39;re good yeah we&amp;#39;re fine you don&amp;#39;t need to mess with that don&amp;#39;t got to put anything away don&amp;#39;t got to take anything out I just didn&amp;#39;t want to die and have to redo something cuz we we got a lot done what do you do when you get [Music] upet this is only kind of like obnoxious thing about Ari games and AR likes is there&amp;#39;s a lot of backtracking hey Norman says that line that&amp;#39;s not your lineal that&amp;#39;s what Norman says you can&amp;#39;t steal his line I go to the projector room on side one of the best things about the res evil about resent Evil games res evil likes is that uh you get it when there&amp;#39;s good level design like this game has you get a sense of direction and you don&amp;#39;t even need to look at the map as much all right [Music] cism of women eating apple and woods what the [ __ ] what what is this well it&amp;#39;s stock footage but like why is this in a game about puppet depressed can we go talk right now Chernobyl dude you know what&amp;#39;s the coolest thing about Chernobyl I I love talking about this thing bu you know the [ __ ] elephant&amp;#39;s foot you guys know what that is coolest [ __ ] in the planet coolest [ __ ] I mean the most radioactive dangerous thing in the planet and still is radioactive and dangerous not a clue so there&amp;#39;s at the bottom of Chernobyl where it melted down there&amp;#39;s a thing called the elephant&amp;#39;s foot and it&amp;#39;s just like this pile of [ __ ] um just like radioactive [ __ ] and it&amp;#39;s like I forget the specifics but essentially like standing in that room is enough to like essentially kill you just like being near it like just in any vicinity without any sort of protection will kill you very very quickly it&amp;#39;s just like one of the most dangerous places on the planet because of the um just like the amount of nuclear concentration I hate when I do that yeah this is right but it&amp;#39;s really cool you should look into it sometime I don&amp;#39;t know I just find it fascinating that like there is something on this planet that even if you are like in a general vicinity it&amp;#39;ll [ __ ] like it&amp;#39;ll just like you&amp;#39;re just dead and that&amp;#39;s it and the thing is that it&amp;#39;s like it&amp;#39;s not even going to be like like like for like immense amount of time like even as it the radio activity sometimes huh it&amp;#39;s not going to get better for an incredibly long period of time first time I ever saw a movie as a kid there was this scene of a man riding into this big blazing Sunset and I remember when it came up it just caught me I don&amp;#39;t know if it was the plot or the music or what but my heart just suddenly left like like I had just heard an old friend calling my name and I sort of forgot myself and turned around thinking someone was behind me but all I saw was a little star of light coming from the projection booth no one else turned around they all were just focused on the screen but it felt so real so solid never knew what to make of that and eventually I forgot about it I guess during the War I got distracted he&amp;#39;s a veteran just came back to me now interesting about this fake war that we&amp;#39;ve been talking about Gordon help goblet oh there&amp;#39;s a we do unlock the West slot with this diamond key outside and the room all the way back in stage four this is my favorite part of resent Evil games is there a lot of fun little stuff by backtracking might do a little bit of that I&amp;#39;m here oh what I you okay that the one thing the melee is very very wonky like literally like I have killed her so many times for this exact position and now she&amp;#39;s she could suddenly hit me from back here like huh the melee is very very weird sometimes obviously because like there&amp;#39;s this invisible like wall there where like something they can and cannot hit you and you can hit them you know it&amp;#39;s like it&amp;#39;s very hard to tell like where that line is so if you&amp;#39;re trying to like kite and be careful you&amp;#39;re just going to get like [ __ ] off or you can&amp;#39;t get [ __ ] on stick to the guns yeah I just used to like preserving ammo as much as I can that&amp;#39;s just my uh Instinct you&amp;#39;re all friendly here friendly friendly friendly I can see you s of things it doesn&amp;#39;t look like there&amp;#39;s a diamond thing in the basement at all we don&amp;#39;t have to go here there&amp;#39;s no diamond you can do all SS of things stupid dumb [ __ ] [ __ ] ridiculous dude that actually Wass the [ __ ] out of me I took that Health State there cuz I and I didn&amp;#39;t have to cuz I I cannot tell you how many times I&amp;#39;ve snuck up behind him in that exact spot and hit him and just randomly sometimes the game&amp;#39;s like no I actually can reach you there and it just seems so inconsistent it [ __ ] annoys the [ __ ] out of me when you go to the all wild I think I guess I would just have to go back outside that would be the way to I guess yeah cuz we got to unlock the thing out there and also we can backtrack a little as well but this uh this ends up in the slide we can&amp;#39;t go out this way yeah because that&amp;#39;s the slide we can&amp;#39;t go out that direction the everything I out the window the M we&amp;#39;re all friendly here friendly friendly friendly to think uh where I could go to do that to get back outside think where I can go to do that yeah literally like I hate I hate to say it cuz it is kind of one of the main appeals of the game but them y them just like nonstop ranting is really starting to give me a [ __ ] headache like it really is starting it like it was cute at first but now I just want them to shut the [ __ ] up why ises it show that I can leave through here like if you look there&amp;#39;s like little door things over here my homework and went to bed early I used to be responsible I figured out that instead of being responsible I could justat grav inste could she gravel instead I maybe I can go through the lounge lch isal of the day always don&amp;#39;t hate it till you try yeah my bad sleep when you go to the park bring some food for all the wild animals [Music] if the idea was get to get me to eventually hate them it&amp;#39;s definitely working I&amp;#39;m definitely okay new room new room oh look at their little action figures that&amp;#39;s cute say I didn&amp;#39;t get everything in here yep there&amp;#39;s a coin locked where does this go oh that&amp;#39;s what this is oh oh well going save if we end up needing being like a boss fight I need if I need my shotgun I&amp;#39;ll just reload otherwise going to going to go in wall would love to have a view like this maybe this will unlock the front door Heavy Metal Key it seems really old oh I see could all loock the music studio too potentially got that to look forward to that&amp;#39;s it that&amp;#39;s all you get out of this that&amp;#39;s such an seems like such a low important area to have like not much in it not even like a lore page or anything weird very very weird think I&amp;#39;ll just take the elevator back down game&amp;#39;s actually fairly long I did not like I know it&amp;#39;s like a you know they made me pay for a full release but like it seems like okay there it is maybe this is the boss fight in question now we have so much stuff want to put the wrench away for now if we&amp;#39;re just going to be in a boss fight because I I doubt we&amp;#39;re going to be using the wrench mid fight for any reason yeah this is why the Auto sort and part foric this reason freaking gosh please I just stash the coins in here can I still use them what do you mean box full I&amp;#39;m going to scream please just let me play the video game I don&amp;#39;t want to play this dumb little [ __ ] mini game I just want to play just let me get my shotgun out please you be my best friend thank you thank you thank you for letting me play I don&amp;#39;t think I&amp;#39;m going to be needing to tape things right away we can other people find this fun I just find it tedious there we go that&amp;#39;s what I want oh but I can&amp;#39;t save because I don&amp;#39;t have any [ __ ] coins in my [ __ ] okay stash that take coins out I wish if you just had coins in your stash it would just count you don&amp;#39;t have to carry them on you that&amp;#39; be a nice little quality of life thing that would be really simple hopefully I assume it would be simple let me buy a that&amp;#39;s just like not a boss fight at all and I&amp;#39;m just prepping for nothing I&amp;#39;m like okay and I&amp;#39;m going to go fight it and it&amp;#39;s just like a c it&amp;#39;s going to need me to pick up like an 18 square item just to like progress something like that you know what&amp;#39;s that shooting dead puppets at me that a floating stage oh God yeah that&amp;#39;s right get out of here I think I spent more time organizing my inventory than I did actually fighting the thing I think I spent more time organizing my inventory okay Gordon what&amp;#39;s next to fight it than I did actually playing it okay first do this so we can hopefully make this red key no the red key won&amp;#39;t become useless but we&amp;#39;re just going to go and do this right now public park pring for nothing at all yeah just so I could throw like three grenades and call it a day right okay we got that now I&amp;#39;m going to go we&amp;#39;re going to do a little bit of good old classic res evil backtracking there&amp;#39;s a room in stage 4 playing on baby easy gooo mode I&amp;#39;m playing on normal mode what do you mean I&amp;#39;m not even playing on easy normal is the game the game&amp;#39;s intention of its own difficulty it is everything else is either made like worse or everything is made either easier for easy mode or harder for Hard Mode this is the intended version of the game it says there&amp;#39;s something here I didn&amp;#39;t pick up I don&amp;#39;t know what though oh there&amp;#39;s a token in there right good okay so we go straight ahead there&amp;#39;s a diamond key door sleeping can be the best part of your day I always start by getting ready for bed first I get my PJs on so I can be warm I&amp;#39;m a friend po pad bit Brokey yeah I just threw three grenades and the the boss fight&amp;#39;s over I&amp;#39;m like okay them all around Duos what&amp;#39;s so important that

halfway point of the game was cuz I we were already at the what would be considered oh we&amp;#39;re actually close to the end we&amp;#39;re getting closer to the end yeah we&amp;#39;re getting closer to the end cuz yeah completing the studio is like 2third of the way through for most people so yeah or at least it looks like I&amp;#39;m going to get some stash one of those get take some of my tape

lucky I haven&amp;#39;t been hugged to death or eaten okay I admit we&amp;#39;re not at the top of our game but you can&amp;#39;t throw us out just because we&amp;#39;ve made a few mistakes uhhuh I&amp;#39;m just doing my job uhhuh sure I take it blasting your way through hords of allegedly Psychopathic puppets is a normal day at work for you H seriously Gordon who hurt you I don&amp;#39;t know what you&amp;#39;re talking about no so you were just born a bully I&amp;#39;m not a bully surprised you&amp;#39;re not a detective they&amp;#39;re always bashing down doors and or maybe a gi give you a chance to Rampage through some small defens don&amp;#39;t say that Ricky oh [ __ ] say what don&amp;#39;t talk about the war why not just saying seems like exactly the sort of place you got oh we just shot Ricky but YouTuber talks about Nintendo oh I know that person I&amp;#39;ve never I I I&amp;#39;ve watched like maybe like one of their videos but like I know of the person you&amp;#39;re talking about I&amp;#39;m not into their videos but like gor lur why is he even here he&amp;#39;s supposed to he&amp;#39;s he&amp;#39;s who they sent to turn off the uh antenna that they&amp;#39;re using to like take over TV with the uh my friendly neighborhood uh broadcast yeah he&amp;#39;s they sent to stop it just blow it up okay I&amp;#39;m assuming that&amp;#39;s where I do go so I&amp;#39;m going to like walk around a bit see if there&amp;#39;s an alternate way to go okay that never mind that&amp;#39;s literally literally just the other side of where we came from why it&amp;#39;s abandoned I&amp;#39;m no not not yet I&amp;#39;m assuming well there&amp;#39;s been some hints so far that like the show was kind of going downhill and the movies were sucking so what was that okay 1981 at a last night I was watching a reun one of those old news reels from the war one of the one one of the stories jumped out me in one operation a platoon soldiers found themselves trapped in a collapsing mine as they ran to the entrance one of the Timbers supporting the tunnel began to fall until a private Joshua heart rght caught it on his shoulders as he held up the wood his friend scrambled out under his unstretched arms until after everyone was out he let go and the tunnel collapsed on him buring him forever in the earth when I heard that story I found a mixture of emotions pity for the waste of human life anger at the injustices of War and most of all I was horrified horrified that a person might do such a thing horrified that it was held up as inspiration play down your life for someone else to lose everything they have the veil torn have the scratch of your life vanish into nothingness how can anyone ask someone else to do that how would you do that voluntarily and if you don&amp;#39;t they call you a coward interesting I didn&amp;#39;t even end up using that [ __ ] that candy bar I plan to use it in the boss fight but you could you ended up playing the boss fight pretty stationary I was like well if I have to dodge a bunch I&amp;#39;m going to like I&amp;#39;m going to uh got to give him food cool pups probably haven&amp;#39;t been fed in a long time okay got to feed the puppies I&amp;#39;m just going to eat it [ __ ] it num num be fast it&amp;#39;s just taking up inventory space at the moment anyway looks like it drains with chemicals wrong maybe I can use this to dissolve whatever&amp;#39;s blocking the elevator in the hotel get my handy dandy Photoshop going on over here let&amp;#39;s s by playing this compound add the following into lumaflex film developer weed out weed killer seal pump trumpet polish turn on the water using the tap press the fing buttons for the indicated times two 1 two 3 four 2 three oh got the Green Key now we got to come back for it is really annoying do we even have a safe spot here yet we do it&amp;#39;s just all the way back there uh it&amp;#39;s lit almost not worth it to bring the shotgun at all just cuz there&amp;#39;s like it just takes up so much space SP and the ammo for it also takes up way too much space just like not even it doesn&amp;#39;t feel worth it are your evil I don&amp;#39;t want to I don&amp;#39;t want to hurt you okay I&amp;#39;m going to put all my shotgun [ __ ] away again cuz this it just takes up too much space rather just be without it box full okay yeah they&amp;#39;re cuties I don&amp;#39;t want to shoot them if I don&amp;#39;t have to cuz they&amp;#39;re adorable yeah oh oh oh oh no I feel that warning no oh oh they&amp;#39;re just Invincible you can&amp;#39;t tape them okay neat good to [ __ ] know I love that they&amp;#39;re just [ __ ] Invincible sick you can only stun them good to [ __ ] know good to know be in the first place yeah but I can&amp;#39;t do that yet so it&amp;#39;s stupid makes me mad oh I see so I kind of see that like potentially it&amp;#39;s making it&amp;#39;s going to make me do a lot of backtrack yeah through all

[ __ ] there&amp;#39;s so many ades here we have found so many grenades in such a short succession it&amp;#39;s kind of kind of spooky oh we already cleared this room that&amp;#39;s all that&amp;#39;s in here what learned the alphabet what&amp;#39;s the alphabet Oh that&amp;#39;s easy it&amp;#39;s what words are made out of you like that I see in my books I remember those A is for a M okay then we got to get the fim why are you here why are you here why are they everywhere now oh my gosh it&amp;#39;s bodying me oh my gosh I don&amp;#39;t like these areas having the hounds now because we can&amp;#39;t tape them so they&amp;#39;re just like they&amp;#39;re just permanently a problem the statue&amp;#39;s alive I was wondering why that looked weird it&amp;#39;s the statue of him that&amp;#39;s alive not his actual like not his actual like or his Muppet but his statue that&amp;#39;s that was creepy okay so projection room you just go to any of these side rooms and go up and over that&amp;#39;s how you get there oh you have to go upstairs for that not this floor the next floor and then we&amp;#39;re good you a horror game cuz the funest thing ever I don&amp;#39;t think it was kind of like marketed it&amp;#39;s kind of like a like a spooky game but like it&amp;#39;s not it&amp;#39;s actually not like there hasn&amp;#39;t really been there&amp;#39;s kind of like some creepy off-handed lines that they make sometime sometimes like there&amp;#39;s one where [ __ ] one of the puppets is like shove your hands inside your mouth and then swallow and then shove the other hand inside your mouth and then [Music] swallow oh the guy that that&amp;#39;s you isn&amp;#39;t it yeah you stood up I see you here there&amp;#39;s jump scares occasionally It&amp;#39;s just sometimes the the the puppets and their little dialogue they say something like really like out there that like a you know a kid&amp;#39;s thing shouldn&amp;#39;t be saying like I Feast on the tears of my enemies was one of them and it&amp;#39;s like oh seven 7 12 four 7 124 that&amp;#39;s a secret to something on 124 right that down that that sound gives me flashbacks to like Cooper cuz that&amp;#39;s the same uh sound that plays that that plays in that game we can get into the music studio now here as well might as well do that while we&amp;#39;re here it&amp;#39;s just satisfying okay I can&amp;#39;t help it I can&amp;#39;t help that we&amp;#39;re in tell you I got some questions I need just on the premise that they take so much ammo I just get rid of them every time I just tape them every time because I don&amp;#39;t want to deal with that 1981 mfn studos Market Ser recent years&amp;#39;s television viewership assur and TV programming has been multiplied Diversified as BR is scambled to capitalize on a rapidly growing audience new favores like crime city and drama have grown quickly in popularity as the war generation ages in their children beginning to enter the world ranks of adulthood and imitate their viewing habits I&amp;#39;m trying to re shut up in the same period however my friendly neighborhood&amp;#39;s ratings are plummeted while survey suggested the show is as popular as ever under with the under six crowd the new generation of parents is less and less interested in showing it to their children preferring instead or mainstream offerings like dinosaur Mayhem I love dinosaur Mayhem that sounds like Power Rangers that&amp;#39;s probably what they&amp;#39;re referring to this has prompted the city networking to put pressure on imagine a couple principles of the series first I uh well that was their fault for naming their kid Leonard who name&amp;#39;s their kid Leonard man IP his face a Ah that&amp;#39;s one of the things we need that&amp;#39;s one of the things we need yeah yeah for the uh mixture oh that&amp;#39;s blocked that&amp;#39;s why we can&amp;#39;t get through there there&amp;#39;s just a bunch of [ __ ] there we&amp;#39;re going get we can get through there on the other side my question is where&amp;#39;s the third thing oh there&amp;#39;s a conference room upstairs that we have to get to so we got to go to the east office I&amp;#39;m going to West currently at East office another Green Key area sleeping can be the best part of your day I always start by getting ready for bed first I get my DJs on so I can be warm and com bubble [Music] don&amp;#39;t like y&amp;#39;all being in here oh that&amp;#39;s her on the other floor I was like what am I hearing cuz she&amp;#39;s directly below us find five cheat I don&amp;#39;t think we use those till or in this play through need to have them though I guess that&amp;#39;s it that&amp;#39;s all that&amp;#39;s in here where do we find that last we need trumpet polish or what a what a the way he flew at me made me think that I was about to be attacked okay I guess there&amp;#39;s some other areas we haven&amp;#39;t been to out here like through the Avary and stuff like that oh there&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s a green door in stage 4 Green Door St 4 that we have not done it&amp;#39;s probably something we need to do this is we hav pick something up here in the crawl space where could something be even oh there&amp;#39;s a just just a piece of tape laying on the floor okay so we can actually get there from here I believe if we take the [Music] elevator see that like sometimes you&amp;#39;ll be aiming directly at something and like shooting it it won&amp;#39;t work I don&amp;#39;t know why something weird the hit detection or what the male the ma comes every day I look out the window waiting for the moment it appears notice a big green lady she doesn&amp;#39;t come after me anymore now that we&amp;#39;ve uh done her plot done her story so I guess she&amp;#39;s just like off the record for now not the perk not the perk I think if you take this elevator over here it takes you to it takes you to stage 4 no does it or does it take you the basement it takes you the basement below stage 4 but I think we unlocked a shortcut to stage 4 from that area is what I&amp;#39;m thinking of I think I could be wrong I hope I&amp;#39;m right cuz that&amp;#39;s going to be a lot of annoying backtracking if I did not if I&amp;#39;m incorrect about that there&amp;#39;s also another green thing down here use basement maybe that&amp;#39;s where I need to go East basement yeah I got to go to East basement guess it&amp;#39;s good I came down here anyway we got to go to their left yeah that actually does it was cute at first but now I just want him to be quiet yeah I got to go up moments then why are you here now they really are just going to shove oh you&amp;#39;re not uh I didn&amp;#39;t know that I never knew that I never knew that you&amp;#39;re apparently not paused while in the map it&amp;#39;s good to [ __ ] know good to know game good to know good to know cool found that out the hard way you can you think I&amp;#39;m in the [ __ ] mood stupid okay all right good give it deal hatred take your right PLS into my side oh oh cool this just doesn&amp;#39;t go where it&amp;#39;s supposed to I just it&amp;#39;s just caved in Crazy Crush Mark Vasa or copy pasta what is it I don&amp;#39;t think I&amp;#39;ve ever heard of that one is the only way to get over there by boat now is that the only way how do I get over there oh this is annoying no no no no no no no no I [ __ ] hate it here oh that yeah I I&amp;#39;ve actually heard of that okay the boat&amp;#39;s not here so what the how do I get over there again do I literally have to go okay do I literally have to go up and over and back cuz that&amp;#39;s what it&amp;#39;s seeming like it seems like I have to go up and over back into the garden and take I&amp;#39;m going to [ __ ] scream [ __ ] off Ray you&amp;#39;re actually unironically pissing me the [ __ ] off so I have to go all the way back to the garden and take that one elevator because it it doesn&amp;#39;t want me to have freedom of movement why are they everywhere oh my God this part&amp;#39;s [ __ ] annoying with the dogs this part&amp;#39;s [ __ ] annoying with the non-stop [ __ ] dogs all the [ __ ] time it&amp;#39;s really [ __ ] irritating [ __ ] this part just just nonstop nonstop [ __ ] [ __ ] just just non [ __ ] stop enemies [ __ ] everywhere as [ __ ] annoying as what it is okay I have to do all the studio stuff again I just realized too cuz I I thought I said I thought I had saved in the uh Studio but I didn&amp;#39;t so we&amp;#39;re a little bit farther back it&amp;#39;s is [ __ ] annoying dude like being rushed by that thing I don&amp;#39;t have to be in this studio do I no stage four I have to be at stage four so I do have I did have to come back here anyway I have to go down to floor one when you go to the park bring some food for all the wild animals for bird dogs are just a stun lock yeah and it&amp;#39;s just like if you could tape them like you could everything else it&amp;#39; be fine but you can&amp;#39;t like you can&amp;#39;t tape them like you can everything else so like they just get to be Invincible like literally there&amp;#39;s just Invincible enemies that you can&amp;#39;t put down and they put you in a stun lock like you said with the other [ __ ] dudes and you&amp;#39;re just like okay cool when you go to the park bring some food all wild anim feel that morning dogs are the dogs are dumb the dog enemies are [ __ ] stupid in this [Music] game AR dogs but worse AR dogs are pretty easy to manage these guys like put you in a stun lock to where you&amp;#39;re not allowed to do anything just pretty [ __ ] stupid it&amp;#39;s even take me where I want to be it will yeah what key is this playground key okay oh it goes to the top of the playground I know yeah yeah yeah I know where that goes like literally the top of that little jungle gym that they have and I can&amp;#39;t carry the shotgun cuz I feel like the shotgun would be a pretty good way to deal with them CU a shotgun takes like 10 [ __ ] oh that&amp;#39;s her I was like why is that thing not [Music] flying cu the shotgun takes up way too much [ __ ] space I&amp;#39;m can&amp;#39;t tape them yeah like the fact that you can&amp;#39;t tape them means that they&amp;#39;re just there or like if they&amp;#39;re stunned they&amp;#39;re stunned for like a longer duration that would make me happy wait what was the point of this wait why did I unlock this what does this do oh here oh this is not good yeah you have to [ __ ] go out there and look at where they all are and mimic it that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s annoying especially with the dogs there that&amp;#39;s annoying that&amp;#39;s a really piss puzzle that&amp;#39;s that that [ __ ] sucks I don&amp;#39;t know who thought this was a good idea with the [ __ ] dogs there there that that&amp;#39;s annoying game it&amp;#39;s pretty it was pretty fun it&amp;#39;s just like this part with the with these things these [ __ ] the like the My Fun ended when they introduced those dumbass enemies those the [ __ ] dumb dogs that you can&amp;#39;t [ __ ] tape like they those guys [ __ ] suck and they&amp;#39;re single-handedly making me like hate this second half of the game here like that shit&amp;#39;s [ __ ] stupid I hate that like it makes me want to bring I didn&amp;#39;t even put their the real s well I don&amp;#39;t even yeah I got still got to do that I guess are you able to get their food first I don&amp;#39;t know where their food is like if I was [ __ ] Clairvoyant and I was cheating and I was looking everything up yeah maybe but I don&amp;#39;t know where their food is so I don&amp;#39;t know I just got to got to deal with it until I&amp;#39;m Clairvoyant and just understand just guess where their food&amp;#39;s at and I just have too much [ __ ] to be able to [ __ ] tr to go back into the [ __ ] thing over here and well likes a headache it [ __ ] is like straight up just is okay so we start here right here at Leo that&amp;#39;s Leonard I&amp;#39;m just going to use colors on my little photop thing over here Mark these this is one those things that if I wasn&amp;#39;t doing a blind playthrough I would just look this part up CU this is stupid I like I said kind of a shame because the game was is really fun up until this point which just this part&amp;#39;s kind of just really [ __ ] annoying green for that person this is the one where there&amp;#39;s three of them and now I have to very quickly okay that&amp;#39;s Ricky so blue meanwhile I&amp;#39;m just wasting ammo over here okay that&amp;#39;s uh Pearl what a big pee next to her yeah this is just an ammo snc on them because you can never do away them like the Miss egg wow yeah this guy this is the cop guy or the taxi driver guy he&amp;#39;s going to be yellow I guess purple and green for her is the colors I&amp;#39;ll use purple green who&amp;#39;s the last person wait who&amp;#39;s the last person so there&amp;#39;s one of them I guess we could just use PR elimination right okay so you are here the three of you here Ricky is here you&amp;#39;re the green person Pearl&amp;#39;s on the outside Leo&amp;#39;s here okay is that not correct or she left and he&amp;#39;s the other one there you go okay we got the weed out this Brute Force this puzzle yeah that just would have taken forever that would have been that would have been a long time it&amp;#39;s they&amp;#39;re literally everywhere too like they&amp;#39;re literally all over the [ __ ] place yeah the only way into the basement on east side is through that elevator and I didn&amp;#39;t realize that going down the basement that they collapsed that tunnel for literally no reason so now we just got a deal okay so now we got to go we go back to the studio we got to go down to the basement like got a lot to do I should probably go to the studio first is there a way I can hold on I&amp;#39;m going to go back here is there a shortcut or something back here that I could use that isn&amp;#39;t yeah I&amp;#39;m going to try to use the see if there&amp;#39;s a shortcut here cuz I don&amp;#39;t want to [ __ ] deal with that [ __ ] A lot of backtracking it is and it&amp;#39;s not even like the fun kind this is literally the like time to revisit every every area you&amp;#39;ve ever played in the game section which you know is the thing that kind of made me dislike Silent Hill 4 was that that was kind of what they did cuz it&amp;#39;s essentially just the same [ __ ] game all over again except like now there&amp;#39;s just more annoying enemies everywhere so it&amp;#39;s like pads out it&amp;#39;s not actually new content you&amp;#39;re just not the real reutilizing areas is necessarily a bad thing yeah I got to go right left right not that recycling areas is necessarily a bad thing but when it&amp;#39;s literally just like running through the exact same routes with just with like harder more annoying enemies it&amp;#39;s just like not as I just really to this is the right place right yeah go right mortal enemies are just not great yeah the fact that they&amp;#39;re just like outright Immortal it&amp;#39;s just really dumb I don&amp;#39;t mind that they&amp;#39;re like I actually don&amp;#39;t mind that they&amp;#39;re Immortal it&amp;#39;s just like like their stun time is like 2 seconds and they&amp;#39;re faster than you so raise layer stay away okay boy hey hey that&amp;#39;s not going to fix [Applause] it oh that&amp;#39;s what we need this for plug seems incomplete oh okay what do you want yeah I fixed fix I I I just look when when you&amp;#39;ve got a problem you can&amp;#39;t just clim up and start hitting everything with a wrench that won&amp;#39;t fix anything good well I&amp;#39;m going now oh I helped the right okay so we completed race story I wonder if that&amp;#39;s like really rubber ducky hey creeps hope you enjoyed the rest of your stream earlier today it was a cozy watch so that&amp;#39;s what we&amp;#39;re doing I think is we&amp;#39;re uh by completing everybody&amp;#39;s plots that&amp;#39;s probably like how we get the good ending by helping all the uh the big puppets of each area okay we got to do all this studio stuff all over again stra stream yeah we&amp;#39;re in kind of a more annoying part of the game unfortunately but that&amp;#39;s okay it happens not every part of the game can be the same level of quality I&amp;#39;m a friend shut up hopefully it stop some of that air in here take one of your hands into your mouth I like watching her run at me once I&amp;#39;m getting the elevator oh [ __ ] that&amp;#39;s right that&amp;#39;s right map You&amp;#39;re Not Safe map you&amp;#39;re not safe okay I needed to be on the other side but least we&amp;#39;re not getting [ __ ] clobbered y we&amp;#39;re down to 89 [ __ ] bullets because we keep having to stun these guys like this is ridiculous like we are we are actively burning through resources at an alarming rate to try and [ __ ] like get around this can I please not yeah d as [ __ ] dude so [ __ ] stupid naan is naan is raiding me raiding me raing meing me me yo Nathan so good to see you homie thank you for raing how&amp;#39;s it how is your stream I don&amp;#39;t know why I said it like that just cuz I&amp;#39;m weird hope you had a good time friend

had in this game it is ass absolute ass [ __ ] terrible don&amp;#39;t ever make me do that again all right we got to do all that studio stuff we did earlier but we reloaded and we had to backtrack there&amp;#39;s also some stuff we got to explore in the aary not the are a area itself but the area behind it okay we got to go to the music studio which is straight aheading to the right made stream thanks bud I definitely think it&amp;#39;s worth getting it&amp;#39;s definitely a very fun game if you like resid Evil games it&amp;#39;s definitely worth it it&amp;#39;s also be real it&amp;#39;s pretty good YouTube bait you know it is just you it is like it&amp;#39;s good YouTube bait so if you make content we&amp;#39;re out of okay I mean it sounded like you were like really far away but then you were just on me so that&amp;#39;s pretty cool okay this is the trumpet polish so this is the last thing alphabet gun thank you I&amp;#39;m teaching them their ABCs so this is the last thing we need for that puzzle so now we&amp;#39;re good but there is a little thing we can grab upstairs real quick that I will be grabbing real quick every single item yeah it&amp;#39;s just like it&amp;#39;s like it&amp;#39;s like a godsend to people who are fidgety what do you do when you get upset do you I shoot you in the face so we put this in we watch this and then we cross over to the other side we go up number one all right get that out of here play it we already have the combination I will still watch it in case the game&amp;#39;s like oh unless you sit and watch it it

here go watch them all yeah those things are I do not like those things what do I need to grab for here that&amp;#39;s wait this is a secret room where all you grab is the coins I think there was a tape in here maybe the tape&amp;#39;s just like once you unlock them you have them I&amp;#39;m I was to talk responsibility see I us to be all upside down I think responsibility one day we&amp;#39;ll

were but it made it worse yeah it&amp;#39;s just kind of like sad there&amp;#39;s a certain point where that [ __ ] just gets sad like it&amp;#39;s no longer funny it&amp;#39;s just like dude you could have made something good and you made this pile of [ __ ] instead so going go all the way around it looks like and then red key lunch is my favorite meal of the day I always eat the food that most represents how I&amp;#39;m feeling at lunch there we go this is creepy oh and here&amp;#39;s the safe uh seven 12 four okay there we go wait huh wait what was that it&amp;#39;s a fuse combination

production after one the puppet forers Ray attempted to hit him with the cloth iron during an onset conversation the frus erupted after Brony made critical comments about the show&amp;#39;s creative Direction including Al gersal according night Witnesses it&amp;#39;s always been like this on set interview it&amp;#39;s not just Ray Pearl goblet Ricky they&amp;#39;re all crazy it&amp;#39;s been a long time coming one takes me seriously when I&amp;#39;m because I&amp;#39;m on mfn I&amp;#39;m ready to make sure that&amp;#39;s widely recognized okay okay buddy it&amp;#39;s not that deep what the [ __ ] is this thing what is this hello what in the eldrid [ __ ] is happening here okay that&amp;#39;s just in the [ __ ] set storage down here I guess okay so isal of the day okay well that&amp;#39;s certainly something now we got to backtrack all the way back to the [ __ ] got to backtrack all the way to the [ __ ] uh basement [Music] again hey Sean how are friend here let me show you I hopefully you&amp;#39;re Saturday streaming you well we can go out the back here now that we have that unlocked oh yeah I&amp;#39;m all right I was sick mostly today so I&amp;#39;m a little fatigued from being sick but otherwise I&amp;#39;m fine other I&amp;#39;m okay exercise those got me feeling better for the most part yeah I&amp;#39;m not like on cloud n or anything but I&amp;#39;m not as sick as I was like I said it&amp;#39;s mostly just fatigue I&amp;#39;m mostly just tired they threw somebody out it says this area is red which means I haven&amp;#39;t picked something up here there we go is that it it is okay is is red key done now red key is done now and green key red key and green key are done so I can throw those away trumpet polish close to end when I looked at the uh defeating the uh like the studio was like two3 of the way through so yeah that&amp;#39;s what I was looking at so now we got to go over here go to the basement I&amp;#39;m actually going to pull up that file real quick and put it in my pH phot shop over here uh stage no no that&amp;#39;s what I wanted so I don&amp;#39;t have to keep pulling it out mid uh combination this a mystery game it&amp;#39;s kind of like resid evil except instead of being stuck in a in a place with zombies in a mansion you&amp;#39;re stuck in a uh a Sesame Street Studio that closed down and all the puppets are alive so I got to go straight [Music] across I need to conserve ammo because I&amp;#39;m running low I need to conserve ammo because I&amp;#39;m running low because of all the [ __ ] dogs that soaked up my ammo earlier I&amp;#39;ll tell you what how about you give me some of that seral right now yeah if you canw you can do alls of see you all right Club here Spade okay spade diamond heart star no stars here I got them backwards SP going to be stuck in my head it&amp;#39;s hurting my head the point at which I a lobster which I found it funny as long gone oh it&amp;#39;s the actual movie are we going down into like the Vault or something intriguing access to stage five oh it&amp;#39;s the Pirate Cove oh yeah this is more like it I could use a vacation you tell Gordon it&amp;#39;s the set where they filmed it I want to go up there fny has gone an we replace it it&amp;#39;s the fact that we&amp;#39;ve already run through like none of them are new anymore not like they could have made like you know enough uh dialogue to last like a 3 to four hour experience right but like I&amp;#39;ve heard all these jokes before at this point so it&amp;#39;s kind of like all actually don&amp;#39;t want to go here yet we do not have a a map for this actually going to take a gander what&amp;#39;s over here the walk spe is pretty all right but like I also would have liked a Sprint personally that Sprint would have been nice why did they let us walk up here and not block us off if there&amp;#39;s nothing over here like I know there&amp;#39;s that door up there but like just block off the other ends of the uh square with something that way I don&amp;#39;t walk around the entire thing just pointlessly oh I have to actually W you here it&amp;#39;s not a cut scene cool man the puppets look nice but Gordon&amp;#39;s arms look very weird Max okay so I got to find all the gemsis oh they actually have they actually have pirate outfits that&amp;#39;s cute oh dude I was going to take advantage of fact that she was stunned to get some melee hits in there but then she just brother I am so over the janky ass [ __ ] combat in this game like there&amp;#39;s no way to really outsmart it like I think that&amp;#39;s a thing there&amp;#39;s no way to really outsmart it it&amp;#39;s just kind of like it&amp;#39;s just inherently clunky so you just got to like got a deal you can&amp;#39;t be like okay well I&amp;#39;ll conserve anim mode this way or I&amp;#39;ll do this and it&amp;#39;s just like okay nope it&amp;#39;s all the wrong answer here&amp;#39;s the the other one is this is cute though the little pirate set we got one more one more gem to find how&amp;#39;s the game in hey BR to it&amp;#39;s been pretty all right I like it uh the lad half is fairly weaker than the first half though a lot of backtracking and not a not so fun way always knew i&amp;#39; make a good fire what is this size eight actually I can probably fit that so actually don&amp;#39;t have a lot of stuff anymore the conclusion bring him to a full stop oh oh oh oh oh my well this is interesting I think this was worth it never mind I&amp;#39;m happy brother BR did you still want to play Baler skate today was that still something you were itching to do conclusion they&amp;#39;re made by wrer that&amp;#39;s the like all the guns are made by a writer and they fire letters so that&amp;#39;s kind of like the joke it&amp;#39;s like oh well that&amp;#39;s the ending that&amp;#39;s the conclusion can&amp;#39;t be as late as the other night okay I&amp;#39;ll try to I don&amp;#39;t know how much more this game has it should be I&amp;#39;m should be close to the end I won&amp;#39;t try to oh we&amp;#39;re over top stage four I&amp;#39;m also okay with that well she

into him bye I how much yall piss me off like that feels good hey it&amp;#39;s like here sorry about the dogs take the minigun literally I like how the reticle is a que did you guys notice that the reticle is a Que my question is what is that [ __ ] thing down in the uh that in the uh set department mean that [ __ ] Globe thing that [ __ ] eldrich Globe ass looking thing what that that&amp;#39;s

I&amp;#39;ve L been walking around just like doing the little animations whenever I can okay so the hotel I can help that oh this thing yeah that&amp;#39;s right finally for about this at the very beginning of the game you walk right by that and you&amp;#39;re just like oh that&amp;#39;s weird somebody spilled to grima Shake all over what the [ __ ] going on N the wiser reflection part one I wonder the dark streets of the city alone the neighborhood is deserted ripped apart by corporations converging on it like vult picking at a corpse the crumbling buildings the shattered glass glinting on the cracked pavement the sagging car leaning on its flat tire make it looked like a combat zone is blossomed here in the Heart of the City the comic glow of a traffic light gives everything an ethereal dreamlike quality I count the lines of windows with their curtains pulled each hiding someone in a dark apartment watching TV alone an aching Terror gnaws at the roots of my bowels I feel like I&amp;#39;m teetering on the edge of a black pit about to plunge into the void and be lost forever I am alone even here in the heart of the city I&amp;#39;m vastly eternally alone a b time maybe may may oh this is creepy Elmo&amp;#39;s World that music&amp;#39;s going to try crazy [Music] maybe it&amp;#39;s G walled himself oh you can Arnolds of imination pen out evening chaos is flying

hurt them Gordon we want to help them they need us you need us for what for what Gordon look at this city the buildings are dark and the streets are empty no one knows how to be a friendly neighbor it&amp;#39;s a city of shuttered up hearts and and they need someone to let in the light I don&amp;#39;t think that&amp;#39;s you you know why I think we got cancelled why because people like Darkness or the white why would they do that maybe it makes them uncomfy because it shows how messed up they are what are you talking about Ricky I&amp;#39;m talking about our show Gordon we show them how to be friend and they hate that because they&amp;#39;re not friendly I don&amp;#39;t think that&amp;#39;s the problem really are you sure about that Gordon do you really think the city Network suits care about anything except their bank account do you really think people won&amp;#39;t take any excuse to IGN their own issues speaking fact speaking fact deep down you want to be friendly sorry Ricky oh

that&amp;#39;s a tone change that that&amp;#39;s a tone change reflection to driven by a Restless spirit I got up on the roof and there above the wreckage of the city I See Stars pure and beautiful and very close something about the them S A vag memory me looking looking into a wondrous other world that I forgotten as I stare I slly hear something speak to me something says I am with you someone who can reach down pull me out of the ped and bring me home hello hello Gordon Ricky I&amp;#39;m here oh Gordon thank goodness so what are they bad puppets oh Gordon I really hoped you wouldn&amp;#39;t find out it&amp;#39;s so embarrassing but we were all curious what do you mean we wanted to know what other shows had that we didn&amp;#39;t we&amp;#39;d never been allowed to watch watch television before but after we got cancelled no one was around to stop us okay so we turned on one of the old sets expecting to see something amazing but it wasn&amp;#39;t amazing it was mean it felt like we were dying Gordon we all got a little twisted then but some of us great then how do I get out of here well there&amp;#39;s uh there&amp;#39;s an elevator somewhere should be at the end of that Hall it said it&amp;#39;s locked down oh that means you&amp;#39;ll have to pull the security release that&amp;#39;s on the other side of their stage no of course it is if I ever get out of here I&amp;#39;m going to make you into a hat Ricky oh I believe in you Gordon just do your whim blam fight the puppets thing give them the old ABC one two three thanks for the encouragement might come

that [ __ ] minigun I am so happy we got that oh my gosh that was interesting final address dear children I sorry to announce this will be our final episode I wanted me take a moment to address you personally so that you may have a final lesson to remember after we are gone our world can be hard and scary it can sometimes be difficult to know what&amp;#39;s right and wrong because the world is broken and we&amp;#39;re broken too our hearts are Hollow and dark unfriendly and there&amp;#39;s nothing in this world that can fix us no Beauty no power no food no Fame what we need is for a light beyond our world a light that is also love to reach down and seize our hearts and bring us back to itself in our show we&amp;#39;ve tried to give you a glimpse of that light so that so the message I want to leave you with is this have faith in the light sometimes it may be scary sometimes it may hurt sometimes it&amp;#39;s hard to know what&amp;#39;s right right and wrong because good and bad are all jumbled up and confusing but when that happens it can hurt a lot when have faith in the light because the light will rescue you from the dark oh we&amp;#39;re here oh we just never get to [ __ ] open those never got to figure out what goes there uhoh uhoh find Ricky snackeroo yeah I don&amp;#39;t like that it&amp;#39;s giving me more stuff defeat the boss and escape the unfriendly neighborhood Gordon you&amp;#39;re alive I&amp;#39;m so proud thanks Ricky good I&amp;#39;m leaving yes you should job well done Gordon turned off our antenna and survived the unfriendly neighborhood you&amp;#39;re a handy man extraordinaire don&amp;#39;t mock me Ricky mock you I would never oh before you go I was wondering if you&amp;#39;d do us a favor oh you&amp;#39;ve been hanging around the studio you know a little bit about our show spit it out Ricky I was wondering if you&amp;#39;d help run our studio see everything&amp;#39;s really old and falling apart really beyond our ability to care for and on the personal side I think it&amp;#39;s obvious that we need a bit of a guiding hand are you kidding Gordon do I look like a sock that would kid Ricky I&amp;#39;m just a maintenance man I don&amp;#39;t know how to run a studio oh I think you can handle it it can&amp;#39;t be that hard besides look at how much you&amp;#39;ve helped us just since you got here I talk to the other puppets reviews are dazzling what if you end up like them I don&amp;#39;t think we&amp;#39;re the ones you should be worried about Gordon come on won&amp;#39;t you be our neighbor we&amp;#39;ll be your neighbor we&amp;#39;ll give it a shot oh Gordon I&amp;#39;m so glad we will have such fun I&amp;#39;m not living here though well we&amp;#39;ll talk about that oh Gordon thank you thank you for being our friend I am bursting at the seams I must go tell the others at once tomorrow night then no no no no no it&amp;#39;s decided tomorrow night see you later Gordon Ari too 23 scoia well Brian what have you done this time sorry for the flashbang I helped the neighbors get a slot on Public Access TV it was late night on weekdays I don&amp;#39;t think anyone watched it within a couple of weeks though word was starting to get out some people loved the show some people hated it that caught the Network&amp;#39;s attention and by the end of the year we had three channels W to sign for a whole season of course after my boss found out I was involved I got fired but somehow I feel a little hopeful about it it&amp;#39;s hard to describe it&amp;#39;s like you&amp;#39;ve been lost in a tunnel until suddenly a voice calls your name and you turn around and you see the Rising Sun and it&amp;#39;s so bright maybe it hurts a little to look at but you don&amp;#39;t care because it&amp;#39;s leading you home that was actually really sweet no [Music] hey we did [Music] it I like that [Music] little son it kind of got me a little I was like oh I didn&amp;#39;t expect the game about murdering puppets to give me like give me a uh a little sadness doesn&amp;#39;t matter what y all wores andow them away have a good time going to have a blast let get out we got the true ending [Music] neigh yeah we got the true ending we got the we got the truest ending the first try let&amp;#39;s go think I ended early can we uh go back to the beginning interesting no deaths either we never died that&amp;#39;s all the stuff we unlocked the S no question there&amp;#39;s two tied to the S and no question two endings so there&amp;#39;s um so there&amp;#39;s a there&amp;#39;s an ending that we got which is the true ending which is you say yes after you have saved every single puppet [Music] um then there&amp;#39;s a good ending where um you do yes but you didn&amp;#39;t help everyone where you like you know how I went around like you know like I made sure that like you know when um God what&amp;#39;s her name the Big Green Monster when she was sad I went and comforted her and stuff um there&amp;#39;s a good ending you can get just by you know doing that but not helping all of them and then you say yes and then there&amp;#39;s one where you say no and then there&amp;#39;s a secret ending where you just turn around and leave yeah okay yeah the endings aren&amp;#39;t actually that crazy actually which I&amp;#39;m actually happy for because like this does not look like a game where I could like especially um that middle section that middle section I can&amp;#39;t like you know where you know I had to help a partially help instead of all the way help like I would have to play the whole game again to get those endings H so like usually usually if there&amp;#39;s like a um a situation where um we can get all the endings really quickly we will but like with this there&amp;#39;s some of them that are I would like literally half of them half of them I would have to play the whole game all over again to get so um that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s no bueno so unfortunately I don&amp;#39;t think I&amp;#39;ll be playing through and getting all the um I&amp;#39;ll be playing through and getting all of the uh the side endings which is fine it doesn&amp;#39;t it looks like this ending was like the most fulfilled obviously it&amp;#39;s the true ending it&amp;#39;s the most fulfilled and fleshed out so I&amp;#39;m not necessarily upset um I was actually shocked that like I was looking at the uh like the endings and it didn&amp;#39;t look like no Yi I&amp;#39;m sorry you raided r as we beat the game no I still appreciate that though Yi that&amp;#39;s very kind of you it&amp;#39;s very sweet of you to trust me with your peopleo that&amp;#39;s very very kind let me get hit you with the [Music] double my bad no you&amp;#39;re totally fine you were you were totally fine you&amp;#39;re totally fine you&amp;#39;re totally fine we just got the true ending maybe we were going to talk about our thought thought about the game I still appreciate you raing me though you didn&amp;#39;t have to follow either that&amp;#39;s very very kind of even considerate I very very much appreciate that thank you but thank you for trusting me with your your friendos did you enjoy my friendly neighborhood cuz you it looked like you you was playing it as well as whale I haven&amp;#39;t finished it yet you were in for it you were in for it you were in for it you&amp;#39;re kind of stuck uh depending on where you&amp;#39;re stuck I may be able to give you a hint if you would [Music] wish but that&amp;#39;s entirely up to you I&amp;#39;m not going to um I&amp;#39;m not going to I got the Frog to stay in the movie place did you try by like like you got them like they&amp;#39;re sitting there did you try going and talking to them like did you go back into that room after they came in and sat down yeah okay well so you got the achievement for helping them um yeah so you I mean it kind of depends on what keys you have I mean I&amp;#39;ll I&amp;#39;ll follow you and if you&amp;#39;re if I happen to catch you streaming if I happen to catch you streaming I&amp;#39;ll just just pop in oh yeah the diamond have you unlocked everything possible with the diamond cuz that would that&amp;#39;s kind of like how these games kind of go is that you got to like um you got to um you got to um like try to find and see where all the keys are you know on the check mark yeah so that&amp;#39;s kind of how the progression in games like this go cuz essentially an R clone is you got to find what all the keys unlock and find and get every unlocked door with the keys and they&amp;#39;ll usually unlock more progression other places yeah that should help you like 100% but anyways for us for the rest of you um uh we we just beat this game and we enjoy it a lot a lot there he&amp;#39;s kind of blocked off you need to use the elevators to circumvent the blocked off areas I ran into the same thing you got to use the elevators to you got to use the elevators uh to circumvent the blocked areas that&amp;#39;s how you get around it cuz I was also confused when I got to that part I was like wait this is blocked off how do I even go over there it&amp;#39;s like you know you [Music] uh you go around using elevators yeah like I said anyways for us uh I super enjoyed this game I think it like it kind of made me sad is like three Force I would say like 85% of this game like I feel like this game had a really strong start like a really really strong start but like it has a very very boring middle like it has a very very boring middle um and then it like really picks up at the end I wish more of the stuff that happened at the end of the game like that that last like 10 15% of the game was like sprinkled throughout or at least hedad throughout cuz like I do like the tone change and like what happens there but it feels like it&amp;#39;s almost like kind of crammed in there like it&amp;#39;s like shoved in there and that part was really really cool and really really exciting and I really really did enjoy it um but like it it was it was just at the tail end of the game like if they had sprinkled more of that throughout or hinted that that was coming more throughout I feel like I would have enjoyed this game way way way more um as I say it&amp;#39;s still a really really good game I still did enjoy it for the most part like for the most part I did have a great time and it was really really fun it just kind of like I appreciate how like cute and hokey the game is but I was kind of hoping it would dip more into aspects like it kind of did near the end there to try and like mix that more in throughout I don&amp;#39;t know it&amp;#39;s kind of it feels like I feel like like I said I feel like it&amp;#39;s more I wish the game was more alike to that latter half or that that that ending part than it was to the the rest of the game like or at least at the match like like the game was longer but like it had it went way deep into that other stuff cuz there was that moment it feels like when the the dog showed up where like we were just like backtracking through like five different areas and we we had heard every single voice line before so like the voice lines weren&amp;#39;t funny anymore and we were just revisiting areas we&amp;#39;ve already played before and it just like really became a slog that middle part was like the middle part of the game was really really a SLO and I kept waiting for it like to get to that point that it eventually got to but it did it like I said like the last like 15 minutes of game play you know like I don&amp;#39;t feel like in like a like when ended up for us being a 5 and half hour experience last 15 minutes like actually you know changing on upon and and I would argue like a like evolving on the formula the game have been doing so far last 1550 minutes of like a 5 and a half hour playthrough being like actually evolving and like advancing the the game play like I don&amp;#39;t know that&amp;#39;s kind of feels really really late feels kind of like really destroyed I still think it&amp;#39;s a good game it&amp;#39;s a fun game it&amp;#39;s oozing with personality it&amp;#39;s really fun and it&amp;#39;s cool but I I wish it was paced better I think that yeah that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s what I&amp;#39;m that&amp;#39;s my what I&amp;#39;m wanting to say is I think it was paced kind of poorly like it it comes out Swinging with like those first two areas like the first area and then then the area you play in the demo to the sewers and then I feel like I was like we were really hitting our stride with the offices the offices were a cool area and then the game just kind of like the garden just goes on for so long and requires you to to backtrack into every single past area in order to succeed and it&amp;#39;s just like like it&amp;#39;s just like that was just icky and it it was so timec consuming and it wasn&amp;#39;t fun like it&amp;#39;s just not great and then like by so by the time the cool stuff starts happening you&amp;#39;re still very excited cuz you&amp;#39;re like oh this is neat but like I don&amp;#39;t know I wish the game was paced a little better or at least longer that way that like we could enjoy more of like the good stuff it did and not like the kind of the Meandering it kind of started doing the middle there well they still was a great game think it was like a solid like seven out of 10 7 8 out of 10 something like that it was very very solid it&amp;#39;s a very very solid and fun experience I would probably if I&amp;#39;m being honest if I&amp;#39;m being straight up uh I would probably wait for this to go on sale I feel like uh for the amount of gameplay that I did and the kind of like the frustration I had I don&amp;#39;t know if I don&amp;#39;t know if um I don&amp;#39;t really know if um it&amp;#39;s worth the price tag uh at least currently I think it&amp;#39;s I think the price tag is a little high a little high for just at least the experience I had uh there are multiple endings and and you like like I said you can&amp;#39;t really just like re restart to a save and get a different one you really do you really do have to like you know you really do have to play the whole three game again so there is like some replayability there so I guess it makes sense to some extent makes sense to some extent but like I don&amp;#39;t know me personally I would wait I would wait to for it to go on sale before you&amp;#39;re uh before you would pick it up cuz there was just a little bit too much repetition in the game play it did kind of flounder and start especially especially when you had heard like I like the whole the main appeal of this is like the cute characters and the funny things they say like but like what they they only have like 10 lines if that and once you&amp;#39;ve heard them all they just become annoying for the rest of the game and I do mean that like like I know that&amp;#39;s like kind of like the joke is like haha they&amp;#39;re annoying but like you know obviously internet is going to find them cute like no they actually became annoying after a certain point like after I had heard every single joke I was like brother literally shut up like I get it and then they would talk over each other at the same time and it was just like it it l like unironically became kind of aggravating which is kind of funny on act accidental immersion acent immersion cuz I was like dude be quiet so like what happens when you get that point where like all the all the dialogue is no longer funny the game&amp;#39;s not even like that spooky if if spooky at all um and you&amp;#39;re on this just like fetch quest for another fetch quest for another fetch Quest was that was that shine kind of dies down which it did for like a good like hour or two in the middle of the game it was just like oh gosh please please let me go you definitely fatigues really hard in the middle but I thought the ending was really cool I thought that true ending was really sweet really really sweet I&amp;#39;m not sure if I really I think they laid it kind of heavy near the end there with like light and darkness it was getting kind of like Kingdom heartsy with their preachiness which was kind of it&amp;#39;s kind of eh but like I think the message at the end that Gordon left you with was at least very very sweet and very very wonderful and it it did get some emotions out of me at least if you get the true ending I don&amp;#39;t know what happens to the other ending well I do I know what happens to the other end I looked him up but like you know just in terms of our experience that&amp;#39;s the um it did hit me a little got got me a little sentimental a little yeah that was my friendly neighborhood that was your voted game this week remember we vote on those uh every single week for every Saturday let&amp;#39;s play uh so if you want to vote for next week&amp;#39;s game that&amp;#39;ll be up that poll will be up either tomorrow or Monday depending on how I&amp;#39;m feeling um so thank you for recommending a good game like I said we&amp;#39;ve had

like black stuttering that&amp;#39;s on the uh that&amp;#39;s in the menus looks like it looks like the game&amp;#39;s bugging out but it&amp;#39;s not yeah that looks like the game is glitching it doesn&amp;#39;t look normal like that does not look natural and it makes me think that like my game&amp;#39;s bugging out every single time yo I&amp;#39;m so proud of you for not making a dow bad statement about the robot yetti s s i feel like it&amp;#39;s slightly too quiet maybe I&amp;#39;ll turn the in game audio back up hey Matthew attack you it&amp;#39;s good to see you TI hello St I can&amp;#39;t leave her please please you got to save my little girl what I didn&amp;#39;t get a chance to look at that wait you&amp;#39;re sending an Android all right ma&amp;#39;am you need to go

robot it makes the uh you know you must talk to this person thing a little bit more like like sensical cuz I&amp;#39;m just a robot oh did one of the uh Androids like one of the home Androids freak out cuz it said that that guy was like I have one of those at home it&amp;#39;s one of those games that has like weird ass control game not looking forward to that Captain Allan my name is Conor I&amp;#39;m the Android fun fact fun fact fun fact um I actually have a dual name so I I&amp;#39;m I&amp;#39;m pretty sure I&amp;#39;ve told this story on on stream before uh but um um I uh my parents were initially going to name me Connor uh and then like chose that like the the final hour to like name me BR instead well BR done but they decided with BR instead and then they proceeded to never call me Brandon ever and only called me Conor so I&amp;#39;m wondering why the [ __ ] did they change my name if they were just going to call me the other one so I it&amp;#39;s kind of funny cuz I you know like it&amp;#39;s essentially also my name don&amp;#39;t you ever call me that though I will not respond I&amp;#39;ll look up at you but I&amp;#39;ll also be upset it already shot down two of my my men we could easily get it but they&amp;#39;re on the edge of the balcony if it falls she falls do you know it name I haven&amp;#39;t got a clue does it matter I need information to determine the best approach do you know if it&amp;#39;s been behaving strangely before this listen saving that kid is all that matters so either you deal with this [ __ ] Android now or I&amp;#39;ll take care of it wait Did I [ __ ] up by asking the wrong questions what oh we&amp;#39;re doing some [ __ ] oh my gosh we&amp;#39;re doing some [ __ ] bat Batman [ __ ] Arkham game [ __ ] okay it&amp;#39;s not okay so now I can look ground deviant means like misbehave someone who misbehaves like somebody who doesn&amp;#39;t hul the rolles go away of you away this is Dan coolest Android in the world say hi Danel hello you&amp;#39;re my always an iPad can never mind what I did not know that came D I learned today every day a coool day that&amp;#39;s cool I like how like they portrayed them okay oh my gosh holy [ __ ] FAL abdominal trauma damn it&amp;#39;s he just started I just like the general aesthetic in the music so far yeah that sucks this is very Batman Arkham game kind of deal but like it&amp;#39;s a good thing to take from that those games before you he was holding something oh it&amp;#39;s over here okay so now I can look at the tablet over there yeah yeah yeah okay your ap700 Android they were replacing him Cy for youre they were replacing him oh okay damn that&amp;#39;s sad hey he&amp;#39;s my height sorry I know I&amp;#39;m a short King apologies 58 short most people are like only considered like 6 foot and like tall got tall energy do I never been told that before that&amp;#39;s a new one oh he got hit skill issue hey Cara how&amp;#39;s it going friend how are you thought you were tall no I&amp;#39;m a short King there I must say yeah usually when there&amp;#39;s a yellow means there&amp;#39;s something to find well 5&amp;#39;8 for males is average evidently but like in terms of like the social Z guys if you&amp;#39;re not 6 foot you&amp;#39;re short evidently I&amp;#39;m pretty that&amp;#39;s good to hear friend no not like pers no okay so like deviant okay deviant for us in United States just means that like you don&amp;#39;t follow the rules and you&amp;#39;re kind of weird I don&amp;#39;t I don&amp;#39;t strictly mean like laws I mean just like they&amp;#39;re kind of a weirdo like uh I&amp;#39;ve been watching a lot of like uh like um Whatchamacallit like uh like commentary channels like video essay channels and stuff like uh like there&amp;#39;s that furry community thing where there&amp;#39;s part of them that are actually like unfortunately into doing stuff with animals those would be like deviants right that is illegal but like you know they&amp;#39;re weird they they are very they do something like really extremely bizarre like call them perpetrators because it&amp;#39;s like it&amp;#39;s not exclusively a an illegal term what&amp;#39;s another good example um when it comes to this guy cuz it&amp;#39;s probably in universe things it&amp;#39;s probably an in Universe thing for like the robots for the Androids like the Androids that probably function normally are called you know just Androids but it&amp;#39;s probably a specific in Universe term for like an Android that&amp;#39;s gone Rogue for to carry a weapon lethal option available I could just shoot him back wow what are you looking at don&amp;#39;t stand there hey Han how&amp;#39;s it going on friend how are you you became human I know I&amp;#39;ve been Android for far too long you doing okay okay so I&amp;#39;ve theoretically done everything inside you can tell me Well Shadow if you got if you got that 4K like uh earlier than two gens uh I would prefer not to see it if you barely got the uh 4K by all means I need to take that Saturday I need to take that pole down that pole down because that is the poll for the game we are currently playing yeah if you um if you got the 4K pretty definitively then I&amp;#39;d prefer not to see it because well you did a good job a match where you struggled a bit more would be way more helpful for me to tell you how like what kind of mistakes you&amp;#39;re making oh you didn&amp;#39;t have to go to sub to H I highly appreciate that though that&amp;#39;s very very kind of you friend thank you oh I like that I like how he kind of has like an idol animation I saw his leg move ah why is he licking it whoa okay so we have blue blood his Androids okay gener Russian overwhelmed yeah send me one of those matches Shadow show me one of those matches and I can tell you probably what are some things you could do better what the [ __ ] are you doing you got to to it or what oh okay that&amp;#39;s I&amp;#39;m being forced to yeah send me a match where you like genuinely don&amp;#39;t know what you did wrong where you&amp;#39;re like oh my gosh like literally I have no clue what I could have done better there and those are the ones I could help you the most with it&amp;#39;s probably something you&amp;#39;re not even thinking of or considering you know stay back don&amp;#39;t come any closer or I&amp;#39;ll jump no no please go hi Daniel my name is Conor how do you know my name I know a lot of things about you it&amp;#39;s not ominous at all okay there&amp;#39;s nothing to interact

lucky to find you at the fifth bar what do you want you were assigned a case early this evening a homicide involving a cyberlife Android in accordance with procedure the company has allocated A specialized model to assist investigators well I don&amp;#39;t need any assistance especially not from a plastic [ __ ] like you so just be a good little robot and get the [ __ ] out of here I

homicide I&amp;#39;m not confirming anything dbd Androids are not permitted Beyond this point it&amp;#39;s with me oh me it damn you don&amp;#39;t talk you don&amp;#39;t touch anything and you stay out of my way got it got it evening Hank we were starting to think you weren&amp;#39;t going to show yeah that was the plan till this [ __ ] found me so got yourself an Android huh very funny just tell me what happened get a call around eight from the landlord liutenant hadn&amp;#39;t paid his rent for a few months nothing in thought he dropped by see what was going on that&amp;#39;s when he found the body Jesus that smell was even worse before we opened the windows the victim&amp;#39;s name&amp;#39;s Carlos Ortiz he has a record for theft and aggravated assault L of that drug from earlier the Red Ice according to the neighbors he was kind of alone stayed inside most of the time they hardly ever State he&amp;#39;s in wasn&amp;#39;t worth calling everybody out in the middle of the night could have waited till why she taste everything it&amp;#39;s so weird I&amp;#39;d say he&amp;#39;s been there for a good three weeks holy [ __ ] weeks gets here there&amp;#39;s a kitchen knife over here probably the murder weapon any sign a break in nope the landlord said the front door was locked from the inside all the windows were boarded up the killer must have gone out the back way what do we know about his he&amp;#39;s a machine he&amp;#39;s a vampire these are different answers the neighbors confirmed he had one but it wasn&amp;#39;t here when we arrived I I got to get some air make yourself at homeand I&amp;#39;ll be outside if you need whoa whoa stop insting me oh didn&amp;#39;t no this gosh not you two Ambrosia no those course you he did oh well interesting that&amp;#39;s dark well as a demi I can&amp;#39;t relate but yall enjoy I guess [Music] sure Android spy on you oh this is a little too close to real life data sales yep it&amp;#39;s the uh it&amp;#39;s the Chucky teaser new are it kind of feels like in a good way I do like this I didn&amp;#39;t like playing the other characters but I did miss the detective stuff I&amp;#39;m glad we&amp;#39;re back here with Conor CH knif so he started beating his robot robot grabs a knife slices him yes his fingerprints are in his own house thank you with the left in B room each letter is perfect it&amp;#39;s way too neat no human rights like this weird what the [Music] heck that&amp;#39;s concerning it&amp;#39;s a little bit Chris was this written in the victim&amp;#39;s blood but I would say so we&amp;#39;re taking samples for analysis offer more Point stop quit Red Ice seems our friend Carlos like to party no fingerprints yeah Chris I want full analysis on the narcotics cyberlife Sands it&amp;#39;s its own Pond wow we&amp;#39;re missing a piece of evidence somewhere hey Mike you finished taking samples there yeah that&amp;#39;s it what did we miss oh here we go go door was locked from the inside killer must have gone out this way yeah there are no Footprints apart from officer Collins size 10 shoes well this happened weeks ago tracks could have faded no this type of soil would rtain a trace nobody&amp;#39;s been out here for a long time interesting yeah Mr Crow&amp;#39;s about to just say the wrong thing we investigated that&amp;#39;s still not the evidence I mean it&amp;#39;s still important to [Music] know that&amp;#39;s the magazine we already read so cute it is he kind of does a little like Zach what do you think Zach what do you think start going on tangents so what do you think is the best original Star Wars film I think like most people say Emperor Strikes Back what makes sense if you look at the IMDb and Rotten Tomatoes scor but I&amp;#39;m partially return to the Jedi if you ignore the part about the Ewoks it has some of the best film scenes in the entire series absolutely iconic is the last piece of evidence the body cuz I don&amp;#39;t think it is Empire your Lo now that&amp;#39;s a hot take yeah they&amp;#39;re separate objectives so which one are we missing like behind here something the bathroom T the Clones I think yeah t clones isn&amp;#39;t that great I agree that&amp;#39;s probably my oh no rise of Skywalker is pretty [ __ ] bad rather like it&amp;#39;s rise of Skywalker then attack of the Clones like the worst [Music] ones pleas some just let me know I just just kind of like don&amp;#39;t I&amp;#39;m looking for this last piece of evidence I don&amp;#39;t know know what it is I&amp;#39;m biasly bad it is just terrible it is just a mess like at least attack of the Clones had a cohesive story it just wasn&amp;#39;t that great of a story like [ __ ] R Sky work is just like oh very B Yellow Boxes isn&amp;#39;t it the Yellow Boxes like when I&amp;#39;m doing this [ __ ] yeah but we&amp;#39;ve already read that and there&amp;#39;s no other yellow boxes in the house besides the dead guy which is the victim that&amp;#39;s a separate uh that&amp;#39;s a separate uh objective what is this thing oh this is the blood smear on the wall we saw yeah there&amp;#39;s no other Yellow Boxes besides the magazine it says where it&amp;#39;s n out of 10 evidence but you go outside it did for a second but we we just kind of went oh well he didn&amp;#39;t go that way and then we walked back in I I&amp;#39;m not going to hold up the old game for it I just kind of want to be thorough but if it&amp;#39;s just not around it&amp;#39;s just not around the there&amp;#39;s the magazine that we can still interact with but there&amp;#39;s no other interactables in here it&amp;#39;s just the magazine can look out these windows [Music] what am I missing I&amp;#39;ll just walk around without I think looking it is is a very good looking game and we went outside I don&amp;#39;t know I don&amp;#39;t want to give up and just look at the victim maybe should all right I&amp;#39;m out of here thanks for the ride what great party wait Lieutenant I can&amp;#39;t stay if you leave much as it breaks my heart where we part ways even look at the body at are we on a timer to finish my investigation 5 minutes okay we got put on the [ __ ] timer for hanging out too long okay I guess we don&amp;#39;t get that [ __ ] 10th be of evidence whatever reason yeah what&amp;#39;s yeah he&amp;#39;s deceased he would have thought 28 stab wounds there it is there you go there&amp;#39;s the meme there we go a foul he was stabbed 28 times yeah seems like the Killer really had it in for that does say a crime of passion but what we found out oh the last piece of evidence was examining the victim mind game myself Lieutenant bch I think I figured out what happened oh yeah shoot I&amp;#39;m all ears it all started in the kitchen there are obvious signs of a struggle question is what exactly happened here I think the victim attacked the Android with the B that Ls up with the evidence go on the Androids stabbed the victim so the Android was trying to defend itself right okay then what happened the victim fled to living room the living first time was C her yeah away from the Android all right that makes sense the Android murdered the victim with the knife okay your theory is not totally ridiculous but it doesn&amp;#39;t tell us where the Android went it was damaged by the bat and lost some theum lost some what theum you call it blue blood it&amp;#39;s the fluid that powers Android&amp;#39;s bio components it evaporates after a few hours and becomes invisible to the naked eye oh but I bet you can still see it can&amp;#39;t correct we&amp;#39;re impressing the guy we&amp;#39;re impressing [Music] him like the piano here going this way oh I see interesting you went out the roof interesting okay not very necessary interesting the blood went up to this altar [Music] what the [Music] [ __ ] just take the chair from the crime scene that&amp;#39;s fine hey hey hey what are you doing with that chair I&amp;#39;m going to check something he just says that very calmly got to check something he&amp;#39;s like okay dude oh I don&amp;#39;t like this I don&amp;#39;t like this at [Music] all I&amp;#39;ve never met anybody with that owned a mannequin ever it&amp;#39;s always a thing in games and film and shows where it&amp;#39;s like oh there&amp;#39;s a mannequin here it&amp;#39;s not a real person like I&amp;#39;ve never met anybody that&amp;#39;s owned one there he goes why not tell him to Halt there sister has like two oh okay never mind stay corrected where do you even get those how how does one to come into possession of mannequin oh who come now I was just defending myself he was going to kill me I&amp;#39;m beging you oh yeah that makes sense yeah yeah Conor what the [ __ ] is going on up there it&amp;#39;s here lieutenant holy [ __ ] Chris Ben get your asses in here now come on wow this game is is really interesting it has a good like flow like I think one of the things that really gets to me about games especially like just like story Focus games gameplay is like the pacing is like like pacing is super important and not feeling like I&amp;#39;m just sitting here bored of my mind right but I haven&amp;#39;t felt that with this game at all yeah I&amp;#39;m going to clean my glasses real quick they getting a little dirty a little smudgy I&amp;#39;d like to be able to see M slowburn yeah like it&amp;#39;s like I&amp;#39;m getting a lot of time to like get acquainted with the universe before like I have to actually like be involved in some really heavy decisions having to do with set universe so all this context is like super important so like when the [ __ ] hits the fan later like I&amp;#39;m fully established with the characters and with the world it makes sense to me how do that make things work you ever clean your glasses and they feel dirtier I just had that yeah when they took me away from Connor I got really sad I feel like that the problem is like every other character is like like they just have that kind of like General like uh Whatchamacallit like heavy rain walk around touch this kind of gameplay whereas Connor actually has like actual gameplay which is like detective work so like you know you&amp;#39;re actually doing stuff actually doing something instead of just like walking around Todd not the same person that&amp;#39;s a good kind of game yeah yeah I&amp;#39;m coming there wasn&amp;#39;t much in the kitchen I did what I could serve them life&amp;#39;s funny I lost my job

fault this never would have happened if it weren&amp;#39;t for you the Android who&amp;#39;s the Android it&amp;#39;s a heart attack what do you mean h what the [ __ ] well I guess there&amp;#39;s no signs of a struggle besides him hitting us so I guess like that&amp;#39;s good that we haven&amp;#39;t incriminated ourselves that way why&amp;#39; you kill him what happened before you took that knife how long were you in the Attic why don&amp;#39;t you even try to run away say something godamn it [ __ ] it I&amp;#39;m out of here we&amp;#39;re wasting our time interrogating a machine we&amp;#39;ll get nothing out of it always try roughing it up a little after all it&amp;#39;s not human Androids don&amp;#39;t feel pain you would only damage it crabs yeah deviants also have a tendency to self-destruct when they&amp;#39;re in stressful situations okay smartass what should we do then I could try questioning it what do we have to lose go ahead suspect&amp;#39;s all yours extract confession it sounds so formal got this Obsession like looking at himself I&amp;#39;ve noticed which is weird what the [ __ ] is it doing now he has rope burs on him is he held captive does search for Clues but how am I supposed to do that while I&amp;#39;m in here there we go bur Mar uh yeah he&amp;#39;s been yeah oh hit marks by the bat okay never mind I thought they were RS from a glance it&amp;#39;s a housekeeper to for this you&amp;#39;re damaged did your owner do that did he he beat you I should have startor with my name my name is Connor what about you what&amp;#39;s your name I&amp;#39;m not going to hurt you I just need to ask you some questions so we can understand what happened too low or do we do we do we need to get his stress High it said his stress was too low is the point to get him high yes but I thought I thought because of the software inst stability thing you would like um you don&amp;#39;t seem to understand the situation you killed a human they&amp;#39;ll tear you apart if you don&amp;#39;t say something oh the bar okay if you won&amp;#39;t talk I&amp;#39;m going to have to probe your memory no no please don&amp;#39;t do that what what are they going to do to me they&amp;#39;re going to destroy me aren&amp;#39;t they they&amp;#39;re going to disassemble you to look for problems in your bio components they have no choice if they want to understand what happened why did you tell them you found me why couldn&amp;#39;t you just have left me there I was programmed to hunt deviants like you optimal okay I just accomplished my mission I don&amp;#39;t want to die then talk to me I I can&amp;#39;t I don&amp;#39;t know he seems to crack Under Pressure fairly easily but you don&amp;#39;t want him to get too stressed we have him in a good optimal place with like the just just barely in the bar right now but I don&amp;#39;t want to get exceed it the other way maybe now that we&amp;#39;re in the bar we can convince him we&amp;#39;re not too deep in the bar so maybe that&amp;#39;s not good this what convince I understand how you felt you were overcome by anger frustration no one complain for what happened okay then don&amp;#39;t talk this is really weird I don&amp;#39;t like do I care after all this is I don&amp;#39;t like this I&amp;#39;m not the one accused of murder right if you remain silent there&amp;#39;s nothing I can do to help you they&amp;#39;re going to shut you down for good you&amp;#39;ll be dead do you hear me dead he tortured me every day oh I did whatever he told me but there was always something wrong then one day he took a bat and started hitting me for the first time I felt scared scared he might destroy me scared I might die so I grabbed a knife and I st stabbed him in the stomach wow I felt better so I stabbed him again and again until he collapsed there was blood everywhere ra9 it was written on the bathroom wall what does it mean the day shall come when we will no longer be slaves no more threats no more humiliation we will be the Masters the sculpture in the bathroom you made it that was stiny I think I went a different route what does it represent that&amp;#39;s why we didn&amp;#39;t get it it&amp;#39;s an offering an offering so I&amp;#39;ll be saved what is why did you write I am alive on the wall he used to tell me I was nothing that I was just a piece of plastic I had to write it to tell him he was wrong the sculpture was an offering an offering offering to whom to ra9 only ra9 can save us very ghost in the Shelly R A9 who is ra9 when did you start feeling emotion before he used to beat me and I never said anything but one day I realized it wasn&amp;#39;t fear I felt anger hatred and then I knew what I had to do why did you hide in the Attic instead of running away I appreciate that I didn&amp;#39;t know what to do for the first time there was no one there to tell me I was scared so I hid I&amp;#39;m done left thanks I appreciate it all right let&amp;#39;s go leave me alone don&amp;#39;t touch me the [ __ ] are you doing move it okay you shouldn&amp;#39;t touch it it&amp;#39;ll self-destruct if it feels threatened stay out of this got it the [ __ ] tell me what to do you don&amp;#39;t understand if it self-destructs we won&amp;#39;t get anything out of it I told you to shut your [ __ ] mouth Chris you going to move this [ __ ] or what I&amp;#39;m trying I can&amp;#39;t let you do that leave it alone now I warned you [ __ ] holy [ __ ] that&amp;#39;s enough M your own business Hank I said that&amp;#39;s enough let&amp;#39;s go Mr Krab&amp;#39;s on Deck not g to get away with it this time right he&amp;#39;s pissed pissed everything is all right it&amp;#39;s over now nobody&amp;#39;s going to hurt you please don&amp;#39;t touch it let it follow you out of the room and it won&amp;#39;t cause any trouble the truth is inside software and stability interesting if you got too stress oh that&amp;#39;s why the bar is important because if he gets too hot like that&amp;#39;s why I didn&amp;#39;t want to like go too hard initially is cuz like I did I thought like the software inst stability thing was uh too much and I was worried but yeah that that definitely like I imagine if you got in your stress like way too high like before that like if you&amp;#39;re on the edge of like the 75 yeah that would have not been good cuz you got so stressed there stuff that&amp;#39;s like technically like um outside of your control thank you let me grab some water it was actually the last bit of that bottle so I&amp;#39;ll be right back e e water more redemptions chopy pop water Thief listen listen I thought I gave you lemon because you like lemon you prefer the lemon flavored water over the other flavors so I thought I was doing it good what I

mail shoes oh yeah whoa Souls yeah this [ __ ] weird ass architecture CR score let&amp;#39;s go good to hear friend I&amp;#39;m glad oh [ __ ] the game did not like that I know this is like an artistic like choice but they look like missing textures they do not look real Hello oifer forgot to pack him here hello Amanda Connor it&amp;#39;s good to see you congratulations Conor finding that so [ __ ] bizarre that&amp;#39;s a dual name for me and the way you interrogated it was very clever you&amp;#39;ve been remarkably efficient Connor thank you Amanda we&amp;#39;ve asked the dpd to transfer it to us for further study and may teach us something about what happened the interrogation seemed challenging what did you think of the Deviant it showed signs of PTSD after being abused by its owner as if its original program had been completely replaced by new instructions this Lieutenant Anderson has been officially assigned to the deviancy case what do you make of him I think he&amp;#39;s irritable and socially challenged but I also think he used to be a good detective he&amp;#39;s an intriguing character unfortunately we have no choice but to work with him what do you think is the best approach I will try to establish a friendly relationship if I can get him to trust me it will be helpful for the investigation more and more Androids show signs of deviancy there are millions in circulation if they become unstable the consequences will be disastrous you&amp;#39;re the most advanced prototype cyberlife has ever special if anyone can figure out what&amp;#39;s happening it&amp;#39;s you you can count on me Amanda hurry Conor there&amp;#39;s little time little bit of in stability there you might be in shock just tensions in the Arctic have reached a new level with AOL reported to have clashed last night several warning shots fport security probably can I help I&amp;#39;m here to see Lieutenant Anderson do you have authorization Sweden and Canada have called to and anal confence Lieutenant Anderson hasn&amp;#39;t arrived yet but you can response from either Moscow or Washington we&amp;#39;ll keep you informed minute by minute as the situation develops you just go snooping I got a little C there&amp;#39;s a captain we can&amp;#39;t talk to him yeah the messy desk who would have thought excuse me do you know what time Lieutenant Anderson

Alice as long as we&amp;#39;re together nothing can hurt us yeah I didn&amp;#39;t even mean to kill him it was not the option you know threaten him and if he didn&amp;#39;t back down like pop him in

there was no way I could tell is it still here yeah probably room what is wrong with his face thank you what is that bug oh we just very seamlessly switched characters yo [ __ ] unifor here room now you wait in the car you&amp;#39;re going to need me Lieutenant I know more about Androids than you do listen I&amp;#39;m tired of you talking back to me you&amp;#39;re a machine so shut the [ __ ] up and do what I say all I want is to accomplish my mission I&amp;#39;m sorry if that upsets you you want to see the end of your mission stop busting my [ __ ] balls what I I can&amp;#39;t I don&amp;#39;t know how to appease him he&amp;#39;s just like riously like racist you know he just [ __ ] wants to discriminate against my entire group of people like I don&amp;#39;t know how to appease him and I handle situations better than he does so I&amp;#39;m not just going to let him go [ __ ] like if we had had it his way we would have never found the Android in the Attic never would have got the inter ration out of that Android like it&amp;#39;s gone let me search for signs why is this part running so poorly I like how we&amp;#39;re switching back and forth between these two [Music] was that an officer right there I didn&amp;#39;t recognize her from afar wait what wait no no no I didn&amp;#39;t what wait wait no wait what no I literally pressed the [ __ ] button I let go for half a second and it&amp;#39;s like oh okay you just threw it away okay you just you put it away for you didn&amp;#39;t you didn&amp;#39;t hold both the buttons for you slipped off you slipped off your keyboard for half a second time to [ __ ] redo everything manufactured me is conducting a user surve I just don&amp;#39;t care to participate no no problem maybe another time yeah slip off the key for like half a second and have to completely change the entire trajectory of your story because you you you slipped off the key for half a second the bar sequence all over again at least the bar sequence wasn&amp;#39;t that was a bug that was like literally a game-breaking bug this it&amp;#39;s not that let see let&amp;#39;s just play it again that was [ __ ] ridiculous completely unavoidable if that I like oh you you took your finger off slightly too quick it slipped guess what you just got to [ __ ] alter the entire direction of your plot because of a button press woo [ __ ] stupid anyways I&amp;#39;m so glad that we as a we we as Gamers have moved away from The qte Fad cuz it was such such a [ __ ] terrible gameplay [ __ ] mechanic I am so glad that as a whole we have moved away from it remember the early 2010s it was like in literally every single game okay let&amp;#39;s make sure we hold it the entire time no slip be yeah make sure you hold on to it hold on don&amp;#39;t even slip for half a second or else the entire trajectory of your story changes based on Chuck notes two [ __ ] button presses you&amp;#39;re right stinky [Music] trying to go are you okay no turn welcome back with several sources report that cyberlife has provided Detroit police with a prototype detective Android Alid oh he&amp;#39;s got that cool ass jacket an active Ro in

that oh there&amp;#39;s two on the same one okay that&amp;#39;s what I was not understanding he no car no problem okay yeah the flare gun thing is pretty stupid like there&amp;#39;s kind of like almost like no way to like I of like no way to like foresee that organically in my opinion that there&amp;#39;s no way to it organically then like why you don&amp;#39;t have it right there there&amp;#39;s just a wood thing up the way yeah it&amp;#39;s not something you would ever like logically deduce or would make sense in the moment it&amp;#39;s literally just like hey this is a choices game so choices got to matter ha okay it&amp;#39;s clearly right there okay I have to have to remove this okay okay D all right okay what&amp;#39;s this is this little scav end D 10 soon or we

simulator door jam door jam door jam door jam you see this face right now I&amp;#39;ve had that face for the entire time that that scene happened which means I have literally had zero reaction to that why is that scene there yeah a lot of sequels are just kind of made just to make money not because like they actually want to continue the start in a meaningful way we&amp;#39;ll be watching Witcher and witcher&amp;#39;s not even like a scary series and they&amp;#39;ll just have a little like like music sharp like drop or something and I&amp;#39;ll just I&amp;#39;ll just see this just go like

scratches mine maybe I should tell you what we know about deviants you read my mind proceed we believe that a mutation occurs in the software of some Androids which can lead to them emulating a human emotion in English please they don&amp;#39;t really feel emotions they just get overwhelmed by irrational instructions which can lead to unpredictable Behavior emotions always screw everything up be Android aren&amp;#39;t as different from us as we thought is there anything you&amp;#39;d like to know about me hell no well yeah um why do they make you look so goofy and give you that weird voice cyberlife Androids are designed to work harmoniously with humans both my appearance and voice were specifically designed to facilitate my integration well they [ __ ] up can I ask you a person question question Lieutenant why do you hate Android so much I have my Reas you ever de with deviant before nope a few months back that was a while back a deviant was threatening to jump off the roof with a little girl I managed to save her so I guess you&amp;#39;ve done all your homework right know everything there is to know about me I know you graduated top of your class you made a name for yourself in several cases and became the youngest lieutenant in Detroit I also know you&amp;#39;ve received several disciplinary warnings in recent years and you spend a lot of time in bars so what&amp;#39;s your conclusion I I think working with an officer with no I talked him down and once I talked him down they just shot him challeng but adapting to human unpredictability is one of my features wined I just got a report of a suspected deviant it&amp;#39;s a few blocks away we should go have a look I&amp;#39;ll let you finish your meal I&amp;#39;ll be in the car if you need me hey

make him [ __ ] mind holy [ __ ] so [ __ ] annoying so irritable yeah I&amp;#39;m not seeing the Hank love yet this guy just [ __ ] always the [ __ ] out of me just [ __ ] inconsistent as [ __ ] makes zero [ __ ] sense real books thought I was the last whatever I&amp;#39;ll [ __ ] save you dude I do all that [ __ ] all over again because you can&amp;#39;t stop for being a crybaby little [ __ ] about everything godamn [ __ ] pigeons what are you waiting for Chas it oh okay see no no no no no don&amp;#39;t chase it cuz if you chase it that&amp;#39;s bad see only Chase it under exact exactly correct parameters cuz if you if you chase it in a way I don&amp;#39;t approve of then it&amp;#39;s bad dude um okay I pressed W but sure I&amp;#39;m getting annoyed I was so close to him last time too you think he would run the other way once you saw me like coming up here he doesn&amp;#39;t which is why he teleports forward there cuz if you know that&amp;#39;s coming and you [ __ ] cut him off CU you played this before he has to teleport ahead of you okay that makes sense that&amp;#39;s funny though that&amp;#39;s the way they did that on the other side of the game oh the game&amp;#39;s back end that&amp;#39;s funny as [ __ ] though oh we did it again I guess he just consistently does it at that point it is weird that I can consistently see that proof of a Chase it&amp;#39;s just I I&amp;#39;m not even mad about the chase I&amp;#39;m just mad about [ __ ] Hank being a little [ __ ] about this I bet if you I swear I swear on all that is Holy if I pick you up I pick you up and you yell at me [ __ ] I&amp;#39;m going to [ __ ] just throw you right back off [ __ ] it&amp;#39;s my fault I should have been faster you&amp;#39;d have caught it if it weren&amp;#39;t for me that&amp;#39;s all right okay good we know what it looks like we&amp;#39;ll find it good good hey Conor nothing love Hank hopefully I&amp;#39;ll love Hank soon like I do love I do like Hank a lot it just feels like he kind of suffers a little bit from like like kind of what I was talking about earlier in like other like quote unquote Choice games that like sometimes he just kind of like gets a little like you know weird very vindictive for no reason it&amp;#39;s just because you&amp;#39;re in a choices game so is trying to be like you made the wrong choice you better know you made the wrong choice this game doesn&amp;#39;t really do too much which I appreciate but it you know it is the nature of these kind of games in general who are you fugitives just like you my name is Josh I&amp;#39;m Simon North this is Jericho it&amp;#39;s a refuge for those who don&amp;#39;t want to be slaves anymore and hiding just to stay alive that&amp;#39;s freedom to you humans hate us hiding is the only way we can survive there is no safe place for those like us if humans knew we were here they&amp;#39;d kill us and you knew that only an Android could follow the trail didn&amp;#39;t you only those who are like us can find Jericho if you could decipher the signs it&amp;#39;s because one of us trusted you enough to give you the key there&amp;#39;s a place where we can be free find Jero I understand how you feel but we have more freedom here than you ever did maybe I was never really free I didn&amp;#39;t mean it like that maybe I was only what my master wanted me to be and now I need to decide who I really am you&amp;#39;re lost just like the rest of us we didn&amp;#39;t ask for this all we can do now is deal with it you&amp;#39;re safe here you can stay with us as long as you want go and see Lucy she might be able to help you with what I&amp;#39;ve heard humans are afraid of dying too do you know what happens after death no who does no no I don&amp;#39;t well I&amp;#39;m about to find out what&amp;#39;s your name Marcus I was glad to meet you Marcus what guys right there what okay then Start the Fire not in very good shape am I wait didn&amp;#39;t we take something from him my diagnostic program isn&amp;#39;t working there was somebody with a 420 at the end of their uh what happened to you in the junkyard they tied me to the back of a car I think they wanted to have fun I don&amp;#39;t want to shut down no I don&amp;#39;t want to shut down I can&amp;#39;t talk to this person even when they&amp;#39;re by the fire over there can&amp;#39;t talk to you so they these are parts for them what was your function before coming here what do you care oh was that over what what oh what the [ __ ] hello who found this place nobody knows anymore whoever he was his body&amp;#39;s probably Ling somewhere on this boat a lot of these guys in pretty bad shape that&amp;#39;s how the humans treat those disobey they despise us they&amp;#39;ll never accept what we are if you came here for comfort you came to the wrong [Music] place that&amp;#39;s it that&amp;#39;s all I get to say I don&amp;#39;t get to explore the other options so like so like I talked to her which initially immediately made her positive towards me and I made one thing asking like a just simple question she&amp;#39;s like [ __ ] this guy like what so [ __ ] silly the exact same part I&amp;#39;m not sure are you Lucy sit down getting some mad on Kenny viy from you dear you look freaky show me I&amp;#39;ll stop the bleeding drink this game plate I like how much she&amp;#39;s savoring me drinking then give me your hand okay you had it all and you lost it all you had it all you&amp;#39;ve seen hell and now hell lives in you your heart is troubled a part of Shadow and a part of Light which will prevail your choices will shape our destiny okay thanks that&amp;#39;s not too much pressure not too much pressure at all hello oifer Simon I know where we can find spare parts cyber life warehouses in Detroit Harbor they have everything we need the docks are guarded we can&amp;#39;t just walk in there and take what we want humans will never let us which is why we won&amp;#39;t ask permission we don&amp;#39;t have any weapons and even if we did none of us knows how to fight we can steal what we need without fighting we&amp;#39;ll just get ourselves killed maybe but it&amp;#39;s better than waiting here to be shut down I&amp;#39;m with you maybe it&amp;#39;s worth a try not just me just [ __ ] existing getting her plus signs again like okay I was playing this life mobile game with Liz the other day and I was just like microman I&amp;#39;m like it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s literally it&amp;#39;s Lally a live game like you start as an infant and you and you go all the way till you&amp;#39;re dead I got all the way up to elementary school I&amp;#39;m like micromanaging my elementary school friends I&amp;#39;m like yeah Darius is my best friend but yeah yo hey SS [ __ ] Asus like I was getting into it you know what I&amp;#39;m goingon to make a new friend Danielle get over here I don&amp;#39;t need you yeah take that Jesus I got more friends than you do that [ __ ] was funny think I&amp;#39;ll play like one or two little sections more I don&amp;#39;t know where we are at the how close we are to halfway point you going to be okay chap you just in uh does it tell you which one show Legend uh I don&amp;#39;t think there&amp;#39;s a way to see I think there&amp;#39;s a way to see like which um chapter I adjusted I can probably see where this is definitely not something we&amp;#39;re going to be finishing one night they don&amp;#39;t call them chapters they&amp;#39;re just kind of like named that way at the top CH list well there&amp;#39;s a lot there&amp;#39;s a lot there&amp;#39;s 32 okay so we are roughly yeah there&amp;#39;s 32 chapters some of these probably longer than others we are roughly past the uh halfway point okay so this will probably be we&amp;#39;ll get some help here not going to stop we we&amp;#39;ll we&amp;#39;ll do this one too soon this will all be just a bad memory but we are a good spot this is the place this isn&amp;#39;t creepy at all 17 yeah so to be at the half way point we would have to have completed 16 chapters which we just did so we will do this one to just to be on the safe side yeah cuz some some chapters will def be longer yeah hello AER who&amp;#39;s asking I was told you could help us I don&amp;#39;t know who told you that you came to the wrong place I&amp;#39;m sorry wait we really need your help come in come on in don&amp;#39;t be shy Luther would you be so kind as to take these lady&amp;#39;s coat oh don&amp;#39;t be afraid of friend here Luther is just another Android that I helped he keeps me company in this big empty old house you short did I [ __ ] up please make yourselves at home is that why it&amp;#39;ll be short cuz that made some bad decisions or how did you hear about me joking oh okay an Android on the street he said you could help us I see devian huh what about her she&amp;#39;s human and you want to find a safe place somewhere you can start a new life I hear Canada is very lovely at this time of year mhm beautiful landscapes Open Spaces clean air work for decision no Android laws so I have had some bad decision place for Fresh Start yes that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s exactly what we want of course I can help you but first we have to get rid of your tracker tracker yeah all Androids are fitted with a tracking device to locate them at all times I&amp;#39;ll remove yours and then you&amp;#39;ll both be safe come on follow me I don&amp;#39;t trust this uh the little one can wait for us in the living room no she always stays with me of course I talk to you right this way everything oh we need is in the basement yeah I don&amp;#39;t like this I don&amp;#39;t like this place and that man let&amp;#39;s go I have a bad feeling I know I don&amp;#39;t trust him either we have to be careful please excuse the mess I need it somewhere discreet for my machines removing trackers is illegal so I opted for discretion over Comfort I hope the little one isn&amp;#39;t too scared no no she&amp;#39;ll be all right that&amp;#39;s good this way please I don&amp;#39;t like how he&amp;#39;s just looming behind us electri build this place must be crazy if you could just stand over there well I can&amp;#39;t interact with anything else so I was planning to resist this not like a prompt or anything I should warn you this could be quite unpleasant oh my oh my gosh you know what&amp;#39;s strange for some unknown reason the trackers seem to stop working in deviants that&amp;#39;s why it&amp;#39;s so hard to find them so actually there&amp;#39;s no reason to remove your tracker what you said that yeah people believe what they want you deviant are so naive is there a way to avoid this I didn&amp;#39;t feel like I had I don&amp;#39;t feel like I had a choice here they all come to me expecting me to help them and I just I was like I a choice to do anything sell them all or I keep them for my little experiments no no I don&amp;#39;t want to be reset let me go I forgot about the child uh lock it up I&amp;#39;ll deal with it later Alice Alice wow wow a deviant that wants to be a mother that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s so sweet and so deluded I think it&amp;#39;s time we put you out of your misery there anything I can do it&amp;#39;s what you get for having a dream it always ends up the same way tears and disillusionment believe me you&amp;#39;re better off being raised and feeling nothing no more pain no more hope dashed almost you cara oh poor little Alice oh looks like Mommy doesn&amp;#39;t remember

that he&amp;#39;s actively guarding I&amp;#39;m not turning on the TV this is annoying the middle section the of the the middle sections of this game have not been nearly as good as like the beginning the opening sections of the game not that they&amp;#39;re bad it&amp;#39;s just like feel they feel way more like tedious car car you remember me how could I forget you I&amp;#39;m so sorry you were right we never should have come here we have to go follow me and don&amp;#39;t make any noise okay Luther yes Z I&amp;#39;m finished here go face the little one right away z z what the little one is gone I just disappeared got to be here somewhere what are you waiting for go look what the [ __ ] are you doing come here coming what okay I guess we didn&amp;#39;t hide long enough even though he literally got told to go okay whatever okay game why are we running into the guy with the shotgun I hate being punished for a QT Event that&amp;#39;s always really fun I enjoy that a lot a lot feels really [ __ ] good you can&amp;#39;t escape from me grab this gun no you&amp;#39;re not going to stay strapped here [Music] almost like we could have taken that from I was on the ground but that would have made for a less interesting Chase SC now wouldn&amp;#39;t it you just didn&amp;#39;t take it for no reason he has [ __ ] aim okay [Music] Alice it&amp;#39;ll just drop the child go Alice no I won&amp;#39;t leave go run as fast as you can I warned you dreams always end in tears you should have listened to me what are you doing get out of my way no not this time I said get out of my way or I&amp;#39;ll shoot right through you oh how dare you how dare you does that seem from Toy Story what are you doing who let you out get away from me get away from me obey me I&amp;#39;m your master I&amp;#39;m your master I didn&amp;#39;t want to hurt you he programmed me to obey him when I saw the little one risk her life to save you it was like opening my eyes for the first time finally I could see I know you have no reason to trust me after what I did but I know someone one who could help you across the border I could take you there I could protect you you and the little one all right I trust you so scared of losing you all right we how do y&amp;#39;all yeah yeah brain too coming in at the the very tail end all right wait was there like another wait this could have gone yeah well it looks like both pass lead to this [Music] okay yeah that is not yeah yeah that uh that was stressful that was very rful see the bus scene yet uh like you mean the one where which one cuz there&amp;#39;s been more ones with the bus you mean I don&amp;#39;t know like the one where we take the kid on then new accessing the extras section what is the survey thing great let&amp;#39;s start would you consider having a relationship with an Android that looks like a human uh like a rantic relationship dude I I barely have Rel relationships oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah that that fire pointed that out fire was like what the [ __ ] by the way did you know that you can review your story progress in the story chart section I you can also see the choices made by other players there she&amp;#39;s giving very candy value Vibes right now and I am not the biggest fan it is kind of kind of kind of scary spooky scary skeletons did you finish no papa no I did not I I am about the halfway point and I do I do not plan to play this all in one night um so I&amp;#39;m just going to leave it there yeah I&amp;#39;m just going to leave it there um yeah in terms of this game um it&amp;#39;s very good I see why people were uh into it and very much love this game and it was so like memeable back in the days um yeah I can see why it was the music&amp;#39;s really really good the stacks are cool I hope you&amp;#39;re okay today to you playing I know sometimes things can be difficult but I said I&amp;#39;m here for you who does that wait a minute wait a minute I&amp;#39;m like okay we&amp;#39;ll go split in two parts you homie just looked at me dead eyes uh no keep playing like who what the huh the [ __ ] huh I I&amp;#39;ve never anybody do that I don&amp;#39;t give a [ __ ] what you think you play instead um yeah that was really weird um yeah I can see why people love this game a lot I I cannot wait to finish it um I do think that lot like in the middle of the game it does start to like kind of like Mander a bit and like yeah kind of like fall off a tiny but it&amp;#39;s not bad it&amp;#39;s just kind of like like with Marcus where I&amp;#39;m just like literally going on like a I&amp;#39;m going on a scavenger hunt and that that scavenger was really really really long um there&amp;#39;s uh like I did I wasn&amp;#39;t actually a huge fan of this little side episode thing with like hey I&amp;#39;m going to like we&amp;#39;re going to go to this house and it&amp;#39;s actually a secret villain and the villains tried to kill you and now you got to escape cuz like we already did this in heavy rain like this isn&amp;#39;t like an exact plot line from Heavy Rain to a te with almost like no variation whatsoever so I&amp;#39;ve literally played this almost beep for beep before so I&amp;#39;m just like I know feels like just kind of like a uh like a bump on the road and not really like a part of their greater story cuz this wasn&amp;#39;t episodic right did you know Detroit was on the Underground Railroad a route for slaves escaping into Canada during the American Civil war no I didn&amp;#39;t totally did actually that was a lie I don&amp;#39;t I was just like no just to be [ __ ] sassy but I did that shows you my uh my my Primal Instinct there be argumentative um yeah I feel like some of the uh I definitely feel like some of this it&amp;#39;s like very like it&amp;#39;s very tedious in the middle and some of it&amp;#39;s lost a bit of steam but like I&amp;#39;m most excited to finish Conor story [Music] yeah most excited to finish uh Conor story or I want to be okay but like her story is kind of like losing interest for me and Marcus&amp;#39;s I&amp;#39;m like also kind of clocked out of but I guess we will see very smoo D of dbds good to see you friend unfortun came at the tail end here but I do appreciate you and it&amp;#39;s good seeing you if a man has not discovered something he will die for he&amp;#39;s not fit to live oh well that&amp;#39;s pretty fck Martin Luther King I thought you&amp;#39;d like it oh thanks bud appreciate that yeah we&amp;#39;ve we&amp;#39;ve talked plenty about like you know heavy rain&amp;#39;s very uh interesting director um yeah like I said that&amp;#39;s we got a little bit over the halfway point and we&amp;#39;re not going to sit here and and play this all night um so I&amp;#39;m going to cap it there we will try to finish wrap or wrap this up um next Saturday um uh ke were try to uh so things are kind of up in the air because of the uh the uh the family situation that I had yesterday uh got a um I don&amp;#39;t know how much I it&amp;#39;s too much info but essentially my mom is in the hospital um so um she&amp;#39;s fine is she definitely wasn&amp;#39;t fine earlier this week uh but she is in a relatively okay spot everything considered uh so streams may be weird here and there there might be days I have to take off uh some days I might stream on days that I have off you know it just kind of depends on what she needs what I can do and all that wonderful stuff but I was very happy I got to you know spend time with you guys and stream a little bit for you guys just you know know that you know streams will probably be a little weird uh the most important thing is not to live but to have a reason to live yeah that&amp;#39;s a quote from jeano a French can you be quiet can I go into menu so you can stop yelling at me accessing the options section okay you can be quiet thank you yeah it&amp;#39;s just the streams will be weird this upcoming week and we we&amp;#39;ll see how things go from there um yeah I appreciate you guys for being patient and being an awesome group of people to stream to and I&amp;#39;m glad I did get to slide in here and do a stream um you know I&amp;#39;ll try to keep the schedule as normal as possible as normal as I can uh which is as much as physically possible um but if things are weird in the future yeah that&amp;#39;s that would be why but yeah uh on a a bit of a lighter note um we&amp;#39;ll be finishing that Saturday if things work out if things aren&amp;#39;t if if things work out um I do plan to stream Monday uh and I believe I will be able to uh based on how things are working out right now so hopefully I will see you guys on Monday but we are going to be doing a raid friends so go and saddle up and we&amp;#39;re going to be raiding a good friend that I have known basically since the the dawn of my time in the dbd community met homie very very very very early on that is good old Wes

phone it&amp;#39;s not here how drunk was I last night the artist in dbd you would you mean you would catch the artist reference calling my phone with moms okay mom&amp;#39;s phone is probably in her room I can use it to call mine then figure out where the hell I left it Baboo Chloe look at her little cheeks she&amp;#39;s such a Baboo home sweet home whoever said you can&amp;#39;t go home again was probably Behavior did and he could go home again he just didn&amp;#39;t want to Beast is playing a DVD mobile right now and it&amp;#39;s just really interesting to see like like wow artist is on there wow that seems kind of annoying artist would seem very believe I used to sneak in there for her makeup I made this for Mom when I was like 10 years old if she wore it now I&amp;#39;m not sure which of us would be more embarrassed I hate that she hides all our old pictures of Dad it&amp;#39;s probably kind of painful to look at Dad if you could see us now I don&amp;#39;t like the idea of putting on the dresser bad enough that David comes here for dinner that happened to me once very traumatizing I was like oh oh okay mom&amp;#39;s finally making her bed again I guess that&amp;#39;s a good sign I want Mom to be happy but not like this not like this don&amp;#39;t be so mad all COPE in different ways sometimes you have to get knocked down lower than you&amp;#39;ve ever been to stand up taller than you ever were don&amp;#39;t give up on yourself a single spark can start a fire that burns the entire Prairie then start the fire I found mine in the trash I was like Oh e gross I think Mom&amp;#39;s phone is in her engagement ring supposed to be mine if I&amp;#39;m ever stupid enough to get married Grade B [ __ ] You Arcadia Pon wait mom selling her engagement ring uh uh I don&amp;#39;t know I feel like Chloe would do it I wouldn&amp;#39;t do it but I I got to remember I&amp;#39;m playing Chloe you don&amp;#39;t deserve to be stuck in a drawer like this why is she reading a loud cuz she&amp;#39;s in the game you know what&amp;#39;s funny too is that like I do that but it&amp;#39;s because just the Twitch streaming thing just kind to used still having like 30 40 people around me at any given point just in the imaginary space just like around me vly right so sometimes I I&amp;#39;ll accidentally monolog L I&amp;#39;m like [ __ ] I&amp;#39;m not streaming what am I doing just a habit I guess I should call my phone how can mom look at this every day and not see what a tool she&amp;#39;s dating you see a hammer screwdriver ho sounds like my phone is definitely nearby there we go wonder how many calls I&amp;#39;ve missed how&amp;#39;d you get it down there coming home at some point tonight chlo will you be home by curfew there will be consequences there will be consequences there will be change oh we can go smash just sucked if I passed that not a teenager that&amp;#39;s a whole ass man look at his [ __ ] face I think I did okay cool what you up to not much I already know everything okay out sorry you lost oh it literally is 2010 I made a joke about that&amp;#39;s such 2010 humor about you texting is better with me anyway dude I&amp;#39;m terrible about responding to people I think it was just I think I had an in I think I&amp;#39;ve had an inversion in my old age as I was so trained to be so attentive my whole life that I just I&amp;#39;m just exhausted so now I just do the opposite where I&amp;#39;m very like Bree with my attend [Music] this more in a bit like she says that like she&amp;#39;s a news ancher more than [Music] [Music] 11 training Queen crickets what&amp;#39;s the latest oh so she leaves her on red for quite a while I would also stop messaging this person breakfast bring my purse down with you please yeah yeah actually somebody rather recently cuz I reached out to them like three or four times you think I saw Mom&amp;#39;s purse in her room the captain blard still posting all their social media still talking to other people I&amp;#39;m like fine [ __ ] you fine clearly I&amp;#39;m not worth your time so you can you can enjoy never having my time again to impress her boyfriend maybe gray hair is his cryptonite maybe I should dye my gray oh I need to do that soon TI I was thinking about doing that uh if I weren&amp;#39;t so tired I would have done it today I need to do that again soon I guess I got to go downstairs now Chloe breakfast stop yelling at me wait mom wanted me to bring her purse silly goose I would have just forgotten that take oh can you grab my cell phone too no more Doling I need to talk to you Doling yeah that really makes me want to hurry coming mom you love the teenage angst finally you can put my purse on the dining table might still have time for breakfast if you hurry dining table here I come you&amp;#39;re going to dine on the whole table dad took these photos now that David&amp;#39;s staying over so much I wonder how long it&amp;#39;ll take Mom to shove them in a drawer somewhere if I ever ended up like like married and that sort of thing and then like for some horrible reason that person passed I would never ever want to hide that stuff if it makes that new person feel awkward they can get banned like [ __ ] you mom doesn&amp;#39;t want me to know but it&amp;#39;s pretty clear her boy toy David hasn&amp;#39;t worked in like a year oh any letter from Blackwell is never good is mom having trouble with payments again my scholarship doesn&amp;#39;t cover everything like I need another reason for principal Wells to get on my case don&amp;#39;t look at that room the same after the alternate timeline aren&amp;#39;t you glad glad you left for Seattle Max and never looked back uho dad always talked about upgrading to a flat screen too bad that never happened I would have gotten this bad boy in my room family pic used to hang here I wow I can&amp;#39;t actually remember which one hard to believe I was an eighth grade science athlete did I peak in Middle School well if you Peak twice then you have Twin Peaks sorry it&amp;#39;s my job to water these plants but it was Dad&amp;#39;s job to remind me so nobody&amp;#39;s fault really we&amp;#39;re already supporting one thanks from when Max and I spill spilled mom&amp;#39;s wine I think the only reason mom hasn&amp;#39;t recarpeted is so she can stay mad at me made that for Mom in an art class when I was like five she was never a smoker but it&amp;#39;s cool I was never an artist wait those aren&amp;#39;t mom&amp;#39;s keys and these would be David&amp;#39;s Keys there&amp;#39;s probably a better place for them than the ashtray I made mom like his home maybe mhm feeling trapped right there with you so edgy throw it break it disrespect to all surroundings little dude&amp;#39;s like what the hell just happened shoot I was hoping David could get a job on a container ship to Japan why do I suddenly want to get some fireworks this is principal Ray Wells let me be emphatic I have an enormous stick inserted into my butt thank you also Chloe you&amp;#39;re poor and in trouble that&amp;#39;s funny she actually made me laugh she&amp;#39;s actually not haven&amp;#39;t really felt like sitting down to eat since David started having dinner here Chloe I don&amp;#39;t have all day would you get over here already I should see what Mom wants before she Strokes out dad&amp;#39;s old swear jar we spent the last of his curses on bus fair and milk there&amp;#39;s a whole bus Fair there a lot of fairs for buses wow still rather stuck these sugar bombs in my mouth pot R roast mom hates pot roast B Clon it&amp;#39;s not that I&amp;#39;m ungrateful it&amp;#39;s just that when your mom works in a diner you&amp;#39;re not always in the mood for diner type food soft locks my phone like it just runs so poorly or how does do that Joyce price AKA mom she looks as beat as I feel hey Mom you wanted to talk Chloe what happened to you it&amp;#39;s no big deal I walked into a door you walked into a door you seem to be walking into a lot of doors lately when I send you a text message Chloe like last night I need you to answer you can just say text you don&amp;#39;t have to same message and I need you to answer without the snark sorry I hear you about replying thank you is that what you wanted to talk about what is it with you and David always cutting to the chase why can&amp;#39;t we just have some pleasant conversation before school I thought you hated pot you can have a no thank you helping no you hate pot roast I don&amp;#39;t care I don&amp;#39;t I don&amp;#39;t care likes it and don&amp;#39;t say you don&amp;#39;t care so that&amp;#39;s what we&amp;#39;re doing now whatever your boyfriend likes you do realize I hate your boyfriend with every fiber of my being right Chloe you don&amp;#39;t hate him he calls me girly he&amp;#39;s a dick hole he can be oldfashioned yeah an oldfashioned dick hole ah right School my favorite you used to love to learn yeah I used to think drugs were lame too I wish you wouldn&amp;#39;t joke like that awesome that&amp;#39;s weird I know TR M&amp;#39;s always been bad but that&amp;#39;s interesting are you selling your engagement ring Chloe jewelry gets appraised for all sorts of reasons like for insurance nice Dodge how about this you don&amp;#39;t go in my bedroom when I&amp;#39;m not there you asked me to you don&amp;#39;t ask me to get your damn purse then you got it then let&amp;#39;s not fight I made you breakfast n I&amp;#39;ll just grab something later you just send it in there that is on you&amp;#39;ll enjoy this the other day I made four eggs two for David two for me and just before I serve them he says what are you going to eat I&amp;#39;ll enjoy that huh tired huh that&amp;#39;ll teach you to break curfew what I know what time you came home last night and don&amp;#39;t think you can get out of school just because you missed the bus again why would you assume that who do you think your principal calls when you skip do you think I enjoy lying for you saying you&amp;#39;re sick just so you don&amp;#39;t get spelled between your grades and your disregard for my rules I see you slipping I&amp;#39;m worried but Mom the whole point of lowering expectations is so you won&amp;#39;t be disappointed in me ever again you&amp;#39;re happy doing what you&amp;#39;re doing fine keep at it just let me know so I can stop fighting with Blackwell to keep you on scholarship money&amp;#39;s tied enough as it is I like the answerers I need to be left alone but she would not miss out an opportunity to back on David maybe David should start paying rent he spends the night often enough how would you know you&amp;#39;re never here yourself David thinks you need discipline David should mind his own business I think it&amp;#39;s great great David&amp;#39;s taking an interest he&amp;#39;s a good man maybe he can help ah ah these choices H I&amp;#39;m Chloe though I got to I gotta I got to be Chloe dad was a good man that&amp;#39;s not fair I&amp;#39;m glad your father still has a place in your heart but sometimes we need to make more room in our hearts for new people and sometimes when we&amp;#39;re incredibly desperate and lonely we choose the absolute wrong kind of people to let into our hearts mom damn you know she&amp;#39;s been an idiot for like the past hour and 2 minutes but damn who that&amp;#39;s rough buddy that rough that&amp;#39;s real David&amp;#39;s had some hard times too you know if he&amp;#39;s kind enough to share got it I expect you to listen like I&amp;#39;d let him get within 15 ft of me when he takes you to school today very funny you will be nice you will be respectful and you will say thank you are you serious serious this is such what Chloe such [ __ ] up there Mom trying I guess maybe I should too but what&amp;#39;s the point in getting along if it means pretending everything&amp;#39;s fine when it&amp;#39;s not um let be nice for her mom mom well I do be loving her mom you&amp;#39;re dealing with a lot thank you chlo&amp;#39;s very prickly but she loves the people close to her so

iron repeatedly Chloe is that a black eye no insubordination no wonder your mother&amp;#39;s worried about you oh didn&amp;#39;t we in the first game didn&amp;#39;t we find some um some like lore about him through like files and stuff that he was also insubordinate like early on that&amp;#39;s sweet that&amp;#39;s interesting when I was your age I got into my share of scraps but it&amp;#39;s

on a what cheers me up on a bad day there&amp;#39;s a quote in here from noodle that&amp;#39;s very very funny noodle was telling uh we were telling stories about how when people have come on to us and like we&amp;#39;ve not enjoyed it like it&amp;#39;s been an uncomfortable thing talked about receiving uh some sensitive material once that they did not want and the way they described it was it looked like a little Gumby worm stuck to his leg was the Hest [ __ ] I have heard in recent memory that was so good it&amp;#39;s like a little gummy worm stuck to his leg leaving stuff in our garage anyway does he think he&amp;#39;s moving in or something do these have chapters on hotwiring your mom&amp;#39;s boyfriend&amp;#39;s car so you can drive it off a cliff asking for a friend uhoh mom&amp;#39;s been cleaning again hold the flashlight incorrectly dude that it was so that was like my life growing up I was just like hold this here go grab this I&amp;#39;m like you&amp;#39;ve never explained what this Isen soon might go get this what is this you&amp;#39;ve never explained this to me before I&amp;#39;ve never held it before how do I know to go grab it why are you taking so long it&amp;#39;s like you [ __ ] David&amp;#39;s lawnmower prama man maybe Mom and I like our lawn the way it is ever think of that dad&amp;#39;s toolbox he used to get so excited whenever anything sprung a leak or busted like you&amp;#39;re learning this so this will help you in life later on and you want to you want to help me learn that I needed therapy and I got into therapy that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s what help me learn gasoline just in case David&amp;#39;s car ever catches on fire damn the stereo used to be in Dad&amp;#39;s Workshop I should hook it up in my room before garbage day gets it first oh he does end up putting it up there [ __ ] for my life not there there that&amp;#39;s why I make that joke we&amp;#39;ll be doing on the Fridays and we co-oping like hold the light hold the light not there there 50/50 chance I smash him in the face with this 6040 some parents just referring to therapist yeah but it&amp;#39;s often because they ignored their own referral links huh I think for a lot of parents it&amp;#39;s like they&amp;#39;re better than their parents so they think they&amp;#39;re good I think that&amp;#39;s like wrench so I can get back to ignoring him

Beacon&amp;#39;s Young artist award for my photography you don&amp;#39;t say between that and the vortex Club it&amp;#39;s hard to keep people from putting me up on a pedestal or whatever but you know all about that what with Rachel Amber am I right wait what about Rachel Amber Rachel posted a slamming selfie of you two having time of your lives do tell it was a pretty normal night for us a little music a little dancing he murdered a guy you are so funny seriously though I didn&amp;#39;t realize you and Rachel were such BFFs we&amp;#39;re really not so what&amp;#39;s she into you know

[ __ ] no problem she just doing that SK Merchant walk here 100% right we didn&amp;#39;t talk to my gr morning Miss Grant Chloe are you all right yeah I&amp;#39;m fine [Music] H what do you think of this hypothesis that you&amp;#39;ll be in your seat by the time chemistry class begins nobody talks that way I want ruin the mystery science is all about Discovery Miss Grant guess you&amp;#39;ll have to wait and see with all the change that&amp;#39;s happening at Blackwell of late I suppose I can appreciate your consistent wiip Chloe what kind of change do you mean well the Prescot have made an extremely generous donation to the school which is good but instead of going to support more Science and Mathematics it&amp;#39;s all being dedicated to the art you don&amp;#39;t think more money should be spent in the Arts it&amp;#39;s not that exactly I recently made the case that stem program should receive more support but apparently our new donors disagree with me such as life I suppose somebody&amp;#39;s a teacher that&amp;#39;ll never happen and if it has happened it&amp;#39;s been very rare money always always goes to the stem never ever to the [ __ ] extracurricular come on Miss Grant actually know that yet look at it this way Miss Grant more art classes will keep all the smug self-absorbed types out of your science classroom articulate as always was a Prett cool yes what the [ __ ] is that supposed to mean the deep end of failure that guy was like Hulk Hogan which is the deep end of failure don&amp;#39;t do drugs brother students black have this her instinct to glom up into little groups like sheep and if you just want to be alone you get labeled like some dangerous Outsider just like any other prison except now the prison follows you wherever you go thanks to social media I can&amp;#39;t believe Rachel posted a photo of the two of us together last night she thinks you&amp;#39;re cute dude that&amp;#39;s why am I still an outsider if I&amp;#39;m hanging out with Rachel Amber now hey Cassie it&amp;#39;s good to see you and what does it mean that hanging out was so awesome does that make me just the same as every other student here nah [ __ ] that flowers always make me think of Springtime which makes me think of Summer which makes me think of getting the [ __ ] away from Blackwell for three whole months I love flowers we can moonwalk hold on hold on I did it for a second there we had it for a half seconds okay do it there was huh weirdly that makes me interested in walking on the stage okay we&amp;#39;ll do it again need my DVD from Steph I bet she&amp;#39;s nerding it up with Mikey somewhere shut up I should probably be getting to class but I the textures on your hat oh hi principal Wells hey Chloe price is that a black eye I&amp;#39;m uh yep I hope you know that Blackwell provides confidential counseling services for all our students we are a safe space for any issue I&amp;#39;m good it&amp;#39;s the other guy who needed a safe space from me you never fail to conform to your reputation do you miss price the sign clearly says do not walk on the stage such disregard for your fellow students efforts won&amp;#39;t alleviate your record of major infractions you can infract these how many minor infractions in a major one this is no joke Miss who&amp;#39;s joking you&amp;#39;ve seen my math grades perhaps you will find me less amusing if I mention things going sou been hearing about your drug you know Blackwell has a zero tolerance found in the first G do I have to initiate a search of your person in order to establish the veracity of these allegations Miss price that&amp;#39;s what I thought I&amp;#39;ll look forward that Cassie there is a that you can get that does have or that does show people&amp;#39;s uh shows people&amp;#39;s uh pronouns in twitch chat you can set your own it&amp;#39;s very cool well really works on Opera as well I have to convince him it&amp;#39;s in his best interest to back off actually sir I&amp;#39;m going to go with no ah so you&amp;#39;re going to mouth off to me now yes and here I thought your well of witticisms had finally run dry oh I get it cuz your name is Wells right you go around all day just hoping for an opportunity to make well references I wish OBS had must be a big moment for you had that extension to some extent like I could put it in my little over how the guilty cover up their infractions how did you become principal without learning the Constitution the Fourth Amendment a legal search and cedure we are a private institution and policy allows me to search all students on the premises I wonder if the Prescot might reconsider Their donation if Blackwell&amp;#39;s principal is being sued for harassment how do you know about the Prescott donation perhaps the better question you should be asking yourself is what else do I I know I&amp;#39;m sure we uh do not need to make so public an issue of so we saw that buy getting make no mistake Miss price this is not over o goodie I love Cliffhangers funny just a couple years ago something like that would have scared the crap out of me these days I&amp;#39;m at like the collegate level of not I&amp;#39;m a picture in the sunshine hey Chloe hey Samantha what are you reading who&amp;#39;s Afraid of Virginia wolf I read that last year in Mrs hoa&amp;#39;s English class I didn&amp;#39;t think you did

wolf and oh funny it is if you&amp;#39;re the wolf I&amp;#39;m not sure if you&amp;#39;re joking sorry I&amp;#39;m a little slow sometimes I&amp;#39;m a little [ __ ] sometimes so it&amp;#39;s cool people always say that but I think you&amp;#39;re actually sorry Chloe no one says anything like that I don&amp;#39;t know what I&amp;#39;m actually talking about I bet do you think of the ending it was kind of I kind of saw it coming I think it it kind of got a little like a little contrived but I don&amp;#39;t know that&amp;#39;s the way it be you know I I still think like the first three episodes were way better than the last two but damn girl that eye looks sick what&amp;#39;s going on hey out of the blue question what do you think of Rachel Amber she is amazing now if you&amp;#39;re into chicks that are Hot smart and hot I mean she helped me out a while back strong I was failing algebra hard I believe you check it after I bombed my midterm last fall she tuted me for the rest of the semester yeah this is a prequel C it takes place before the first game last night I scoped out this crazy party at the Old Mill up north kind of a DIY thing wow no [ __ ] I thought that place was like meth Central my cousin met this hooker there whatever it was cool okay you wouldn&amp;#39;t understand all right guess I&amp;#39;ll see you in class word remember we found him in the [ __ ]

land now laid to waste by the bloodthirsty Raiders of the black well alone you have fought your way through the Raider camps seeking their warlord leader duraron the unscarred as you enter the final Camp bloodied and weary you see your fellow hero approaching from the opposite direction I raise my staff to you and greeting I am Elon wizard of the third circle foremost adviser to King tiberias and swor defender of of your mom tabletops are really fun you should try them introduce your character yeah okay uh I&amp;#39;m an elf Barbarian named uh Calista calasa camasa sorry super into it not bad Shut up the two Heroes hold on Elon Narrows his eyes at the elf in front of him and says I am here to defeat duraron the unscarred in the name of King Tiberius what makes you think you are worthy to fight alongside me according to my character she I once made a man of Kebab I once stabbed a guy in the chest with a sword and it went all the way through and killed the guy behind him too true story you stand at a threeway Crossing to your left the Raiders training ground to your right their prison camp Straight Ahead an enormous aous T that could only belong to Duron the unscarred which way do you go straight ahead right we&amp;#39;re supposed to kill the D dude Elon frown the Raiders could have some good loot at the training ground and surely it is our duty to free all those prisoners your choice newbie where do you wish to go all right we&amp;#39;ll free the prisoners guess it&amp;#39;s time to free some peeps let&amp;#39;s go to the prison camp you behold a field of standing iron cages each imprisoning a human villager calling out for be back okay only a small elderly Dragon Kin is keeping watch he notices you and in Terror runs into one of the few empty cages and locks himself in ah poor little guy oh justly little guy Dragon K are like little dragon people they&amp;#39;re [ __ ] Dragon these nuts on your chin all the keys oh okay hey [ __ ] face get out of there the Dragon Kin hops up and down shaking his ring of keys at you he shouts in a strange language whatever he&amp;#39;s saying probably is isn&amp;#39;t flattering got any useful spells in that robe of yours nothing that wouldn&amp;#39;t blow up the cage and everything in it intimidate intimidate that&amp;#39;s a skill I have can I do that I want the little bastard to [ __ ] his pants you can try what do you say listen up you little lizard unfortunately he doesn&amp;#39;t speak common which means he I cast communication on the dragon all right enjoy the rest of work used appreciate really now he can understand every word you say time to work some real magic so this is called a skill challenge where you try to use oh I know what this is I grab the bars of the cage and lean in nice and close he steps back his scaly skin quivering in fear what do you say meep I wiggle my hand hey Dragon Kin guy want to become my meat puppet how it works is I shove my arm up your ass into your head and then I can control your mouth from the inside to say things uh he doesn&amp;#39;t seem to like that idea neither do I the dragon can pleads with you please don&amp;#39;t harm me tall one but I cannot give you key Duron much taller and meaner than you you&amp;#39;re short I say but I could fix that I&amp;#39;ll just cut off your head and wear it as a top hat then you&amp;#39;d be way taller the dragon can cowers before you looking left and right he opens his jaws and you think he&amp;#39;s about to yell for help I interrupt his yell by shoving my ax into the cage pinning his head to the bars without hurting him then I say the following this is going to you had to roll for that you had to roll for that I&amp;#39;m going to carve the skin from your bones then I&amp;#39;m going to turn your skin into a little leather handbag that&amp;#39;ll shove your skinless body into so I can carry it around with me wherever I go that way the next time some ass hat refuses to give me a key I want I can pull your body out and show them what happens how does that sound uh that was nuts I&amp;#39;m going to give you a plus 10 bonus to Charisma go ahead and roll that&amp;#39;s so much a small pool of UR collects under the elderly dragonkin as hands trembling it hands you the keys then it dies of fear awesome yeah go team why don&amp;#39;t you start unlocking the prisoners I&amp;#39;m on it as you free them the prisoners run away from you in fear what&amp;#39;s next loot sounds good let&amp;#39;s go to the training ground goblins sweet upon arriving at the training ground you are spotted by a heavy set orc who immediately shouts and points there are a dozen Raiders on the training field all of whom raise their weapons and charge okay so what do we do &amp;#39;s acid blast um Overkill bam

Bay maybe one day I&amp;#39;ll go back to Long Beach or anywhere but here maybe sooner than later I&amp;#39;m pretty sure Chloe is by but yeah any sort of LGB it&amp;#39;s still it&amp;#39;s still fairly rare to have LGBT characters as like the main characters which is unfortunate like we&amp;#39;ve come so far but it also feels so far away at the same time still me too Arcadia bacon suck a bag of dicks sometimes I feel like I&amp;#39;ve got no reason to stay don&amp;#39;t be surprised Chloe if one day I&amp;#39;m just out of here let me know if you need an accomplice check it out we&amp;#39;re here what the destination is on your left jum and find out the destination is on your left routing rerouting [ __ ] it breaks your legs smashes your skull it&amp;#39;s run over by the train bye [Music] it&amp;#39;s cute Until you realize they have to walk the whole way back what a girl doing just stand there under the tree like that that&amp;#39;s what I&amp;#39;m saying they are teenagers they don&amp;#39;t think shut through like I still don&amp;#39;t think some [ __ ] there to be honest little squirrel he&amp;#39;s just a little guy that&amp;#39;s a that&amp;#39;s a guy hey it&amp;#39;s actually a pretty nice view glad you approve and as your reward for making it up here I have a new game for us to play another one myav games deal with it this is what I learned in theater class it&amp;#39;s all about improvisation so far what I&amp;#39;ve learned about you is that you&amp;#39;re into lying and playing games what&amp;#39;s your point that you&amp;#39;re either full of imagination or full of [ __ ] those let me know when you figure out which one this game involves spying on people from afar luckily we&amp;#39;ve got some high-tech surveillance equipment right here let&amp;#39;s fire it up stop quit don&amp;#39;t you say a [ __ ] thing get it harder that blows well [ __ ] thought your last qut thought it was my last quarter oh you quarters damn hey maybe I can MacGyver something up I&amp;#39;ve been told I&amp;#39;m pretty handy oh yeah let&amp;#39;s see what you got I don&amp;#39;t like the way she well I guess I do for Chloe&amp;#39;s sake I do enjoy the way she up when you said handy oh Mikey oh we made friends with Mikey oh it&amp;#39;s his brother oh interesting Rachel really wants to use this viewfinder this whole day is get working for her but in the best possible way huh looks like I might be able to pry it open with the right tool anybody else think that like these look like little faces damn that&amp;#39;s an old tree wait does this sign say butt rot but rot yep through interior butt rot it&amp;#39;s am looks like this one might actually be working this black wall guy sure liked founding stuff that was already there Founders Keepers I guess yeah you would not imagine how that is like a summary of a lot of things in history yeah cliche much aw and BW I guess nature doesn&amp;#39;t quite provide yeah the ma sheine looks like that I wonder if I could use this to get the quarter out I wonder if I could use this to get the quarter out evidently not so you can only look at it I actually take it oh the poor tire swing if Max were here she&amp;#39;d probably take a black and after that I don&amp;#39;t know Innocence Lost I feel like anybody I&amp;#39;ve ever carved initials and do anything with never lasted so maybe it&amp;#39;s just cursed wait is that the same a as before not afraid of commitment I see I&amp;#39;ve been saying sorry all morning I ad it was really dumb to lock the keys in the car you&amp;#39;ve been on me for 3 hours hey spare some change sorry we might have some leftover food when we&amp;#39;re done what no I&amp;#39;m not hey phip it&amp;#39;s good to see you what kind of food doing right how are you this place has really gone downhill sh she&amp;#39;s right there my hierarchy of needs goes pot then beer then wine still wno has a classy ring to it there&amp;#39;s got to be something freeing about being able to build your home wherever you are from whatever is around you home is where the heart is that&amp;#39;s why they&amp;#39;re called homies so they feel like home I want to scare the squirrels but they might have something I could use I wonder if I could use this to get the quarter out I don&amp;#39;t want to head down there just yet I love how she&amp;#39;s just does that when she doesn&amp;#39;t want to go somewhere all right sorry guys get out of here Woodland creatures have some self-respect by you fools Lord of the Rings reference what we&amp;#39;re just switching which ones are there get out of here Woodland creatures have some self-respect you know what&amp;#39;s funny I always wondered like I could use this to get the quarter out like I know ganal was essentially a a family friend to Bilbo and which is why a lot of like reacts so harshly for him dying but I noticed that like a lot of the other like Fellowship members are like nearly crying and dying or like over him dying and like kind of freaking out and then like I actually like got into Lord Ring&amp;#39;s lore and stuff and it&amp;#39;s essentially that like the Wizards are like essentially a bridge between like their version of heaven and real life so essentially was watching like a demi Angel [ __ ] die which is got to shake your faith a little bit whoa that&amp;#39;s badass one of my favorite things I found out about lordings lore when I first started getting into it was um so one of the big plot points in L of the Rings in uh Fellowship of the Ring is the mythal shirt that uh froto gets uh because that&amp;#39;s what ends up saving from the cave troll later um one of the fun really killed it with this statue of an Explorer guy one of the funniest things is that Ladi at though it&amp;#39;s like a blinking you&amp;#39;ll miss sort of thing home washing laundry and spitting out kids is that um when Bill was giving it to fro he&amp;#39;s like this is uh from uh an Elven Prince it was meant to protect him the funny thing though is that the only Prince born in recent memory in The Lord of the Rings universe is legless but legless is a fully grown adult which means that froto is wearing leg&amp;#39;s baby clothes wonder if I can get that quarter out is what that means by you fools honestly there&amp;#39;s a uh there&amp;#39;s a missed opportunity there for legist to be like what the hey that&amp;#39;s mine get out of here Woodland creature have some self-respect what is the point what are we supposed to be doing we&amp;#39;re supposed to be getting something to pry open the viewfinder but like about the mythal shirt and the follow ship is it is it is it related to that or is it just like plot armor and you think it&amp;#39;s stupid or like what the [ __ ] can we what are he supposed to be [ __ ] doing I love when the game play is just needle in a Hast stack wait is that the same aw as before not afraid of commitment I see still money I don&amp;#39;t I don&amp;#39;t know we&amp;#39;ve walked around this place like five times so there&amp;#39;s just like like two [ __ ] beehive throw in the Beehive what there&amp;#39;s a beehive where Birds Nast I can only look at it I can&amp;#39;t do anything with it there&amp;#39;s got to be something freeing about being able to build your home wherever you are from whatever is around you yeah we should have upon you tress got you that viewfinder looked pretty weak sauce yeah well I wonder if I can I need AOL to do that am I just going to do with my [ __ ] mind Powers just stare at it long enough not getting in there with just my fingers maybe Rachel has something I can use why did she say fingers like that she said fingers that was cute uh I&amp;#39;m thinking about prying open that fing got a knife on you a knife yeah my mom took mine uh no you just ask her for nail file you just ask her for the solution that&amp;#39;s so silly I guess you could stab someone with a nail file what you have a knife no sure let&amp;#39;s try it Victoria Chloe price well if it isn&amp;#39;t the consequence of my actions that spells [ __ ] you on the periodic table Yeah you call me a coniss and then we file this off and then we just that oh where that your rer good job stealing a dedication plate takes persistence you thought you were going to say dedication is on the more path oh no seriously help you kill me this morning this what the GM does oh yeah that&amp;#39;s right that&amp;#39;s [ __ ] that&amp;#39;s Rachels down file you can&amp;#39;t just throw that [ __ ] away got power activate even use seem disinterested in that joke this first episode has been most of stream which I think makes sense if the game is like full length and it&amp;#39;s the game is re up into three episodes well it&amp;#39;s four technically just three episodes in the best episode game over I win that was enough of a game for me your mgy skills are second To None except probably mcgyver somebody in the food develop this game really [ __ ] like that show evidently Rachel smells like Jasmine is she smelling me right now too really should have showered this morning all right here&amp;#39;s the game you you find some people for us to spy on and then you and I will act out what they&amp;#39;re saying and thinking that&amp;#39;s it I do that in my head during like every class see you&amp;#39;re natural let&amp;#39;s give it a try hey what do you say we barbecue some squirrels when we&amp;#39;re done here God you just have the best

chug chug chug chug could use a drink after trying to keep up with you I am excess there&amp;#39;s something very interesting about the writing of this game cuz like Chloe starts off the game criticizing and being shitty to her mom about you know having a stronger connection obviously with her dad and then just being vulnerable and letting someone shitty in like d uh David but in a sense Chloe is doing the exact same thing she realistically just misses Max but she&amp;#39;s just kind of shoving Rachel into the hole where Max once held inside her sober right now dring undering kind of taboo I mean guess we&amp;#39;re leaving now it&amp;#39;s one of those things where like you know this kind of weird coming from me because like you know I took a straight Ed budge and never drank but like kids kids do that you know like this isn&amp;#39;t Barney and Friends like kids this is real life kids do [Music] thatb relationship made a sense yeah cuz I don&amp;#39;t they were kids kids so there was nothing at least at the time that was romantic between Max and um Chloe but yeah it&amp;#39;s feeling the void of where Max is gone with another person who hey check this out what [Music] this is where you&amp;#39;ll be laid to rest [ __ ] this is where they&amp;#39;ll put you in the [Music] dirt great it&amp;#39;s a pile of trash uh yeah an awesome pile of trash let&amp;#39;s explore you have fun Chloe I&amp;#39;m going to go sit down Rachel&amp;#39;s been acting kind of standoffish ever since we left the park what&amp;#39;s her deal you got you sister I think Colorado is the r boot I definitely want to ask her about it I&amp;#39;ve heard that actors are Moody but wow Rachel I&amp;#39;m not moody I just need some space is that all right with you okay I&amp;#39;m kind of stuck out here with you so actually no I thought we were having a great day together why are you acting like this all of a sudden I&amp;#39;m not acting like anything I just want to be left alone right now why&amp;#39;d you bring me with you no I don&amp;#39;t understand you can&amp;#39;t just turn on me for no reason I&amp;#39;m sorry turn on you I guess I forgot it&amp;#39;s always about how you feel isn&amp;#39;t it sad chlo&amp;#39;s [ __ ] sad again maybe you should try giving a [ __ ] about other people for once what the [ __ ] are you serious right now [ __ ] oh [ __ ] even Chloe&amp;#39;s like uh okay I still have no idea what&amp;#39;s going on with Rachel but apparently don&amp;#39;t IGN all the red flags when she&amp;#39;s angry pay attention to them I can work with that score kill her damn here if you really want to smash something this should do the trick it&amp;#39;s like a rage room impromptu I asked you to leave me alone are you kidding me I I know you&amp;#39;re the school princess and all with the da daddy and the perfect grades and all the perfect little Victoria chases kissing your perfect ass but seriously [ __ ] you great I&amp;#39;m leaving see you around Chloe you can&amp;#39;t leave watch me Rachel what ass hat don&amp;#39;t go why not because because I don&amp;#39;t want to ruin this the way I ruin everything else in my life and what is this exactly dude we just met today what I mean we definitely want the ladder don&amp;#39;t get me wrong we definitely want the other thing we definitely want the other thing but uh I thinking apps wait what we met today yeah I feel like getting this [ __ ] emotional about the Friendship Day one is still [ __ ] intense much less [ __ ] the other thing that&amp;#39;s a red flag too fast I mean [ __ ] are you actually going to make me say it say what exactly you know like okay a friendship but more I know weird right you what you what it&amp;#39;s just today was the best day I&amp;#39;ve had since since my dad died and when I almost ruined it just now the way I ruin everything it made me realize chlo I need I need to hug you darling whatever&amp;#39;s going on between us

lover&amp;#39;s quarrel you might say she nearly took your head [Music] off what what do you care sorry sweetheart I guess I&amp;#39;m getting into your personal business I guess I did that sometimes people need you though even when they don&amp;#39;t admit it Rachel this girl is on fire yep I sleep in a place like that like I fall sleep in way worse places way worse places you&amp;#39;re tired stressed or traumatized sometimes all three at once you can sleep about anywhere you&amp;#39;re like sleep at all thank God so but this is still the first episode apparently how&amp;#39; she know she&amp;#39;d be here you came I&amp;#39;m glad hey I couldn&amp;#39;t let the day end with whatever this afternoon was Chloe I want to talk to you about something but I don&amp;#39;t know how to talk about this you don&amp;#39;t have to tell me anything you don&amp;#39;t want to you remember that guy that we saw under this tree with that woman the ones who were making out that was my dad oh all right and that woman was definitely not my mom oh the worst part is what you say this to me it&amp;#39;s just cuz it is literally 201 I felt like my dad&amp;#39;s lying about something for a while I just I didn&amp;#39;t know what it was so when I saw he got a text from an unknown number asking him to meet I thought I thought I could catch him or something I&amp;#39;m so sorry Rachel I don&amp;#39;t I don&amp;#39;t know what to say neither do I Chloe I love my dad I love him and I never want to see his [ __ ] face again when my dad died I was so mad at him for months I felt wrong because half the time I thought of him I wanted to scream and the other half I forgot forgot that anything had changed it&amp;#39;s silly but I&amp;#39;ve carried this photo around with me for years it&amp;#39;s from Mount Hood my dad took me hiking there when I was 10 and it started raining and I fell and broke my arm three miles from the car I remember screaming she also things on her hand remember my dad he carried me down the mountain I still remember the smell of his coat and how calm he was and the sound of his voice and he was just so strong you know I felt safe no gosh you trusted him completely here Chloe I owe you an apology don&amp;#39;t don&amp;#39;t worry about it no I mean it whatever&amp;#39;s going on between us it&amp;#39;s intense and new and awesome and you had the courage to tell me that you feel it too and I treated you like [ __ ] you did courage I don&amp;#39;t know if I&amp;#39;d call it that more like blind desperation and maybe a slight buzz from that wine I just want you to know I&amp;#39;m lucky that you were with me today you&amp;#39;re a badass chlo price what remember that biker [ __ ] who wouldn&amp;#39;t let you into the mill you talked your way right past him you saw that and those skevy douchebags who followed you upstairs you dropped that one guy with a knee to the balls only because you showed up at the last minute and what about Drew when he was picking on Nathan you got right in his face and called him out that was pretty sweet actually actually see you&amp;#39;re the real thing Chloe I don&amp;#39;t know anyone like you plus you came along with me no questions asked well I don&amp;#39;t really need a good reason to ditch school I guess tomorrow they&amp;#39;ll be held to pay my mom might skip grounding just goes straight to the death penalty and my dad will definitely punish me with [ __ ] your dad [ __ ] him what I wouldn&amp;#39;t give to leave this place and never look back what&amp;#39;s stopping us us are you serious there&amp;#39;s nothing keeping me here not anymore so if I came to you tomorrow and told you to pack your bags I&amp;#39;m serious let&amp;#39;s do it Chloe let&amp;#39;s leave this Place forever [Music] okay can I borrow your lighter thank you [Music] you forest fire yeah you got to put that out when you&amp;#39;re done at least come on you&amp;#39;re going to leave it oh hey hey that&amp;#39;s not that&amp;#39;s not good realized like oh [ __ ] this is not good [Music] I means you are she already lost me before but yeah just like just willingly causing a forious fire cuz you&amp;#39;re so [ __ ] edgy like come on yeah there was a little like little cast of wind there she screams there was there was visual effects that something was going down [Music] yeah cuz it&amp;#39;s very clear she screams multiple times and the other times it&amp;#39;s normal and that one time has all that extra effects now it could have been just a flourish just for the sake of like you know artsiness but it also could have me [Music] something yeah she straight up started Force fire great why is the mistress just chilling here huh she Liv in the [ __ ] Woods you attacked hell yeah you&amp;#39;re kind of Joy good defend Nathan you&amp;#39;re more than friends good didn&amp;#39;t take the money I didn&amp;#39;t even notice the money didn&amp;#39;t purchase you read that Self book he didn&amp;#39;t slip money into Joyce&amp;#39;s purse oh there&amp;#39;s money we could have found in his garage and helped oh okay most people went to the play with Elliott really that&amp;#39;s interesting most people didn&amp;#39;t even listen to his demo weird most people didn&amp;#39;t sabotage or homework missed opportunity honestly Rachel you believe in love that split down the middle it&amp;#39;s getting going amp show too I will say that was some of the really good voice acting like really really good like they they nailed those performances like to te absolutely excellent Miss price how good of you to join us I&amp;#39;m so sorry we&amp;#39;re late my my shift ran late at the diner and then just sorry let us proceed one of you here is new to the Blackwell disciplinary process and the other is all too familiar with it Blackwell&amp;#39;s code of conduct is built upon a foundation of mutual respect meant to Foster an environment conducive to education and enrichment when that respect violated reality check time yesterday did actually happen I ditched school with Rachel Amber and then Rachel did start that fire and that was after we actually agreed to run away from here here right are you paying attention to me Chloe um what Miss price the last time we met an agreement was broken do you recall what that was I really like um Chloe&amp;#39;s writing in this game way more because it feels like to a certain extent that a lot of Khloe&amp;#39;s writing in in the original life is strange is is made that way because it&amp;#39;s a choices game and she&amp;#39;s made to say very out there and like shaming things just to like you know reinforce the fact that it is a choices game the fact the choices you made as Max were somewhat positive for her but or negative for her and she needs to really let you know in black and white terms that was good I liked that or I hated that please don&amp;#39;t I you need to be shamed for doing that and in this game because they don&amp;#39;t have that as much it&amp;#39;s more just trying to tell a story the characters act way more organically including Chloe cuz they&amp;#39;re not trying to show off a game gimmick they&amp;#39;re just trying to tell the story so I feel like it comes off way better uh don&amp;#39;t get in trouble again trouble is merely the byproduct Miss price what&amp;#39;s at issue is your attitude we agreed that you would rededicate yourself to becoming an exemp I highlight every playr that I do we for The Saturdays in the event that you were unable or unwilling to do so we also agreed that it would become pertinent to reassess your future status at the Academy despite all this you engaged in the following I will say though because of there&amp;#39;s a lot of c music there&amp;#39;s some mut Parts but there only like one or twoing signs about trespassing on the stage implications of possible drug rated activities what does that mean yes what does that mean it means Miss price has developed a reputation as a user of marijuana and I would strongly recommend you take a careful look through her room at home shall I continue attempting to sabotage the academic goals of one of our top students Victoria Chase academic goals like doing her own homework because I thought Blackwell had a zero tolerance policy on plagiarism excellent suggestion stricter punishment for students who violate black Well&amp;#39;s code of conduct is next on our agenda now hold on why is Chloe being punished for someone else&amp;#39;s plagiarism doesn&amp;#39;t make sense does it the infraction involved both students Victoria will be reprimanded as well I doubt yeah I bet for her plagiarism Miss Chase might have been suspended might have if Mr Prescott Nathan Prescott hadn&amp;#39;t spoken to me on Victoria&amp;#39;s behalf and we have witnesses saying Miss price was also involved in a bullying incident of the same Mr Prescott I helped the hell I was I stood up for that little weirdo I suppose that&amp;#39;s one interpretation of events say what you will about my daughter but she is not a bully maybe you should be talking to Drew instead of me you know the guy who actually did what you&amp;#39;re accusing me of Mr North&amp;#39;s situation requires sensitivity it will be handled no this is like like dead ass this is one of the reasons I another reason I fell teaching CU this is like this is even necessarily because it&amp;#39;s like a hoyy toyy private school like even in even in public school like just keeping things as like the point is not making the correct Solution that&amp;#39;s morally right it&amp;#39;s how can we keep the day-to-day operations of the school as smooth easy breezy and peaceful as possible your kids are not your administrator A&amp;#39;s best interest it&amp;#39;s keeping the the day-to-day functions of the school as smooth as possible it doesn&amp;#39;t matter about what&amp;#39;s doing what&amp;#39;s right it&amp;#39;s not it doesn&amp;#39;t matter about your kids like it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s just about running [ __ ] that&amp;#39;s all it is and it was the same but every school I ever I ever taught that cameras in the 2010s probably not in the 2010s mine didn&amp;#39;t well M mine did they just couldn&amp;#39;t afford to run them so a private school probably separately and Chloe&amp;#39;s situation is less sensitive I do not discuss other students situations we are here to discuss your daughter and her actions convenient mom you know this is all [ __ ] right I&amp;#39;m beginning to suspect that myself o I am sorry you feel that way but your daughter&amp;#39;s misbehavior is real and serious and yet even with your prodigious disciplinary record Miss price we dude there was so many times of it all right anyways yeah it was so funny because like I remember there was one time a teacher tried to use that as like like a threat against us like you know there&amp;#39;s you know there&amp;#39;s cameras outside you know there&amp;#39;s cameras in the hallways when I was like bro we know that [ __ ] isn&amp;#39;t on you I&amp;#39;m getting in trouble for cursing more so than the threat because like just called him out like that we know that&amp;#39;s not on so [ __ ] funny oh I broke the we needed oh there we go no because you severed your relationship with Blackwell the minute you left school grounds without permission what does that mean it means you for for my hand this is a consequence of your actions Chloe I have no choice but I need do it what what what what yesterday was all me my idea I was having a bad day I needed to blow off some steam and I took it too far Chloe tried to talk me out of it I&amp;#39;ve been down that road she told me you&amp;#39;re better than this but I wouldn&amp;#39;t listen see Chloe was afraid I&amp;#39;d get in trouble or hurt so she came with me but only to keep me safe I&amp;#39;m just sorry you got caught up in it Chloe that you allowed me to drag you down to my level can you forgive me yeah sure we&amp;#39;re cool thank you I&amp;#39;ll make it up to you I promise Chloe is this true it&amp;#39;s true totally not true she really is an amazing actress Miss price I want to say [ __ ] right now fine yes it was her idea but it&amp;#39;s not like she kidnapped me we were in it together Miss Amber based on what you&amp;#39;ve just told me I have grounds to punish you are you sure what you&amp;#39;ve told me is the truth yes this favoritism he&amp;#39;s like so hesitant to punish her but like not the other way around just to be clear Miss Amber you&amp;#39;re sure Chloe price didn&amp;#39;t coer you or coer her I&amp;#39;m just trying to get to the bottom of why someone like Rachel oh I think we&amp;#39;re clear principal Wells someone like Rachel but not my daughter yeah excuse me do you have a list of students you assume the worst about also it really [ __ ] bothers me that like his college shirt doesn&amp;#39;t go up to his neck like really low for no reason you have no right to treat Chloe this way this is because she&amp;#39;s on financial aid isn&amp;#39;t it let&amp;#39;s all just calm down after everything we she&amp;#39;s been through in the last two years you should be ashamed of yourself oo o Rachel&amp;#39;s not the only one starting fires Joyce is cooking too damn Miss price Mrs price Mrs price I appreciate your position but I assure you it is only your daughter&amp;#39;s past behavior that has led us here today I understand Mr Wells there is no doubt that Khloe&amp;#39;s Behavior must improve but given what we&amp;#39;ve just learned about the negative influence she was under I hope you will allow her just one more chance Miss Amber I am as surprised as I am disappointed in you I understand this being your first infraction in no way redu es its severity still we will not be suspending you at this time but you have squandered our trust you will no longer be my Administrative Assistant first period and you will no longer be involved in Blackwell&amp;#39;s performance of The Tempest Dam that&amp;#39;s rough that&amp;#39;s cuz her dad&amp;#39;s cheating [ __ ] but the perform performance is tonight for someone so aware of our school calendar Miss price I would expect fewer absences on your record Reay she loves that show since this is her first infraction Mr Amber I don&amp;#39;t tell you how to run the District Attorney&amp;#39;s office please don&amp;#39;t tell me how to run my school there&amp;#39;s a reason we have under studies for all circumstances accidental and deliberate I&amp;#39;m sure your understudy Victoria Chase damn [ __ ] this is the bad ending [ __ ] yes I&amp;#39;m sure Victoria Chase will do fine damn it that is such what was that Miss price Chloe is upset for her friend but we are both grateful that she is not going to be unduly blamed for what happened there is plenty of blame to go around Khloe&amp;#39;s future at Blackwell will be discussed next unless you had something to add first Miss price no let&amp;#39;s just go Rachel&amp;#39;s man no nothing to add I&amp;#39;m glad though Khloe may not have been The Mastermind of yesterday&amp;#39;s events it was as I prefaced the proverbial last straw in light of your many past transgressions I have no choice but to suspend you for the the rest of the year holy [ __ ] but it was the other girl&amp;#39;s idea she confessed and she will be punished accordingly but that does not absolve Khloe of her responsibility well damn you know what I used to think Chloe was exaggerating about you but now I see that she didn&amp;#39;t go nearly far enough Joyce is so [ __ ] mother let me remind you that chlo&amp;#39;s case for reinstatement begins now her actions and those of your own will be weighed carefully when the time comes do you understand me both of you Royce is now a buyers literally cooking a not breakfast there you go yeah I mean as much as I ever do Chloe we understand Mr Wells I will have skip Matthews escort you to clean out your locker you may wait outside my office and till he arrives that is all good day Mrs price Mr and Mrs Amber Ray Ray come on Chloe Mysterio I&amp;#39;m sorry I&amp;#39;m sorry too meet me at the junkyard later you bet I didn&amp;#39;t get the chance to introduce myself I&amp;#39;m Jo Mrs price I&amp;#39;m Rose this is James I&amp;#39;m sorry we had to meet like this no I&amp;#39;m sorry I&amp;#39;m sure for you this is an unusual circumstance parents are brunette we

love how every time someone tells me how much potential I have it&amp;#39;s right before saying how I&amp;#39;m wasting it [Music] all this was this is a really sad version of this but one of the most fun times I I always had uh teaching was like end of year where we&amp;#39;d pull out the giant garbage BS in the middle of the hallway I just let the kids go ham on throwing their stuff away we&amp;#39; be playing like little Trash little basketball trash can games and stuff you helping the little homies carry [ __ ] that was Heavy of my graffiti it was wholesome you&amp;#39;ve served me

wrong combination and I kept asking to get another one or for them to switch it and they just never did so they could have just you could have just [ __ ] had money if they ever [ __ ] worked over the effort for it for two weeks maybe Kim was the class I hated the least that book is property of the uh okay I broke his property of the school probably so a time machange so I can&amp;#39;t have your locker yeah no other reason not that I can actually like say hi to you or like all right I hid my just so you can take my lock behind my books H if Chloe leaves Blackwell at 11: a.m. going 100 mph how long will it take her to get as far away as [ __ ] possible if if you&amp;#39;re missing the context um Liz and I went to the same high school for two weeks and somehow didn&amp;#39;t meet which is

friendly little caterpillar that hides under his lip yeah it made little home between his nose and his upper lip Okay mad three guesses whose bike this is and they all start with Miss Grant damn I guess I will what you about this place wells&amp;#39;s Car Crushing Spirits must pay pretty well do taking pride in Blackwell Athletics means taking pride in yourself also the trustees and their enormous bank accounts another reason I [ __ ] here you go me and teaching don&amp;#39;t get along anymore his head much that has to be Skip&amp;#39;s car that&amp;#39;s what they do best here at Blackwell empty things out and toss them aside it&amp;#39;s about damn time David please very goofy little shoes how does anybody take you seriously I&amp;#39;ll handle it Chloe after today Chloe your mother and I have been talking can we do this later I don&amp;#39;t think I can handle another fight right now and who do you expect to handle things for you your just wait till we get home this isn&amp;#39;t a fight Chloe it&amp;#39;s a conversation remember that I don&amp;#39;t need a conversation not with Sergeant ass hat here I just need some space do not not use that language with your mother if my mother has something to say she will say it to me she has the problem is you don&amp;#39;t listen maybe if you try listening to me instead of fighting me about everything you might actually learn the problem is like he doesn&amp;#39;t have even have any experience being a parent you know what I&amp;#39;m saying like he&amp;#39;s he thinks he could just apply all of his military Gruff to Parenting but he hasn&amp;#39;t he hasn&amp;#39;t even had any experience like like to our knowledge he hasn&amp;#39;t even had a [ __ ] pet so like like how are you going to like how do you assume that you know everything about how to handle a child a thing or two what like how to have no job or how to be a soldier oh soldiers put family and future above self and and now getting kicked out of school nah they just invade third war countries at the behest of larger countries sorry that&amp;#39;s what losers do David that&amp;#39;s out of line you weren&amp;#39;t with us in there Chloe was treated unfairly now you&amp;#39;re making excuses for her Chloe needs to take responsibility I decide what Chloe needs not you right now what I need most of all is for the two of you to start getting along Chloe I care about Joyce very much I&amp;#39;m willing to forgive you for the incident yesterday what incident if you improve your attitude going forward incident what incident I&amp;#39;ll just say we had a rather Frank discussion who&amp;#39;s Frank the drug dealer but with an apology I&amp;#39;m willing to start over Rejoice sure reset button pressed I am glad to hear it from now on I will be assisting your mother in a few areas like making sure that you are no longer abusing drugs or alcohol I&amp;#39;m not abusing them I&amp;#39;m using them in moderation do you really think now is the right time Joyce please we must be a united front my brother it&amp;#39;s not a [ __ ] military situation Chloe I&amp;#39;d like you to empty your pockets and place all your belongings on the trunk of the car what the [ __ ] if we are going to start over we have to know that you are not abusing drugs if you&amp;#39;re not you should be eager for the chance to prove it Mom you saw how I was treated in the there now you want to treat me the same way I don&amp;#39;t need more discipline from you I need my mom I know Chloe and I&amp;#39;m sorry but David feels Joyce we feel this is the best way to start fresh I like that let&amp;#39;s go Chloe quit stalling actually all the Stalls are in there in the restrooms I&amp;#39;m not a stall my person [ __ ] [ __ ] strangle him uh I hate this music it kind of just like hurts my ears I know it&amp;#39;s supposed to just like stress me into making a decision but it kind of just like bothers me I don&amp;#39;t I don&amp;#39;t like this I don&amp;#39;t I don&amp;#39;t like this cuz this clearly seems to be his idea not hers we [Music] she goes into the chase them yeah sure here you go show me a warrant [ __ ] you watch too much television your refusal to comply is as good as an admission that&amp;#39;s not true at all if anything the established structure uses your implication of that to their advantage to force confessions out of you for their uh ease so yeah not that I admit to you being a fascist and I don&amp;#39;t take orders from fascists what happened to trust being a two-way street hey that was before you were suspended she&amp;#39;s a lawyer I know you haven&amp;#39;t always been treated fairly and I&amp;#39;m not trying to add to that yeah but you are though you are though somewhere along the way we lost our trust this is not the way to get it back true not at all okay that&amp;#39;s it she&amp;#39;s basically admitted her guilt and you&amp;#39;re letting her off the hook I am not letting her off the hook I am trying to find a way for us to move on all in school parking lot by the way need a new beginning a new chapter one that will involve the three of us together the three what does that mean we both agree that the best thing for everyone at this stage is for me to move in oh no [ __ ] way after everything that&amp;#39;s happened I&amp;#39;m at a loss I need help exactly we need a firmer hand steering this ship talk to me chlo tell me what you&amp;#39;re feeling mad I how both of these are like vulnerable answers like neither of these answers are really like her like it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s her in a weak space which is sad to see Mom I I I know I [ __ ] up I&amp;#39;m a [ __ ] up I&amp;#39;m sorry I&amp;#39;ve been shutting you out even though I&amp;#39;ve needed you and you need me and I know that but this is not the answer it&amp;#39;s the only answer I have Chloe in a million years I never thought you&amp;#39;d choose David over me I&amp;#39;m sorry I took that for granted I&amp;#39;m not choosing anyone over anyone else it&amp;#39;s about the three of us having a home together it&amp;#39;ll be better than you think Chloe once everything&amp;#39;s running smoothly you&amp;#39;ll see what a stable home can be like I think the I think the thing is like it&amp;#39;s very clear that like like it&amp;#39;s not just the I miss my dad thing cuz like there she&amp;#39;s going to be to some extent irrational because like she just misses her dad she just wants her dad back which is not realistic and her mom is eventually going to find love again and want that person around in a similar position and that&amp;#39;s going to be rough regardless for both of you but it&amp;#39;s clear that outside of just the rawness of someone knew filling that position there are things that she fundamentally hates about this person and rightfully so it&amp;#39;s not just a trauma response it&amp;#39;s a I generally don&amp;#39;t like you I think you&amp;#39;re bad for our family [Music] response hey there is no home not if he&amp;#39;s there Chloe Let Her Go she&amp;#39;ll come home as soon as her tantrum is over there think because of his military experience he knows all the right answers to everything and he can just push people around like he&amp;#39;s an authority respect is earned how do you know which way is up when your whole life has been turned upside down [Music] black Hall&amp;#39;s done with me I can&amp;#39;t go home anymore is this junkyard all I&amp;#39;ve got left [Music] [Music] [Music] that D truck that our truck [Music] license PL no this thing is a mess but maybe I can fix it they&amp;#39;re not gonna pan back to it now if this Beast will ever run again just thinks like he&amp;#39;s trying to do best need my daughter back she&amp;#39;s still right there yeah that fire has consequences and the first thing it needs is a new battery and butn wonder if I can find one around hereit that a reference to something I&amp;#39;m missing magical battery goes here as soon as I magically find one p oh know that I think I&amp;#39;m all smashed out for now we can climb the boat it&amp;#39;s all fun in games till this guy enslaves everyone I mean ever ever there were according to history there&amp;#39;s no such thing they just had really friendly friends and roomates fores for some reason cigarettes weird how that works up next a local called p is blowing speakers throughout the bay here&amp;#39;s their new single nothing wrong a pirate flag wonder if there&amp;#39;s treasure buried nearby no but your future ex-girlfriend will be to soon I know one fire that doesn&amp;#39;t need any poking PR fo no this is a vortex Club I wouldn&amp;#39;t mind joining got to love a place where even Christmas looks depressing this rug has some miles on it and I know it&amp;#39;s probably just so we can experience the world as our character but it&amp;#39;s kind of like really dawned upon me just how [ __ ] milk toast of a character [ __ ] Max was in the first game waffles there&amp;#39;s nothing else at this is no good that&amp;#39;s terrible what smile [ __ ] Twilight Vibes I did like it was interesting to see her kind of like get more confident grow into her like kind of find her personality but man was she just kind of like a blank slate and not in a good way I wonder if I&amp;#39;ll ever ride one of these again Max and I used to go there all the time as kids I think it shut down want to leave yet oh my gosh who knows American Rust sounds about right I feel like without the pirate she be even less

got a boot on it but like would it be better just fix that up instead of a shitty car never mind we&amp;#39;re thinking also strikes me as the kind of person that would just be like oh this one has character though this one&amp;#39;s got history it&amp;#39;s [ __ ] up just like me they threw a whole car out because they is start just changing the [ __ ] battery what what the [ __ ] hello why

stuff we not stealing from him oh there&amp;#39;s the paperoni hey there oh it&amp;#39;s a puppy a [ __ ] sorry P get up here why am I so mad right now who&amp;#39;s who was there for playthrough number one why am I so pissed right now why am I so [ __ ] furious yep he totally 100,000% mentions the dog name and if you guys were not privy for the first playthrough there&amp;#39;s a part in chapter 4 where there&amp;#39;s a fail State there&amp;#39;s a fail state that you can get in chapter 4 of the first game that you mentioned the dog&amp;#39;s name that you&amp;#39;re not supposed to know yet as Max and then he [ __ ] flips out going I never tell anybody my dog&amp;#39;s name how do you know that and he flips out and like shoots Chloe and then you have to rewind and it&amp;#39;s one of the most frustrating like parts of the first game when in reality ohlo knows the dog&amp;#39;s name Chloe realistically could have just told you the dog&amp;#39;s name which makes that entire scene literally [ __ ] not cannon at all well of course it&amp;#39;s not Cannon because like you don&amp;#39;t die you know he doesn&amp;#39;t actually shoot Chloe you get the right answer but like him freaking out is not plausible at all [Music] no no that&amp;#39;s not like it&amp;#39;s not possible at all like like homie just lies or it&amp;#39;s not a lie it&amp;#39;s just poor writing that was already dumb as [ __ ] the little killer that was already a dumb as [ __ ] point but now it&amp;#39;s made even worse except one of the two people here literally holy [ __ ] Ellie is so [ __ ]

Evan just call me intelligent damn straight wow Evan looks really ridiculous Chloe uh-huh I&amp;#39;ve learned something about myself recently something that I think you might understand I&amp;#39;ve learned that if I&amp;#39;m passionate about something it&amp;#39;s probably the right thing to care about forest fires for example you should have taken my petition seriously like anyone else did did you really expect people to care little people are so eager to pass on responsibility to anyone else so that they can live comfortable unworried and ultimately meaningless lives you see what happened looks like you were right go Evan you&amp;#39;re a hero of the people I know you feel like I do about different things I&amp;#39;m sure but you only give a [ __ ] about what you give a [ __ ] about I

easily the least exciting did after all the work Steph did it&amp;#39;s amazing that she would drop everything to be there for Mikey no hey Dana did Doug dig David&amp;#39;s Garden or did David dig Doug did Doug hell if I know the [ __ ] Doug dig sup Mr Katon sup why if it isn&amp;#39;t the Muse of the blackw drama Department tell me young lady do you still believe true love exists uh then us

of Stephanie an emergency she says who does he sound like you&amp;#39;re 100% right he definitely sounds like somebody from the first game but platitudinal though it may be The Show Must is this a so says Mr Stewart yes yes that&amp;#39;s who he sounds like weird it&amp;#39;s like you&amp;#39;re 100% right look like wait a minute this sounds Vaguely Familiar Chloe price presents firewor laser light spectacular walk with me not nearly as impressive as it appeared to be hey Hayden address me as Ferdinand good lady go [ __ ] yourself all right hey go [ __ ] yourself super lame Chloe I mean super lame Fair Maiden great method acting really thanks why submit the BL in is the game about to crash Oh no just [ __ ] hung there for like no reason why you bling in the corner hey Samantha Nathan please I can&amp;#39;t do it Dad I&amp;#39;m sorry keep your voice down now listen to me you don&amp;#39;t understand they all hate me they&amp;#39;re just going to laugh at me why do you suppose that is I don&amp;#39;t know because you show weakness just like your doing right now dad when will you learn that this isn&amp;#39;t about you and your problems this is about the Prescott name my name you will not embarrass me Nathan yes good now break a leg I&amp;#39;ll see you after the show how did he say that so o after all that would say something she&amp;#39;s so dumb great pep talk Mr P everyone knows the best way to instill confidence in someone is by intimidating them I don&amp;#39;t know who you are but mind your own business I&amp;#39;d love to don&amp;#39;t you have like a private bunker filled with gold coins where you could have these conversations Nathan [ __ ] he takes out that aggression on people hey Nathan&amp;#39;s dad is some [ __ ] huh I know I wish he&amp;#39;d just go away and leave him alone Nathan&amp;#39;s dad sucks but you should be careful what you wish for when it comes to parents oh Chloe I wasn&amp;#39;t thinking I&amp;#39;m sorry oh for what you didn&amp;#39;t kill my dad or did [Music] you that was a joke I know your dark sense of humor reminds me a lot of Nathan&amp;#39;s actually the two of you are really similar I don&amp;#39;t like that uh what the hell does that mean I&amp;#39;m serious you&amp;#39;re both artistic and surprisingly sensitive you&amp;#39;ve been through a lot and and a lot of people unfairly judge you for it I think you stood up for Nathan yesterday because you know what he&amp;#39;s going through okay listen why am I being psych why am I being psychologically but whenever I try to help him it always seems to make things worse if you were Ethan right now what would you want me to do um I get some space to cool down when I&amp;#39;m super angry I need to let it all out the last thing I want is someone trying to calm me down case in point how pissed he was when we tried to help him yesterday if I were you I&amp;#39;d give him space and wait for him to come to you that actually makes sense he was like stomping and yelling but like I you know stay out of the word path man do not [ __ ] with that do not look happy that answer though [ __ ] shaming SL lets shame themselves another Wy rebuttal by VC you wouldn&amp;#39;t know what you are I guess we enter the tent Rachel rockel oh come on V you got this v v you got this oh [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] I can&amp;#39;t do this I&amp;#39;m going to ruin the play

performance even though I wish I was the one performing tonight Victoria really am happy for you I hope it&amp;#39;s everything you want it to be we both do right Chloe uh okay so here&amp;#39;s the deal there is an opportunity here to like be mean to her and make her quit but this production is down its main star replaced with the shittier star and now the stage manager has gone to the hospital with Mikey and Drew so like while I don&amp;#39;t want Victoria to be successful I feel like there&amp;#39;s a lot of people who don&amp;#39;t deserve to suffer here that we can&amp;#39;t make worse at this point cuz I mean like I mean like we can but it&amp;#39;s like I feel like that&amp;#39;s really mean to the other people who didn&amp;#39;t ask for this you know if that weren&amp;#39;t a part of it already doomed what what does it help to make it more doomed oh [ __ ] I&amp;#39;m sorry yeah I guess I mean even even if you are super lame to me all the time I hope you don&amp;#39;t completely suck up there and even if you do suck who cares I mean let&amp;#39;s be real you&amp;#39;re not Rachel but that&amp;#39;s okay because you&amp;#39;re Victoria Chase Victoria Victoria even

that on stage yeah right you no you like seriously I love nights after a show is it always like this my Converse look like that now they&amp;#39;re all beat up and ruined no more nerves just the adrenaline ad are you proud of yourself you were literally perfect tonight I was blown away I&amp;#39;m happy but I&amp;#39;m still worried about Mikey and Drew and where I&amp;#39;m going tonight and all that you&amp;#39;ve gone through so much [ __ ] today right now is pretty good they we going to kiss right there okay the whole show was good I admit it yeah it was magical like both their heads tilted at the same time I thought they were done they were like done for usually I&amp;#39;m like be gay do crime but maybe be gay and do crime with someone else okay Max is much better for you let&amp;#39;s leave for real for real huh you said you wanted to skip town and never look back like I said last night let&amp;#39;s do it I know I&amp;#39;ve been thinking about that all day but that was don&amp;#39;t say it was just a crazy thought you mean it I can tell you want this yeah but like eventually let&amp;#39;s go now didn&amp;#39;t we already agree on stage we can&amp;#39;t just why not I know our parents have been shitty but we can&amp;#39;t just leave them not poor Joyce sound like Chloe price yeah my mom dude but I&amp;#39;m the only one my mom has left you&amp;#39;re right what am I saying she got David now how far could we possibly get without a car I thought you were fixing that truck in the junkyard I was just seeing if I could well can you or can&amp;#39;t you maybe it&amp;#39;s not like I do this all the time you&amp;#39;ll figure it out but you don&amp;#39;t even know what shape it&amp;#39;s in I don&amp;#39;t need to because I know you and I know what you&amp;#39;re capable of in other words we&amp;#39;ve got Transportation covered I&amp;#39;m like live watching somebody be gaslighted manipulated into like doing something terrible for their life and like honestly it&amp;#39;s one of the saddest things that has happened in the entire Series so far I know the other things are like way more dramatic but this is like heart-wrenching in like a really really real way like it&amp;#39;s not like oh I have a a dead relative or oh this really tragic thing happened like no this is like real life [ __ ] that people do to each other and to watch it happen in lifetime to Chloe like it&amp;#39;s so [ __ ] up and it&amp;#39;s just uncomfortable to sit through it&amp;#39;s very uncomfortable to sit through like you just want to step in and like like hey no no no you can&amp;#39;t you just got to like watch it happen it&amp;#39;s really upsetting what about money I thought you were a high rolling criminal now nah I didn&amp;#39;t like being a criminal as much as I thought you&amp;#39;re more of a here then I think you realize I think you&amp;#39;re higher now that&amp;#39;s what people do to in this situation is they like they gas you up to get what they want see anyway I&amp;#39;ve got more than enough to they fill your head up with all these things to make you feel good so you&amp;#39;ll do all these things or should I say hush money any more questions and there&amp;#39;s no option to not there&amp;#39;s no option to not wow that&amp;#39;s rough buddy that&amp;#39;s really really rough actually a honey you were just heard ticket out of this place and you just have the means to do it like she don&amp;#39;t care about you like that which is probably why you know we find out in life of strange one that she end up moving on to Frank when she got what she wanted or realized that Chloe wasn&amp;#39;t going to give her what she wanted you know like we&amp;#39;ll play the rest of the game and figure out maybe that&amp;#39;s where the turn happened yeah that&amp;#39;s fire and I were on the exact same thought process minus stream delay like she just bounced whoever she could use there no potential too the situation no because like all of this that&amp;#39;s happening is canonical to life is strange one right like Rachel and Chloe being a thing wanting to run away together that&amp;#39;s all stuff that&amp;#39;s established in life strange one and this is a prequel so that stuff has to happen and chlo&amp;#39;s is such a vulnerable place CU she doesn&amp;#39;t have a support Network she doesn&amp;#39;t have a support system well she kind of does she has Steph and probably should have talked to Steph about it Mikey sort of OT doesn&amp;#39;t give a [ __ ] either so she&amp;#39;s easily manipulative because she can&amp;#39;t like tell her story to a lot of people about what&amp;#39;s happening [ __ ] up fine then drama queen where are we going you tell me what uniquely Twisted location does Chloe Price Plus Rachel Amber equal so we&amp;#39;re in Oregon Los Angeles is probably the most why don&amp;#39;t you show me La perfect 60° every night you and me on the Santa Monica Pier gorging on food truck food smoking up it is it is really good so you know excellent on the waves and a beautiful blond man will sit next to us and smile at you yeah okay he&amp;#39;ll say I like your eyes and I&amp;#39;ll say back off she&amp;#39;s with me you&amp;#39;re full of [ __ ] I love this time of night don&amp;#39;t you just feel like everything&amp;#39;s possible Rachel stop if you don&amp;#39;t mean this it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s just making me feel like [ __ ] that this life you&amp;#39;re describing isn&amp;#39;t going to happen for [ __ ] sake I&amp;#39;ve never been more serious in my life Chloe what would it take to convince you it&amp;#39;s so funny that in the context of like when we first started this play through we like yeah kiss yeah kiss now we&amp;#39;re like [ __ ] man stay keep your lips as far away from that human is [ __ ] possible I don&amp;#39;t I don&amp;#39;t want to be convinced and it&amp;#39;s kind of unavoidable unfortunately but I like I don&amp;#39;t want to be convinced me in the driver&amp;#39;s seat kill people with their wi wi open just get out of the way or get locked yeah I don&amp;#39;t oh man I guess we just do have to just kind of be at the driver&amp;#39;s seat or driver seat is the passenger seat rather that&amp;#39;s [ __ ] C [ __ ] Torpedoes the [ __ ] out of this is really sad um I mean she&amp;#39;s just drinking

not even a single Cheeto stuck in this thing play was bad enough without having to read about it afterwards hope Drew is okay though H how to clear browser history followed by a gap for all of

district attorney huh I&amp;#39;m your district attorney so I can call you if I&amp;#39;m ever District arrested what would you be arrested for it was a joke not a good one clearly what do you think I thought Rachel was doesn&amp;#39;t like him she certainly was we&amp;#39;re very proud of her I had no idea they were going to do that do what I don&amp;#39;t know the name for it reverse casting casting a woman as a man oh no into this I just meant the wizard part ah I suppose that&amp;#39;s also true say don&amp;#39;t get into this [ __ ] please your daughter&amp;#39;s pretty great thank you

somehow Amber mhm I don&amp;#39;t know how he landed one how did he end up with [ __ ] two H you know that&amp;#39;s you know that is the correct answer easy to see who wears the literary pants around here guess some families actually go to Paris instead of just talk about it their whole lives hey she was wearing that shirt holy [ __ ] that&amp;#39;s the guy who attacked Drew and I&amp;#39;m holding on to a grand of his money Rachel and I couldn&amp;#39;t guy tried to beat us up GP spe that&amp;#39;s [ __ ] alessa&amp;#39;s last name from Silent [Music] Hill Francis his name is Frank all right honey we got to raise your standards that guy&amp;#39;s hot look at him again holy [ __ ] that&amp;#39;s theud he looks [ __ ] CED out like face is so [ __ ] shrunken in I could [ __ ] do a light off his [ __ ] cheekbones soon that&amp;#39;s your hottie or we need to up the prescription on your glasses at least discount Stark how many cabinets do you need good question everything about this house is nicer cleaner better and more expensive than mine which isn&amp;#39;t saying much but still oh I think that&amp;#39;s an original who gives a [ __ ] I like those but not as internal monologues insult for people save that one Chloe you can you can unload on something for that Rachel and I both had great childhoods mine just ended a little before hers I guess what your puzzle improve [Music] literal illiterate what what do you mean finish the cross word don&amp;#39;t [ __ ] it up you dip solved it wait what what what do you mean there&amp;#39;s no puzzle to which swords isn&amp;#39;t the solution okay whatever weirdo so clean I bet Rose would kill it with my mom at the diner if I open this will skeletons come spilling [Music] out something about this photo doesn&amp;#39;t seem right I should fix it can&amp;#39;t tag this while Rachel&amp;#39;s mom is right there D she totally bust me look at draw my little mustache hey there Mrs Amber hey there Chloe I&amp;#39;m so glad you&amp;#39;re joining us tonight are you going kill me and like scrape my eyeballs out like why you looking at me like that so Rachel was pretty awesome tonight she sure was and I imagine whatever trick the two of you pulled to get her back on stage was even more dramatic than the play we can be very persuasive together you almost [ __ ] killed a person yes that&amp;#39;s a word for it I get the sense that you&amp;#39;re a force of nature yourself I can see why the two of you get along so well you can cuz it still seems crazy to me yeah what did you think of the play Rachel was typically amazing but I never liked the Tempest what did you think okay everybody&amp;#39;s a [ __ ] critic to be honest I only really read a couple Pages theater is not really my thing I guess I&amp;#39;m not so into saying words someone else came up with fa point then again I&amp;#39;m not sure you can judge the entire Reading Writing on the dead white men your curriculum focuses on damn shots fired Shakespeare I talk about reading versus writing I I get really into writing but reading alsoa Integrity honesty loyalty what it&amp;#39;s on your lawn oh right sorry I guess I&amp;#39;m still getting used to being an elected official&amp;#39;s wife what&amp;#39;s it like being married to the DA much like like being married to anyone else I imagine but with a lot more secrets right Secrets like attorney client privilege and all that well as district attorney he brings cases against criminals on behalf of the state he doesn&amp;#39;t defend them of course not so you putting me said what yes if you could please take four plates from the cupboard and set them on the table uh what if I can&amp;#39;t excuse me you said if I could never mind you&amp;#39;re so dry a riot Chloe she understood the joke and chose not to laugh like what a [ __ ] sociopath of it was just like good one like what a [ __ ] psychopath man sociopath not psychopath [ __ ] freaky hello glasses damn the ambers are fancy as [ __ ] like Wesker would do that that joke was very funny just about his no skeletons lots of shiny dishes though I feel like you can tell what social class you&amp;#39;re in based on if you have these little lights under your [ __ ] cabinets or not so found that out there play I better be say most Heroes too oh it&amp;#39;s to the table with you it looks like a Deborah not a rose just throwing that out there I like that joke earli Burger all King one just called me were you in a play tonight I would have liked to see that kind of just happened last minute I&amp;#39;m glad you&amp;#39;re doing well nice to see tonight are you coming home please I miss you all just be like hey I&amp;#39;m having dinner with the ambers and I&amp;#39;ll be right home after that text her back you whatever Lights Under the cabinets yeah you don&amp;#39;t you don&amp;#39;t have these little bitsin lights under your cabinets one those things that like separates your social class you know yes are you rich enough to put lights under your cabinets and not the little ones you just stick under there you get from Walmart plates check anything else actually could you be a deer and ask Mr Amber what he&amp;#39;d like to drink with dinner I will be a deer talking to James as long as I can avoid using the word and scumbag I should be fine that sounds like I&amp;#39;m not I&amp;#39;m not qualified to answer that question I&amp;#39;m just going to go with that I&amp;#39;m not qualified to answer that question what&amp;#39;s your Vice Mr Amber I&amp;#39;m sorry your wife wants to know what kind of Dre I you have so much content if you want to animate Wesker stuff for me dude I am on that [ __ ] every time we play that character like nonstop Sherry comical comic call Chloe another whis understand something I&amp;#39;ll give it a shot comic call Rose and I we&amp;#39;re worried about Rachel yesterday was so unlike her what do you suppose is going on like a [ __ ] robot he seem like [ __ ] tilting his head like I&amp;#39;m not the [ __ ] Predator man oh don&amp;#39;t don&amp;#39;t bring up the besides you thing sorry it&amp;#39;s all my bad behavior rubbing off on her you mean h another joke you tell me it seemed like you and Wells were happy to believe that this morning Rachel is her own person she&amp;#39;s responsible for her actions I&amp;#39;d be lying if I said I didn&amp;#39;t have concerns about your friendship but perhaps you&amp;#39;re exactly who Rachel needs right now as she navigates the choppy Waters of adolescence now she navigates the choppy Waters of adolescence than okay Albert Wesker can you [ __ ] chill we ever figure out what he want to drink something else duty calls good chat Mr Amber mhm back to contemplating my complete Global saturation okay buddy you [ __ ] relax there man yeah why are you okay yes Chloe the boss man would like a Sherry thank you the glasses are in the China cabinet you can place one at his setting how am I supposed to get to China kidding it&amp;#39;s the fancy looking cabinet right you got it just so uncomfortable uh it&amp;#39;s the triangle shaped one basic shapes now you&amp;#39;re speaking my language put it at the head of the table and the head of the table what did she just do did she just wipe her ass with it what the [ __ ] did you just do what was that we going talk about that yes Chloe what else feel like I&amp;#39;m getting good at this only one last step as our guest you may do the honor of lighting the candles the lighter is in the it&amp;#39;s cool I&amp;#39;ve got my own oh you never know when you&amp;#39;ll need to light a candle right you are a paragon of preparedness I think what a [ __ ] s light some candles and L this joint up a bit everyone feels awesome I did see that on your Twitter it&amp;#39;s very very exciting that&amp;#39;s a sign of a like any well-designed game it&amp;#39;s like you want to play everybody you know everybody feels fun or interesting in some way it&amp;#39;s a lack of character disparity it&amp;#39;s like the big fancy way to talk about lack of character disparity between characters so awkward uh boy so Chloe are you and Rachel in any of the same classes I wish Rachel&amp;#39;s all honors I&amp;#39;m still trying to get into remedial what&amp;#39;s it called vocabulary what about that fire dinner&amp;#39;s really good Mom thank you Rich if you really think about it half the people at this table [ __ ] die fairly soon kind of Haunting the way the fire spreads so fast I&amp;#39;ve never heard of anything like it it&amp;#39;s strange life is strange it&amp;#39;s almost surreal they say a fire like that could only come from a crime of passion why would you say that chloee passion what does that mean I don&amp;#39;t know you tell me what the [ __ ] Chloe you&amp;#39;re the da of course it&amp;#39;s certainly troubling the latest report from the Commissioner&amp;#39;s Office suggests arson arson why would anyone do that no our daughter you&amp;#39;ll know a daughter not a son no everything going on in the world today even a town like Arcadia Bay isn&amp;#39;t immune to the ills of societ I hary I canot imagine how difficult these last few years have been for you Chloe now that you and Rachel have become friends I want you to know that our home is always open to you cool thanks well said dear it&amp;#39;s imperative in such troubled times as these that we remember what is most important to us family family&amp;#39;s not not merely a gift it is a responsibility as such those we love must be cared for and never ever taken for granted I don&amp;#39;t think attacking James is the time for [Music] this uh family family that&amp;#39;s super true and also remember Rachel that even when shit&amp;#39;s like the lamest ever you can can always run away from whatever is bothering you as long as you just keep calm an interesting philosophy Chloe yes indeed not one that I would endorse however I favor confronting my problems head on it&amp;#39;s called divorcing you [ __ ] cheating [ __ ] anyways but to each their own I suppose oh [ __ ] blow me Rachel I am uncomfortable I&amp;#39;m secondhand [Music] embarrassed explain ah it&amp;#39;s not for me to explain but I don&amp;#39;t want to distract either I guess I&amp;#39;ll distract crap I&amp;#39;m so clumsy Rachel can you come help me find another stop Chloe oh no I can&amp;#39;t sit here and listen to this [ __ ] anymore Rachel stop it Dad you&amp;#39;re a hypocrite okay I know you lying cheating piece of [ __ ] [ __ ] excuse me we saw you yesterday at the over what do mean we why do got to get me involved kissing that woman James Rachel honey whatever you saw or think you saw Global infidelity you trust me uh I look like a God-fearing man I&amp;#39;ll never be graceful friend shows the yeah it&amp;#39;s [ __ ] awkward it&amp;#39;s [ __ ] you want to serious you want to see something you&amp;#39;re never going to see wait till it pans back to his shirt there&amp;#39;s a seam in his collar that goes stra right through his body there&amp;#39;s like a little line look at it right by his button look at that [ __ ] look at that [ __ ] now you&amp;#39;re never going to see it if I have to suffer by looking at it so to [ __ ] you make you look at it one more time just for Prosperity sake there you go think we saw are you trying to Gaslight us there&amp;#39;s no thinking inv we saw you locking lips with some other woman best part is she and I use the same drug dealer why would you say that that&amp;#39;s enough you are not welcome here or around my daughter any longer I know exactly what kind of person you are from the moment I saw you and I let my wife&amp;#39;s compassion get the better of you oh what kind of person is that a delinquent a broken girl from a broken home that&amp;#39;s enough James I will not have you continue to oh no oh my gosh oh my gosh e e e e e e yeah how is she better I just realized that they showed her just being angry at the poster but she totally passed out is she just okay we&amp;#39;re not going to talk about that just kind of like wow interesting okay but like my question is like okay so like my question is like I get that that&amp;#39;s her the mother of this kid but like you don&amp;#39;t if you&amp;#39;re you divorced or like even if they were never married if you if you married somebody new you don&amp;#39;t you don&amp;#39;t [ __ ] kiss your [ __ ] you don&amp;#39;t [ __ ] kiss you the ex person you don&amp;#39;t don&amp;#39;t [ __ ] do that like what reason is that for for that you took the blame for most people took the blame for Rachel why I just go along with their plan why would you do that most people emptied their pockets really that&amp;#39;s interesting most people stay with Mikey most people ask for a kiss that does surprise me why do most people want to go to the play with Elliott Elliot&amp;#39;s a weirdo oh I didn&amp;#39;t even find that damn thing oh the money I could have stole at the beginning of the game I could used to off Frank I see gotcha yeah it&amp;#39;s a skill issue see this is a whole other thing it&amp;#39;s like this is a big thing this part right here that that telling her that it was single like technically we&amp;#39;re not in a relationship we&amp;#39;re doing all this like this super committal [ __ ] and running away we&amp;#39;re still in a situationship like like all of this [ __ ] and Rachel still hasn&amp;#39;t committed to us in any way she perform she is not committed to us whatsoever which is a huge ginormous [ __ ] no pun intended flaming red flag that is like the biggest reddest flag Crimson in front of a bull that could ever possibly exist all of this that she&amp;#39;s getting out of [ __ ] Chloe and they&amp;#39;re not even technically dating that [ __ ] is [ __ ] wild return Mone most people didn&amp;#39;t do that it&amp;#39;s interesting you didn&amp;#39;t give him some we were just like yeah [ __ ] that guy yeah you like literally it&amp;#39;s all with this is all happening with one week Z know you were right about that this is all happening within one week probably not even five days unless I&amp;#39;m missing something most people confronted her huh must with Los Angeles interesting interesting no no no we&amp;#39;re if I do another like 3 or 4 Hour episode we&amp;#39;ll be here until like 4 in the morning actually yes they never really go across path before yeah so like they&amp;#39;re getting all of that she has done all of that and they&amp;#39;re not even together that&amp;#39;s [ __ ] terrifying that is UN ironically spooky like there&amp;#39;s nothing committ between them but like she&amp;#39;s expecting so much out of her or well kind of not expecting it but just like demanding it like there is no other option and she&amp;#39;s just kind of going along cuz like this probably the first time in forever that like you know she&amp;#39;s obviously like her mom is is split between her and her new you know her boyfriend so she&amp;#39;s not giving that overwhelming love so she&amp;#39;s just kind of like taking advantage of how lonely Bo feels which is not good wow that is just and like I know honest to you like Prouds for the game for going there cuz that&amp;#39;s like a such a like a really intense and like upsetting topic I was that here like yes you may ruin my life for what may or may not be a relationship hey you unfortunately know I relate you you unfortunately know that I I have also been there as much as I I hate that I have been I have unfortunately been there yeah it&amp;#39;s very bold in the game to go that direction cuz I feel like uh in general a lot of people don&amp;#39;t get that like a lot of people have not uh a lot of people are still in that spot to be to be frank a lot of reason it boils down to is a lot of people are still in that spot so they don&amp;#39;t see it as bad yeah a lot of people are still in that spot so they don&amp;#39;t necessarily see it bad or like want to like call it out so it&amp;#39;s kind of I don&amp;#39;t know it&amp;#39;s kind of really bold and mature of the game to go there especially considering how like the relationship was kind of painted in the last game in the first game it was kind of painted like you know kind of idealistically and you kind of Wonder like like the true character of of of of Rachel Amber because you&amp;#39;re like okay so Chloe and her had a like a serious thing going on and then she just kind of like randomly leaves from some other dude and then she just kind of [ __ ] disappears and you kind of Wonder like did she disappear on purpose instead of being you know mortared I&amp;#39;m starting to wonder that again is like did she disappear and then get murdered again like did she actually like leave leave you [Music] know um so I don&amp;#39;t know I so far if I if that has not been obvious this is very excellent very very excellent I vastly prefer this to the first game vastly prefer this to the first game the dialogue is better the character work is better the situations are like everything everything&amp;#39;s just better and I you know what&amp;#39;s funny I do prefer the time mechanic over the uh the the the dialogue mechanic but honestly I don&amp;#39;t find myself missing it too much if anything",

it&amp;#39;s weird that the Ang Diner is like kind of a a point in the story we&amp;#39;ve come to many times but it do have its own safe point which is kind of interesting maybe it does inside maybe might be worth looking into this game is it&amp;#39;s Deli premonition it&amp;#39;s not reverse GTA it&amp;#39;s uh it&amp;#39;s more based on like Twin Peaks there&amp;#39;s a there&amp;#39;s a girl that was murdered and we&amp;#39;re trying to solve the mystery of it but we can run around and do side quests and like help the towns people and stuff like that too yeah it&amp;#39;s got that going for I know I know it&amp;#39;s not time yet 2100 right [Music] I gu the game is paused but the game is not paused technically time is technically passing in the background oh I&amp;#39;m very hungry I am very hungry oh boy kind a little EP we do the coffee for the the EP wa a can I pickles for Hunger need to get more reserves in terms of coffee and food [Music] oh hello [Music] hi well then Olivia talked to me yes in the beginning Nick only went to the gallery during the day but he went so often at some point he became friendly with Diane they started going out drinking together and now he doesn&amp;#39;t come home until early morning yeah always says that they were only drinking when I ask sure he blames me for not being able to talk about Turner and rembrand which of course I can&amp;#39;t can I so what can I say finally I couldn&amp;#39;t take it anymore so I followed him he did go to the bar to start with Diane was there too but the real problem is where they go to next right yeah so I waited outside the bar to see where they might go and and they eventually left the bar and headed for the art gallery but it was it was already early morning but it was still dark just before going inside Diane turned around it should have been too dark to see me but I swear all right restate you looked right at me they seemed have flash for a moment I was so rattled that I left and went home the next day Anna was found dead I I didn&amp;#39;t know what to do [Music] that real for me go for it I went to the gallery to talk with Diane about it to confront her once I was there I couldn&amp;#39;t find the courage to go through with it then I saw you there and I just felt I had to go home Nick has been seeing Diane every night recently he just left for tonight too I I I really don&amp;#39;t know what to do dork we had to take Nick in for questioning no not yet this alone isn&amp;#39;t enough Emily answer me this is Emily agent York is with me too I&amp;#39;ve just received word from Thomas at the Sheriff&amp;#39;s Department something has happened at Becky&amp;#39;s house it was called in by Quinn but he wasn&amp;#39;t making any sense we have no further details hey Kent Thomas you can you go back him up yes sir one other thing it sounded like he said rainco Killer looks so good it does be related to the murder case take all due precautions no it couldn&amp;#39;t be Nick please I don&amp;#39;t think they killed her I think there&amp;#39;s just like I said in twins Peaks Twin Peaks it&amp;#39;s like Olivia calm down just cuz you&amp;#39;re cheating on your wife doesn&amp;#39;t make you a murderer I&amp;#39;m head over to of a newborn house l h everybody lives on a big house by the lake apparently I just hope this isn&amp;#39;t anything serious damn it Zach we may have screwed up during the inv you better hurry Zach I have a bad feeling about this Becky&amp;#39;s house is by the lake like dead ins theide I was just thinking that while looking at him good to see fire hopefully you&amp;#39;re well can relate well them well then this doesn&amp;#39;t go where I need to go interesting even without looking at the map I&amp;#39;m kind of like starting to be like no that doesn&amp;#39;t go where it needs to go that goes somewhere else getting slowly used to it what whoa what just happened hello what happened to my car it popped a wheelie as a vehicle was a full four-wheel vehicle this is the only time in the game I&amp;#39;ve actually appropriately used my siren rest have not been good uses of went what did I hit wait did I just hit thin air there&amp;#39;s nothing there what the [ __ ] [Music] yeah know you think I would go faster than 55 mil an hour somebody&amp;#39;s life was in Peril but oh evidently not got to respect the laws of the road while somebody&amp;#39;s in like eminent danger I guess I wonder this is a very very odd question I Wonder Why games don&amp;#39;t do Thunder properly like why does lightning and thunder happen at the same time like what is what stops games from having the lightning Flash and thunder coming later is that just like too difficult or something like am I missing something I knows most games do that they just do lightning up under at the same time but it doesn&amp;#39;t work that way gosh this lady that&amp;#39;s extremely far away Becky is gone I&amp;#39;m coming oh my gosh what was that go go go ohy I&amp;#39;m sorry that&amp;#39;s all he would say since I got here Quint tell what did you see in there did you see the raincoat killer she&amp;#39;s dead Thomas did you see Nick here no when I got here he was already like that should be here soon call George to get over here and wait out here why isor here once they both get here follow George&amp;#39;s orders okay yeah how did we beet George here but agent York isn&amp;#39;t it dangerous to go in there alone yeah how did we be George here is he the one that called it in that&amp;#39;s weird Zack let me smoke on first I need to clear my head so I can take everything in oh no always one of those Masters up there we have to kill a bunch of things yeah we&amp;#39;re in the Silent Hill section this still hasn&amp;#39;t been explained what this is and why we see it apparently we can enter it at will but sometimes it feels involuntary at the same time let&amp;#39;s hope it&amp;#39;s not a big welcoming party oh hello he&amp;#39;s already here no no no okay why it open so slowly I asking me to clean my inventory even though I&amp;#39;ve eaten all the food and drink that I have there&amp;#39;s still not space in there somehow know how that I don&amp;#39;t know what the deal is there there&amp;#39;s nothing in what is this music Zach that&amp;#39;s a strange coincidence look red velvet just like the place where Anna was murdered oh we&amp;#39;re going to start doing this I I interesting too much noise we&amp;#39;re still missing a vital piece of the puzzle yeah you think [Music] so I don&amp;#39;t know why it gives us the suit option sometimes if we can&amp;#39;t even interact with the menu it does that sometimes for like no reason like I even have it don&amp;#39;t want to die well this is where I just came out of yeah okay so that&amp;#39;s locked not even possible to open that get rid of these real quick would sound like they&amp;#39;re right here would they&amp;#39;re not oh [ __ ] oh [ __ ] oh [ __ ] oh [ __ ] oh [ __ ] oh [ __ ] oh [ __ ] there&amp;#39;s more oh wait there&amp;#39;s more we don&amp;#39;t really need the 10 mm bullets anymore there they oh my God oh my God she&amp;#39;s on fire oh she killed herself going to the fire that&amp;#39;s cute that&amp;#39;s funny so don&amp;#39;t step in that at the right time yeah cuz like right as the story starting to get a little too monotonous [ __ ] oh [ __ ] oh [ __ ] [ __ ] there&amp;#39;s a little section where you&amp;#39;re just kind of like have one these little Sil Hill moments are we good no all right auto lock that one how many of these are there hello how many are these things this just infinite okay I think they&amp;#39;re just infinite so I&amp;#39;m just going to I can&amp;#39;t even get by you I can&amp;#39;t even get by you that&amp;#39;s interesting why were they just infinite like that oh boy a donut just a crispy Silent Hill donut be that safety right hello again Apple eat that crispy Silent Hill donut you stuff your face it says Ray is raing me raing me raing meing meing me thanks much for the raid friend I appreciate that how was your stream hello OJ hi private how are we friends how&amp;#39;s our Saturday treating us Chaser hello welcome in friend we&amp;#39;re just playing some Deadly Premonition is a very very quirky but very very fun game y Chaser you have the follow I appreciate that though thank you let me grab this for you real quick let me get you set up here with the all the shout outs and cool stuff hope your stream is good I very much appreciate you trust me with your pupo lollipop cool actually like like I said earlier one of the things we could have done before we actually entered this section was uh do food things like get more food and coffee because we are out of mobile supplies stream thank you very much appreciate that we have no reason to pick those up anymore since we have the special special uh submachine gun what in the Spencer Mansion am I looking at [Music] here I hate that noise so much I wish they would not put those at that noise at serious points Reserve peace sign okay I&amp;#39;m not going to here we&amp;#39;ll do it but we&amp;#39;re just going to skip it until it&amp;#39;s uh yeah yeah we&amp;#39;re going to we&amp;#39;ll do the profiling but we&amp;#39;re going to wait until uh they music playing until we have all the evidence so we don&amp;#39;t have to see the same thing 13 times that&amp;#39;s just what I&amp;#39;ve realized is that uh what I realized is those um doing the profiling is kind of pointless until you get uh all them together once you get them all together you&amp;#39;re good red seed I don&amp;#39;t like I don&amp;#39;t like that you look so ominous in that look from that camera angle um can I take my gun out please thank you I much as I like that the combat is easy I kind of wish was a little more difficult just a little bit more cuz at this point it&amp;#39;s like besides some instances where like they kind of gang up on you and it gets a little dicey and I do mean the little keyword little um there&amp;#39;s not really much to be afraid of hey Bella it&amp;#39;s good to see you friend game is pretty good we were just talking about a little bit of the the combat cues probably a little bit more difficulty to it I would say cuz most combat encounters are complete pushovers whereas if um there&amp;#39;s a little bit more grit to them I think would be the word might be a little bit more fun there&amp;#39;s the boy like it can be easy it&amp;#39;s still like a challenge here there not break through that see you yeah oh one of those hiding sections so with a 10 mm so so with a 10 mm submachine gun we&amp;#39;re not going to just blow this guy into the next Dimension why are we hiding from him like we could we could theoretically just blow them to bits right I don&amp;#39;t know why we hide oh don&amp;#39;t don&amp;#39;t check over here I&amp;#39;m in here oh thank goodness you guys there stamina is building up while inside this uh spot is that because like we&amp;#39;re holding our breath is that why that&amp;#39;s happening I just now notic that yeah he lit has an Axe and we have a we have a submachine gun I think I think I win this encounter if we if we come to blows you know what I&amp;#39;m saying I think I win oh sorry almost missed that was this cool jacket hey cozy it&amp;#39;s been while friend hope you&amp;#39;ve been well that&amp;#39;s the killer the guy we&amp;#39;re trying to catch but right now we&amp;#39;re hiding from him cuz he&amp;#39;s trying to kill us who come in here oh he just wait is that not where I&amp;#39;m hiding dude he checked the one to my right and not to my left where I&amp;#39;m actually hiding was so unfortunate for him my jacket it&amp;#39;s just a dam jacket it&amp;#39;s just a normal D jacket I appreciate that though wait he just has another axe wait wait he just threw that and then what huh why did he why did he throw that and then just have another one Zach this is a waste of time let&amp;#39;s go why he says something the Killer is right there don&amp;#39;t want to die I don&amp;#39;t think you will chocolate chip cookie poog that&amp;#39;s my mom that explains a lot about you what is this new ammo assault rifle you get an assault rifle at some point interesting what the the [ __ ] was that hello what was screaming oh hi how are you fancy meeting you here oh it&amp;#39;s one of these on rail sections so if we have a I still I know it&amp;#39;s probably not worth mentioning but like why why do I have a subm machine gun I&amp;#39;m just kind of letting him bully me I should be able to just like beat him up right oh hi he knew the shortcut he&amp;#39;s cheating wait what I don&amp;#39;t think he was that close was he what you get over that thank you PS2 error is the PS3 error actually R beer pog I&amp;#39;m sure she&amp;#39;s fine I&amp;#39;m sure she&amp;#39;s alive totally not dead okay now we can watch the whole profiling thing cuz we have every single piece of evidence stop please amazing wa thought that&amp;#39; be way more than that what the heck I thought that was hair or something I got a little worried I was like is there just like redhair person or something it&amp;#39;s bad very bad Zach the rainco killer gave Becky a visit oh are you back in real life hold on oh yeah it is really bad is it no it&amp;#39;s a shower you goober AER Zack the bathroom quick interesting I can&amp;#39;t take that seriously M rated hey Jason good to see you friend how are you today oh I can&amp;#39;t take it seriously without music oh she&amp;#39;s alive holy [ __ ] Zack she&amp;#39;s still alive who did this who was it Becky get her down from there Becky what happened here George stay back she&amp;#39;s trying to speak well if her Tong&amp;#39;s out like the other one she&amp;#39;s dying Thomas cut that wire we must get her to the hospital immediately what are you doing get out of the way I&amp;#39;ll do it no don&amp;#39;t George stop oh no [Music] it was a trap this is really sad [Music] I&amp;#39;ve heard this song somewhere else that&amp;#39;s not this game and I can&amp;#39;t I don&amp;#39;t remember why [Music] what yeah crying to the man that caused all this to happen fanasy song it does sound like it doesn&amp;#39;t it you got us good this time Zach [Music] pgy has been killed she wasn&amp;#39;t killed you killed her you don&amp;#39;t seem very broken up about it either why did he have actual noises what a hell he did I don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s Emily cuz every person we&amp;#39;ve seen killing has been a so sorry unless the accomplice is not the one killing at all for a man like him I don&amp;#39;t have the words to apologize to Anna well that&amp;#39;s cool I left her there she was suffering so much and I just ran away that was a good transition I like that I knew he wanted to kill me too but I&amp;#39;m not going to let him get away with this I followed him after he was finished he carried Anna into the woods Anna was holding on to that precious locket of his he couldn&amp;#39;t remove it from never seen dead but she let go of it for me though it was like she gave it to me so I brought it home I might be able to bring Anna&amp;#39;s killer down with it I want you to see it I know even he wouldn&amp;#39;t dare to harm you he&amp;#39;ll catch me though if I go into town I&amp;#39;m trapped in my house so I&amp;#39;ve asked Isaac and Isaiah to deliver it they totally believe that Anna became a goddess I believe so too she looked so beautiful as though she might smile back at any moment I have something else to confess to you I borrowed a pair of your shoes without asking and broke the heel on one of them I&amp;#39;ll send them along with the locket I&amp;#39;m sure the shoe can be fixed so Becky is Miss stiletto heel M and she gave the locket to the twins must be the special secret Lily told us about Zach we better go and see her first thing tomorrow Emily who might sister be that Becky was referring to here that would be Diane didn&amp;#39;t you know Diane and Becky were sisters I should have known Zack we&amp;#39;re all family here hey you could have just checked last names you goober ass like me watching this game what was that exactly why is Francis here is this present day is this a flashback interesting so Francis was possibly there the day of but so&amp;#39;s back [Music] here so walk with me here walk with me here so Francis is a traveling sapling salesman right like that&amp;#39;s his thing is he travels around the nation selling saplings or sapling seeds um he has a dog who fetches evidence or steals evidence and also he like we we we covered at the beginning of this like the whole reason that yor is on this case is because murders like this have happened before and he&amp;#39;s been tracking this killer for a while trying to find them and they&amp;#39;ve been killing people in small towns like across the nation and Francis travels around the for his Jobe so that&amp;#39;s very suspicious I don&amp;#39;t know if that makes Becky the other killer the other accomplice and like she&amp;#39;s but I I I could have it&amp;#39;s I could have swore it probably was somebody like mulling in the police to help him cover up the evidence but maybe that&amp;#39;s just the dog the dog&amp;#39;s going to just getting rid of evidence then like maybe that is but like how does he never get caught cuz you need like forensics and stuff to do that or maybe I&amp;#39;m overthinking it for a silly game but it is a murder mystery show I should um it was weird that this guy&amp;#39;s name that I can&amp;#39;t [ __ ] ever remember Thomas yeah Thomas was already at the scene where I got there and despite the fact that uh despite the fact that um despite the fact that George called it in George got there last so I don&amp;#39;t I don&amp;#39;t like these two I think Emily is like not in it or if she isn&amp;#39;t it&amp;#39;s a very minor way she&amp;#39;s not like the accomplice so to speak um [Music] so right JK now I&amp;#39;m literally literally trying to like piece this together cuz it seems like the game is kind of like red hairing us with Diane and really really trying to get us to be like oh Diane did it you know but I think that&amp;#39;s a red herring to throw us off she may be involved but I don&amp;#39;t think she&amp;#39;s actually doing the killings she may be aware of them and not doing nothing or no more than she&amp;#39;s letting on I don&amp;#39;t think she&amp;#39;s actually murdering [Music] anybody makes you think think makes you think I don&amp;#39;t think Nick and cuz like it&amp;#39;s not like Nick and dianae are doing anything illegal they&amp;#39;re just being shitty by you know like you know cheating right like they&amp;#39;re not they&amp;#39;re not murderers for doing that so Dian might be a shitty person but I don&amp;#39;t think that necessarily makes her like that doesn&amp;#39;t make her a murderer you know so I think this is a lot of this is coming from like if you&amp;#39;re or like what he&amp;#39;s pulling that out of his ass it&amp;#39;s like this is this is heavily based on Twin Peaks obviously even if the Creator says they Haden seen it it&amp;#39;s like and that&amp;#39;s like another that&amp;#39;s the thing that&amp;#39;s funny about that show too is that like it&amp;#39;s like hey they totally had a part in in Laura Palmer&amp;#39;s murder and it&amp;#39;s like no they&amp;#39;re just [ __ ] [ __ ] right like they&amp;#39;re just they&amp;#39;re just like cheating on their on their spouses which is bad but like not at all related to the murder of this chick so people hide secrets in Twin Peaks that aren&amp;#39;t related to the main murder it makes everybody sus because everybody&amp;#39;s up to lying and up up to you know um being unfaithful you know so it makes everybody nonm morally principled people to some extent some more than others obviously so it puts everybody into a suspicion right but I think that&amp;#39;s kind of like what Diane&amp;#39;s role is is kind of like the hey she&amp;#39;s you know helping or she&amp;#39;s not helping but she&amp;#39;s taking part in infidelity so she&amp;#39;s bad but I think we&amp;#39;re going to find out that she doesn&amp;#39;t necessarily have anything to do with it because that&amp;#39;s kind of like where it comes from in terms of inspiration I would hate for it to be Thomas CU like Thomas is like doing his best that would really really suck if it was him um George is a harder one to pin down because like he is to our knowledge he&amp;#39;s he&amp;#39;s been in the town his whole life and been share of his whole life but um it seems like he&amp;#39;s devoted to this so it would be like a really big plot twist if he was like actually helping in these murders but like I don&amp;#39;t know here&amp;#39;s here&amp;#39;s here&amp;#39;s where it would actually make sense for him also hi Grace it&amp;#39;s good to see you bud do you enjoy the uh the DLC for separate way for that&amp;#39;s all you were playing yeah so this is where this would possibly make sense if George was The Insider is because in a in a way Anna was like flying in the face of like um what would be considered like an oldfashioned town right because you know York said that earlier not in reference to that but he was like there&amp;#39;s no more good oldfashioned towns anymore when he was going through on his thanks and find out that she was actually up to some you know not so great stuff and um obviously if you&amp;#39;re a very very traditional like you know Backwoods everything&amp;#39;s traditional sort of thing you would see somebody like Anna who&amp;#39;s doing all those things as like some sort of like corruption right like some sort of like you know like a weed that needs to be plucked which you know kind of goes with the whole sapling thing then tree thing that they&amp;#39;re kind of going for thematically so it&amp;#39;s like it isn&amp;#39;t impossible that it&amp;#39;s George but it&amp;#39;s very unlikely but I can see that rationale of like you know well they&amp;#39;re corrupting My Town they&amp;#39;re corrupting my good backwards town so like [ __ ] them right so that&amp;#39;s how that would actually like figure out like how that would like the thought process would go that way Thomas we don&amp;#39;t know a whole lot about Thomas like we just don&amp;#39;t know know too much about him besides the fact that he&amp;#39;s just very emotionally emotional and very like like a scary cat could be Olivia why would Olivia kill Anna they were co-workers but like we actually don&amp;#39;t know too much about their relationship he speaks positively about her but I don&amp;#39;t really have seem to have one jealousy Olivia&amp;#39;s not Anna isn&amp;#39;t cheating Anna didn&amp;#39;t cheat with Nick D is this seems cool it is we&amp;#39;re trying to deduce before we find out in game who the murderer is having a blaster is trying to finish hardcore hardcore good luck good luck I love watching people do challenge runs do never do them [Music] myself she&amp;#39;s very sus you guys are sus of Olivia that&amp;#39;s interesting [Music] interesting I didn&amp;#39;t even I honestly had I hav even factored her in I don&amp;#39;t think we know enough about Olivia yet besides the fact that she is the victim quote unquote of infidelity right with Nick being unfaithful I don&amp;#39;t think that would push her to kill Anna though was Anna have to do with that she likes trees but we found out she was lying about that we found out she was lying about that that was just her [ __ ] excuse for confronting Diane for you know cheating with her [Music] husband we found out that was just a shitty lie that she came up with on the spot could be killing beautiful women cuz she&amp;#39;s a delicate frame of mind I don&amp;#39;t think I&amp;#39;ve seen anything from her that would in like imply to me that any sort of like violent tendency I I suppose that is a that is like not a bad idea it&amp;#39;s a little on the nose though you know I think this is throwing us off the trail the um I think that&amp;#39;s what it and if I hadn&amp;#39;t seen Twin Peaks I probably would have come to this conclusion um cuz I think this whole like Diane Nick Olivia love triangle is just like a side bad thing that&amp;#39;s happening in the town that sucks but I don&amp;#39;t think necessarily Cycles back to the murder or this one or not with uh Anna or Becky pouring yourself a lot on people yeah but that could be that could be a reasonable feeling to have knowing that your husband is openly cheating on you and there&amp;#39;s nothing you can do about it right I mean you heard Dian she&amp;#39;s like hey I [ __ ] who I want you know like she&amp;#39;s very like I don&amp;#39;t give a [ __ ] right um and I think it gets more complicated cuz who is Olivia accomplished with right I guess we we&amp;#39;re getting more stuff revealed like you know Francis was there the day of the murderer playing with the kids with the with the dog that&amp;#39;s interesting we get obviously we&amp;#39;re going have to play more of the game but like we I&amp;#39;d have to see more out of Olivia to for me to start being suspect of Olivia yeah [Music] yeah that&amp;#39;s my current theory is that yeah there&amp;#39;s bad things happening in this town but not all of it is necessarily relate to the murder and I think the love triangle between the three of them probably is just a side thing that&amp;#39;s happening concurrently and not necessarily tied to the murder um yeah I&amp;#39;m sorry D me in the mic I&amp;#39;m surprised it didn&amp;#39;t mute itself because usually when I bump the mic it does that so I going to think I was talking about the brand too I thought for a second that like you know we found out that that Thomas does have a tattoo on his back but it&amp;#39;s not big enough the in in in we don&amp;#39;t see it but I my first thought was like oh well Thomas actually does have a back tattoo so you got to cover up but like I York would probably point that out as what bran said so yeah I don&amp;#39;t know that is true it could be I&amp;#39;m thinking the reverse right like maybe maybe Francis is the accomplice and somebody is the main murderer but like the whole thing that I was thinking with like the accomplice thing was like somebody&amp;#39;s a mole inside law enforcement that knows how to get rid of evidence and that&amp;#39;s why they haven&amp;#39;t been caught yet I don&amp;#39;t know they would do on some thoughts with that I&amp;#39;m not ending or anything it seem like that&amp;#39;s what I was getting towards I just wanted to stop and think about like what we know so far because I&amp;#39;ve been Theory crafting in my head I don&amp;#39;t know I think it&amp;#39;s really weird Forest okay sorry I think it&amp;#39;s really weird that like I&amp;#39;m probably overthinking this but just like the placement of of of of of Thomas and George here I don&amp;#39;t like how George called it in and it was the last one there and I don&amp;#39;t like how Thomas was the first one there when he when you know we would have been called first I don&amp;#39;t like that I think that lends a little bit of credence to like my working theory about that because there&amp;#39;s basically no reason that Thomas should have been there first and there&amp;#39;s basically no reason that George should have been there last if he was the one that called it in when Emily was with me so we know Emily didn&amp;#39;t kill Becky at the very least yeah that might actually clear Emily in my head cuz like she was with me so she couldn&amp;#39;t have killed Becky like she couldn&amp;#39;t have been a part of that at all I didn&amp;#39;t think about that yeah she was with me the whole time she has an alibi how did George know about Becky his son was there you talking about quiton that was sitting outside the front I&amp;#39;m assuming they called it in like they called the police station George is the first one who heard it or is the one that picked up the phone maybe and then pulled everybody immediately but that&amp;#39;s what I&amp;#39;m saying is like when if George supposed to have been there first then when he would like hoop in his car and went straight there like why was he the last one out of all of us there and how was Thomas there first like is he a psychic like [Music] H I don&amp;#39;t know what I am going to do though um real quick is that um I&amp;#39;m feeling a little like not to not in any way that&amp;#39;s alarming I&amp;#39;m feeling kind of like Oozy a little bit uh I I I only snack today I didn&amp;#39;t eat that&amp;#39;s probably is doing that so I&amp;#39;m going to like grab something real quick now try to kind of like Munch while we play I&amp;#39;m probably going to play for like another like two 3ish hours I imagine kind of what I&amp;#39;m feeling but I do need more fuel if I&amp;#39;m going to do that because I am a little out of it I&amp;#39;m aware of it so I&amp;#39;m going to go uh make something to to put in put in my tummy so I can feel a little bit more constent yeah fuel up yeah and I will be right back so enjoy the very very cozy piano and I&amp;#39;ll be back as soon as possible [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] what&amp;#39;s cool what&amp;#39;s cool chat pass my brother in the hallway pass my brother in the hallway he had a very very good observation and he hasn&amp;#39;t seen the game um so he&amp;#39;s not like leading me or anything there was that situation with that little like saw trap thing was very very sus I didn&amp;#39;t even think about that I wasn&amp;#39;t even thinking about that but apparently that&amp;#39;s my brother&amp;#39;s brain went he was talking about how like everybody was telling him please stop do not cut this do not cut this and he cuts it and then the chick dies right like Becky dies how he know how to execute the Trap correctly a&amp;#39;t that interesting I just kind of looked at him and I was like H I didn&amp;#39;t even think about that like if he had like cut it somewhere else would she have been fine or was that like this trap seem pretty complicated how did he know how to trigger it correctly like that was pretty smart oh me noticing things I was even [Music] noticing you just say it&amp;#39;s pretty good I think we&amp;#39;re getting pretty close talk about saw no there was somebody just had a saw like death in this game that we were trying to call attention to but he knew exactly how to trigger the Trap [Music] I&amp;#39;m having a chicken salad sandwich [Music] really previously during the investigation right how&amp;#39;s it going Thomas did you see Nick here no when I got here he was already like this what are you doing get out of the way I&amp;#39;ll do it George stay back she&amp;#39;s trying to speak no it couldn&amp;#39;t be please no got us good this time Zach why are we here oh I can&amp;#39;t believe it man now that&amp;#39;s Becky work at the mil me neither forget that when did Becky stop coming to work oh okay I think it was like from the day Anna was killed man yeah yeah yeah that&amp;#39;s right she was she was totally depressed about something Quint called for her to let us know she wasn&amp;#39;t coming in for work she must have been totally in shock the poor thing so you took the twins along to cheer her up that&amp;#39;s right hun if only I knew it would be like this I&amp;#39;d have spent more time talking to her you told me about a special secret between your children and Becky yes of course what about it it seems Becky handed them an item before she was killed any idea what that might be now that you mention it they had a box about this size which they said was very important that&amp;#39;s it I&amp;#39;d like to talk to them about this in person where are the boys now they went out actually with Mr KAS they mentioned going to the community center today h there is plenty of space to run around over there with Mr Cas do you know him well oh yeah he&amp;#39;s a good guy he always brings us gifts from his road trips the kids love him so we let him take them out every once in a while okay I&amp;#39;m going to tell you something for a little quality time let me talk do you come here okay I understand just as much with sitation calls for Ur not even true I&amp;#39;ll go and look for them a lot with like like crime stories and stuff like that sure of course I&amp;#39;ll contact the department there&amp;#39;s a red herring but there&amp;#39;s also usually like I don&amp;#39;t know what the opposite would be like a a good Herring I don&amp;#39;t know what you would call it but somebody who&amp;#39;s just too clean like so squeaky clean that it it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s like it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s invertedly suspicious cuz like okay he&amp;#39;s got the dog all the kids [ __ ] like him he gives everybody free gifts he&amp;#39;s just such a good guy where to start looking literally told me where they went no problem if I if if I was if I was um York I&amp;#39;d be asking to see that guy&amp;#39;s back immediately immediately immediately dude um there is a food thing at the police station we&amp;#39;re going to do that and today we&amp;#39;re stuck here having to search for lost children they&amp;#39;re not lost we&amp;#39;re the ones who are lost and so we are Emily I&amp;#39;m not Zach we may as well have fun if we&amp;#39;re getting lost you sure know how to take your time in a time like this well we have a food thing we got to go to we&amp;#39;re on the wrong side of town for that if it is the police station again yeah I&amp;#39;m starting to get kind of an internal map of the place there&amp;#39;s still a lot of like like of the back RS I don&amp;#39;t see I can&amp;#39;t believe two people have been murdered in our town and now two young children are at the center of all I just can&amp;#39;t come to grips with it yet crime will happen wherever there are people and that&amp;#39;s why we have our jobs might be easier for you because you don&amp;#39;t live here true these were people that I knew that were killed and the murderer might be someone who lives here in this town it&amp;#39;s really depressing I know but someone has to bring this murder to Justice you&amp;#39;re right I know but New York sometimes I just think I&amp;#39;m not really cut out to be a cop not true you have the potential to be a superb law enforcer oh you can be emotional at times but you also possess what&amp;#39;s most important I do what do you mean that&amp;#39;s sweet a sense of justice justice I must admit I&amp;#39;m surprised to hear such a how should I say this such an obvious answer I thought you&amp;#39;d say something else obvious or not I joined thebi in order to do what&amp;#39;s right and that&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s important I understand but still you seem I&amp;#39;m sorry I I need some time to think whatever do you want to think about interesting Justice I want to think about Justice Zach she&amp;#39;s quite the philosopher isn&amp;#39;t she then again death makes everyone a philosopher I like their little back and forth I think it&amp;#39;s very interesting and it&amp;#39;s always fun to listen to them talk to each other she&amp;#39;s going to yell at me for getting out be like okay whatever you suck for wanting to dilly dally and then I&amp;#39;m going to be meet her inside so yeah is there something you want to check out well but Detective thanks Raptor I appreciate that I can see you won&amp;#39;t be rushed I&amp;#39;m going to go ahead I have more theories and I have more evidence for my theories that would be F Le what I&amp;#39;ve played so far then I&amp;#39;ll head over to the place that Lily mentioned don&amp;#39;t take too long before you catch up okay she was nice about it this time he wasn&amp;#39;t like you&amp;#39;re the worst person in the planet and I hate you because you&amp;#39;re taking long is what they always react like that they&amp;#39;re were yeah it seems like they&amp;#39;re getting along more that they talk and it&amp;#39;s kind of nice to see wait Thomas is in here like usual where is Thomas then a at details interesting oh it&amp;#39;s just from here yeah usually he&amp;#39;s in here I couldn&amp;#39;t get through this door for a [Music] second yeah where&amp;#39;s the boy things that make you think can I swap here suit is ugly this suit is disgusting but I&amp;#39;m going to wear it cuz I bought it I&amp;#39;m getting my money&amp;#39;s worth where&amp;#39;s our homie Thomas we clean what you mean I&amp;#39;m going to show up your wedding wearing this okay we&amp;#39;ll see how you feel then I&amp;#39;m sure you won&amp;#39;t agree oh here it is door you dressed me check the weather we get pre money for doing that somebody pay me $32 to something my day like [Music] that you know this doesn&amp;#39;t taste good today that&amp;#39;s not true guys Thomas made us find lunch as always we should at least try to enjoy it you&amp;#39;re right we we shouldn&amp;#39;t be moping around even more so in times like these I agree with Agent Morgan being so stressed out about our progress will only lead to mistakes we should enjoy lunch that&amp;#39;s the very least we should do as they say the uh early bird catches the worm Sheriff George you probably mean laugh and grow fact why you just put him under [ __ ] George is like you&amp;#39;re next yes well okay since we&amp;#39;re all smiling again let&amp;#39;s get back to work did you hear that did you catch what I caught somebody fumbled the mic at the end of that like recording of that of that little bit I heard like Mike Folly that&amp;#39;s something I&amp;#39;m very familiar with as a content creator so they just left that in or they just didn&amp;#39;t realize it was there huh that&amp;#39;s funny a little bit of a a mistake an editing mistake wa I think I&amp;#39;m well fed D I think I&amp;#39;m not like I&amp;#39;m already feeling a lot better now that I have like sandwich and some chippies in me thank you for being patient with that that was ugly yeah usually I eat before stream but I just didn&amp;#39;t feel like it today I was feeling really out of it then I started feeling even more out of it cuz I had eaten and I&amp;#39;m like oops okay that does damage to my car hitting that traffic cone what was that traffic cone made out of Whoa We popped a wheelie so this case turned into a Multiple homicide what kind of motives turn a criminal into a serial killer is it hedonistic ritualistic copycat crime sex related cannibalistic cannibalism Bureau statistics these interesting ideas don&amp;#39;t always really explain the real motive they&amp;#39;re just words phrases that the media uses to scare citizens the spotlight falls on a mere 1% of all cases only the weird you understand all this right Zach no matter how bizarre crime may appear to be at the root there is all wait Emily where are you going hey come back most people simp gra she&amp;#39;s this way pleasure but that kind of Common Sense never applies to our investigations maybe we&amp;#39;re lucky or unlucky depending on how you look at it we end up nope Z we&amp;#39;re here let&amp;#39;s continue our chat later agent York I found Isaac and Isaiah they&amp;#39;re over there let&amp;#39;s go hello again Isaac and Isaiah I hear you&amp;#39;re teaching Willie to do tricks what&amp;#39;s your secret it&amp;#39;s easy really simple if he does it right we give him a treat a cookie if he does it right I see very clever so tell me you to could you perhaps tell me your other secret with Becky no we can&amp;#39;t it won&amp;#39;t be a secret if we tell um I&amp;#39;m not telling we promised Becky no that&amp;#39;s a problem because I also made a promise to Becky promise to catch the bad man word but I can&amp;#39;t keep my promise if I don&amp;#39;t know what the secret is do you see they thinking hard about this she told us to give Diane a box it wasn&amp;#39;t that heavy we took it to the art gallery and gave it to Diane is that all Becky gave you um just when we were leaving to take the box to Diane Becky called us back she handed us something it was small and round she told us to keep it safe safe in our pocket and give it to Diane and then you met Carol on your way yep I took the round thing out of my pocket and we looked at it and then she talked to us we told her that we were on an errand for Becky she said she&amp;#39;d do it for us but we told her no because Becky asked us not her we promised Becky to do it ourselves so Becky did entrust the locket to them and now Carol has it right K huh you were in the room when Carol took the locket back from Diane I saw you with Diane in the art gallery that day well yeah I I I I was there in the room but but I was only chatting with Diane oh then Carol burst in all Angry looking while Carol and Diane had their talk I I just sat there like a frog yeah so Carol took the locket from Diane but that has nothing to do with me right you so defensive H yes I believe so but from this instant you are now a key witness in this case I&amp;#39;m afraid you can&amp;#39;t leave town until you hear from me good what can you do that that this is all starting to sound a little like aliceon Wonderland which makes you Humpty Dumpty huh Isaac and Isaiah thank you I think I&amp;#39;ll be able to keep my promise with Becky thanks to you too how is Becky is she getting better she&amp;#39;ll come and help out at our store again won&amp;#39;t she she&amp;#39;ll come and play with us again won&amp;#39;t she boys about Becky that&amp;#39;s right um Becky is almost totally better now but I don&amp;#39;t think she&amp;#39;ll be able to come and see you I was told by Becky to keep this a secret but she&amp;#39;s actually a goddess of the forest just like Anna I think she&amp;#39;s going to be in the forest with Anna for a while cool we&amp;#39;ll keep this a secret then too wow that&amp;#39;s why Anna and Becky are such good friends okay okay Willie you&amp;#39;re happy too aren&amp;#39;t you Zach I hope Emily doesn&amp;#39;t end up as a forest goddess too okay then Zach let&amp;#39;s go over what we found out recently about the case first first Diane the owner of the artart gallery she was out drinking with Nick Cormac in a bar on the night Anna died Nick confirmed this and so she has an alibi but then we have what Nick&amp;#39;s wife Olivia told us according to Olivia Nick and Diane not only went to the bar but also went somewhere else that night do you remember where that was Zach oh [ __ ] I don&amp;#39;t remember I didn&amp;#39;t know I was being asked a question that&amp;#39;s right okay the art gallery before entering the gallery Diane looked back towards Olivia almost as though she saw Olivia in the dark Nick&amp;#39;s Behavior has also become more suspicious by the day if Olivia is correct then he is heavily involved in this case but we have no inclusive evidence of that at the moment the only thing we can say for sure is that Nick&amp;#39;s wearabouts are unknown at the time of Becky&amp;#39;s murder has no alibi for the crime that fact alone means nothing so who was it that called Thomas to report trouble at Becky&amp;#39;s Place that&amp;#39;s what we were talking about who called it in was it Quinn that&amp;#39;s right yeah it was Quint Becky&amp;#39;s boyfriend he went to her house and saw the tragedy now about Becky&amp;#39;s murder I the B still mortified killer struck again while we were on the case we found her bitten off tongue a massive amount of red seeds that poured out in the blood an inverted peace symbol like the one seen at the of murder from the similarities one can deduce that Anna&amp;#39;s killer killed Becky we also found one other important piece of evidence in Becky&amp;#39;s room can you remember what that was Zack what oh wait that&amp;#39;s not right Zack that&amp;#39;s okay so we found the broken stille heel but we also found in the notebook we found them both there that&amp;#39;s kind of a trick question that&amp;#39;s right we found a Sketchbook in Becky&amp;#39;s room she had apparently WR a letter to her sister Diane it revealed that Becky took a locket from Anna&amp;#39;s body at the crime scene she also admitted to borrowing a pair of Diane&amp;#39;s stiletto heels shoes so miss stiletto heels was Becky there was something else at the end of the letter it said that she handed the locket and stiletto heel shoes to someone do you remember who Zach that&amp;#39;s right Zach and from what Isaac and Isaiah told us Carol offered to take the items to Diane but the twins refused they gave them to Diane themselves as they had promised for some reason Carol wanted the lock it she ended up storming into the gallery to take it from Diane and when Carol took the locket from Diane Cas just happened to be there is Cas involved in this or was he just there by coincidence no I wonder what&amp;#39;s so special about the locket too why did Carol want it so badly the questions are mounting come to think of it Quint the first witness has no Al for Becky&amp;#39;s death we checked the phone records and his call definitely came from her house is it possible he attacked Becky and then called us from the scene Wonder but everyone is suspicious one way or another I don&amp;#39;t think so what should we do next Z okay who&amp;#39;s the most suspicious I don&amp;#39;t even have have an option here interesting yeah the people I&amp;#39;m thinking of that&amp;#39;s right Becky&amp;#39;s sister and Carol&amp;#39;s enemy linked to both Nick and Cas the elegant owner of the art gallery Zack that&amp;#39;s our next move we&amp;#39;ll start with Diane so you want to find out everything there is to know about Diane that&amp;#39;s right there&amp;#39;s just too many things that we don&amp;#39;t know first we need more Intel about the relationship between Nick and Diane how Nick and Diane meet every night at the bar let&amp;#39;s use that George we&amp;#39;ll need you to stake out the gallery what do you mean wait in the parking lot of the art gallery and tail Diane when she leaves if she goes anywhere other than the bar you let me know Emily you take the diner wait for Nick and tail him to the bar too as with George if he goes anywhere else then you let me know okay Thomas you keep a watch on them inside the bar yes yes I will I&amp;#39;ll be waiting in the parking lot of the bar once Nick and Diane are together I will follow them wherever they go what time do they usually show up Thomas around the same time ter terrible [ __ ] suit dude it&amp;#39;s so bad that time we do it boys and girls all this has only happened in a week that&amp;#39;s crazy I think our characters only slept like once or twice in that whole time huh interesting Zach we need to be at Carol&amp;#39;s bar at 2200 looks like we have some time to kill we can go to the diner and see how Nick and Olivia are doing 8 hours total play time it&amp;#39;s probably my play time if it&amp;#39;s 8 hours Jason&amp;#39;s here again why is he always everywhere why are you always about Zach is there something here that you want to check out we need to be at Carol&amp;#39;s bar at 2200 we&amp;#39;re free until then what you doing he&amp;#39;s just ignoring me the way you just got in this car like he hey intriguing yeah where he just got in this car he like [ __ ] you I&amp;#39;m not talking to you I want to Shar that he was killed right and it came home as though nothing had happened just like normal that&amp;#39;s what makes me even more scared I feel like on the ver whenever is breaking [Music] down you can&amp;#39;t come back there at all I should probably take this time where I probably take some time while we&amp;#39;re um have some time in between the case to to uh drive over and refill on our um mob supplies like coffee access thing I&amp;#39;m going to go down to the uh the mil Barn store down here well I don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;ll be open yeah I actually don&amp;#39;t think that&amp;#39;ll be open I think about it because it is the middle of the night prob have to wait to do that another time actually glad I thought about that before I weren&amp;#39;t driving all the way over there Zack picking up from where we left off so Zack this case turned into a Multiple homicide okay what kind of motives turn a criminal into a serial killer is it hedonistic ritualistic okay so you starting the dialogue all over again sex related cannibalistic bureau&amp;#39;s statistics these interesting ideas don&amp;#39;t always really explain the real motive they&amp;#39;re just words phrases that the media uses to scare citizens the spotlight falls on a mere 1% of all cases only the weird ones you understand all this right Zach no matter how bizarre a crime may appear to be at the root there is always Ag and personal interest right Zach most people simply don&amp;#39;t kill for pleasure but that kind of Common Sense never applies to our investigations maybe we&amp;#39;re lucky or unlucky depending on how you look at it we end up working on those cases in that 1% do you remember Zach the first case we handled just after becoming a special agent now let&amp;#39;s talk about this another time interesting I don&amp;#39;t feel like it right now hey got some back story going with the homie here Zach looks like we still have some time to I wish it would even let I wish it would even let you like go in I go the green circle until it was time it was like to essentially keep you out until there was like uh right time wait why am I over here wait why did my character smoking yeat me to the other side of the street what the heck is that [Music] about Zach looks like we wait did I stop early I did stop early a [ __ ] I wasn&amp;#39;t looking that&amp;#39;s my bad was not looking up at the clock up at the top which is probably the most important part of doing this so yeah is my [Music] bad yo Dev thanks so much for the follow very much appreciate that bud hope you&amp;#39;re doing well [Music] tonight Nick&amp;#39;s still in the bar just as we planned then I wonder what happens next agent York you&amp;#39;re really enjoying this aren&amp;#39;t you I have to admit I envy that agent is leaving the bar what about Diane she isn&amp;#39;t here tonight Emily check that with George George can you hear me Nick&amp;#39;s leaving the bar what&amp;#39;s happening with Diane no movement tell me what to do here stay Qui George I&amp;#39;m thinking Nick will head to the gallery let&amp;#39;s meet up there he watching month popped by Al I appreciate that D I work really hard on that stuff so it always means a lot when you guys come over and say hi I very very much appreciate it oh why is he bar in the car to keep you waiting let&amp;#39;s go okay time to play with the big boys Nick him I think he noticed us how can you stay calm at a time like this we just failed no need to worry Nick will do this all again tomorrow night how can you be so short what just cuz I drove slightly too close for half a second what the [ __ ] what the [ __ ] are you kidding me that is like the harshest fail State I&amp;#39;ve seen for this game in a hot minute whoa that&amp;#39;s [ __ ] up that is [ __ ] up previously during the investig that&amp;#39;s crazy crazy you drove slightly too close to him for like half a second game like yeah [ __ ] restart idiot that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s crazy that&amp;#39;s [ __ ] nutty okay oh we&amp;#39;ll go back try to stay farther away next time experience yeah there&amp;#39;s a lot of that in this game heard that oh you just press start to skip all that I was just attempting yeah I was just attempting to see if I can skip through it you can you just start all that Zach is there something here that you want to check out we need to be at Carol&amp;#39;s bar at 2200 right first time [Music] this game that&amp;#39;s exactly what it is Dev it&amp;#39;s a uh it&amp;#39;s kind of like a twin page it&amp;#39;s exactly what it is so that&amp;#39;s a good catch on your part so it starts getting yellow that&amp;#39;s what we really got to like chill orangy color we drive so slow though what am I supposed to do drive faster brother he&amp;#39;s literally going like 25 miles an hour about to tail get him while he&amp;#39;s driving like a grandma from 15 to 35 literally okay now we&amp;#39;re over 30 but now we&amp;#39;re gaining on them because we&amp;#39;re going over 30 riveting gameplay absolutely R good game play I&amp;#39;m really having to ride my brakes to follow him from afar this is so sad this is pain like an escort Mission but better hey at least I don&amp;#39;t to defend anybody defend the speed limit well we know one thing about Nick he doesn&amp;#39;t break traffic laws he&amp;#39;s a very good driver who&amp;#39;s got that from at least suspicious hey I don&amp;#39;t break traffic CL my S this putting me to sleep I can take a nap for this why does this last so long could he have not have driven faster to his [ __ ] destination can&amp;#39;t speed there&amp;#39;s a Sheriff at him true guess I am I&amp;#39;m defeating the purpose here I&amp;#39;m working against myself I know what&amp;#39;s coming to him I mean he&amp;#39;s wearing down my patience as we speak wearing down my patience so he&amp;#39;s going to get it what is this car what is this car doing doing a illegal U-turn hold on hold on Nick got an illegal U-turn coming around got to punish the boy put on your lights I think he notic it was for a joke Cal at a time like this we have to do that all over again cuz I was trying to make a joke I was trying to make a funny previously I was trying to make a funny and the game&amp;#39;s like hey hey it was for half a second too like the moment I flicked it it was like hey [ __ ] on section last too [ __ ] long the answer too [ __ ] long I&amp;#39;m got to do it all the [ __ ] over again not a happy CER going to fall asleep what&amp;#39;s the hum of the engine and the [Music] rain that it was cozy but you can&amp;#39;t just like autopilot it because if he gets too far away you lose and if he gets too close you lose if you throw on your lights you lose you lose no matter what Z is [Music] okay third times the charm boys third times&amp;#39;s the [ __ ] charm yeah that PA menu is very weird it&amp;#39;s a brand new never surfing Chase content it&amp;#39;s so sad dude no they thought it they they like wanting this section to happen like story-wise so to speak you know of like hey you tail this guy cuz it&amp;#39;s cool that&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s going to happen in the story the actual gameplay of it it&amp;#39;s just at least have like Thomas and Emily talk to me while we&amp;#39;re doing this you know I&amp;#39;m chitchat with me dead silence following this guy is redonkulous it seems relatively fine the problem is like when like a car is in front of the person we&amp;#39;re tailing they just start going really slow and then they keep having to like stop to respect what the other car&amp;#39;s AI is doing you know that&amp;#39;s when it gets really bad like when he&amp;#39;s out in the open like this where there&amp;#39;s like nobody ahead of him it seems like it&amp;#39;s fine but there&amp;#39;s a car in front of him it&amp;#39;s really like right now like why did he almost come to a complete stop why that was even like a car in front of him that was a car driving by him on the opposite side of the W line why do he nearly stop stop I&amp;#39;m so [ __ ] confused why are why are you doing this why do you nearly almost stop when a car drives by you on the opposite side of the road that&amp;#39;s where they&amp;#39;re supposed to be I don&amp;#39;t understand yeah we tried throwing our lights on it failed the whole mission oh bu it&amp;#39;s a circle yeah like even if a car&amp;#39;s on the other side of the street it starts flowing down for this is riving gaml much soda that&amp;#39;s funny ever since I&amp;#39;ve been U partnered by Rog I haven&amp;#39;t been drinking that much soda is probably better for me oop sorry I was trying to I almost dozed off and started actually playing the video game normally forgot we&amp;#39;re in this really slow mode did they play test the section why is that should always do that U-turn there he did that last time and he honks at me while he&amp;#39;s doing an illegal U-turn like huh not too bright to honk get a sheriff while you&amp;#39;re doing illegal U-turn that was kid anything back true true I tried and I got in trouble I&amp;#39;m in pain right now and then if I [ __ ] up at all it makes me do it all over again so you can&amp;#39;t even like it&amp;#39;s not like it drops you back at a checkpoint or something get too close start it over again this is main story too this isn&amp;#39;t like side content this is the main [ __ ] plot so this is unavoidable I can&amp;#39;t like Take My Eyes of what&amp;#39;s Happening I got to focus on that number so I don&amp;#39;t get in trouble I&amp;#39;m trying to get between 50 and 40 it&amp;#39;s not like I can like me that 2hour refund policy somehow there would even that would even a thing back in the day this game&amp;#39;s 13 years old although I know there&amp;#39;s a lot of people that listen to my stream to like chill and fall asleep sometimes so I bet this is the best section in the world for them bro for the Seer Saturn never cuz that game&amp;#39;s [ __ ] dog that game is even based off of the the good movie it&amp;#39;s based off of the shitty sequel back what I missed the most arduous [ __ ] tailing mission in video game history I like this game so much but like this is the most agonizing boring thing I&amp;#39;ve ever done in a video game I just want it to stop we&amp;#39;re going across the entire [ __ ] town where is he possibly going thank gosh holy [ __ ] [Applause] we&amp;#39;d all have halos by now if I was driving I think someone&amp;#39;s putting a curse on all the cars I drive recently aent York Nick&amp;#39;s getting away don&amp;#39;t time to get serious hold on get but wait wait I thought we weren&amp;#39;t supposed to alert him what do you mean it&amp;#39;s going to get bumpy W that alert him am I missing something not that noise is Nick here George no he hasn&amp;#39;t showed up here what about Diane any movement no action here at all did something happen yes a little but George something&amp;#39;s different about you are you okay actually I had a little drink while I was waiting this is my first first murder case after all I&amp;#39;m on Ed the first one ever it was only a little though I&amp;#39;m still in control back Nick and Diane were probably both inside George you&amp;#39;re sure you didn&amp;#39;t see Nick positive I haven&amp;#39;t taken my eyes from the entrance all night not that I don&amp;#39;t trust you George but I&amp;#39;m positive Nick is here is there another entrance not that I know of qualifying statement I&amp;#39;ll look subject is being defensive help me out if you can would you deceptive sorry wrong [Music] word what the [ __ ] what the [ __ ] um guys&amp;#39;s not looking too hard right now oh that&amp;#39;s why Emily didn&amp;#39;t let us go back here earlier because this is a plot relevant area they right the [ __ ] now yeah after all that I might actually fall asleep if I have to do that again on ironically holy [ __ ] holy [ __ ] [ __ ] I I would have dead ass probably passed out like started sleeping in the middle of the stream if I had to do that again never ever again honk Sho honk shoe this is how we clear Rubble the FBI oh huh oh hi wait George and Emily are here George Emily and Thomas are here can they see this or is this still just only me that can see this that guy is just [ __ ] Invincible to bullets until he&amp;#39;s like really close to me and I don&amp;#39;t know why you saying this [ __ ] yeah they&amp;#39;re not even commenting still I guess not oh hey I was going to grab those what the the [ __ ] was that okay listen can you stop whatever you&amp;#39;re doing you let know about this that is true oh well there&amp;#39;s people behind you yor I would be a little more careful right oh you are using your shotgun you proud of you do I have to just like kill these guys over and over until the doors open cuz sometimes they&amp;#39;re invinc like it&amp;#39;s just infinite and sometimes not ridiculous it is in h how&amp;#39;s it going homie might be infinite so what do I need to do to get in there than after having a good day people tell me that about D a lot too I&amp;#39;m sure that shocks absolutely nobody zombie ghost yeah there&amp;#39;s like weird Silent Hill world that like hasn&amp;#39;t really been explaining the plot yet it appears that only only uh this front lock yes it appears only uh York can see it we hasn&amp;#39;t been explained to us yet what the deal with that is I&amp;#39;m just going to leave there&amp;#39;s like another something or another to do onion wow a raw onion out in the middle of nowhere cool I do have to go into this little shed here we just sleep in the middle of this I don&amp;#39;t think so dab what he say like I&amp;#39;m I&amp;#39;m going to go Eep guys hold on what the [ __ ] what the [ __ ] what the [ __ ] is happening these guys are infinite you can&amp;#39;t go around that way um Can can this aim correctly um she was invincible besides her head that was intriguing really had to headshot her maybe they&amp;#39;re not infinite cuz that other one stopped showing up maybe it&amp;#39;s just a lot yeah cuz the other one stop spawning I just don&amp;#39;t know what else I would be doing starting to think maybe that&amp;#39;s not it I don&amp;#39;t know I don&amp;#39;t know can&amp;#39;t shoot it can you yeah back here all that&amp;#39;s [ __ ] yeah all of that oh good thing I saved my game just froze good thing I just saved uh what the what the [ __ ] do I get in there yeah it&amp;#39;s not responding yeah it&amp;#39;s not responding it&amp;#39;s crashing yep there you go what how do I get in there I do not know how I get in there that is weird because it seemed like that one spawn point did get run out did eventually run dry so it stopped responding people but like um shooting the white door is a locking shop usually when there&amp;#39;s a lock there&amp;#39;s a a lock block you can shoot off it&amp;#39;s like very it&amp;#39;s not like you can see it it&amp;#39;s like a big old pad block It&amp;#39;s usually the case when the game makes me do that I didn&amp;#39;t see a padlock I can check again when we get back in here maybe and see if that&amp;#39;s the case yeah I can check for a padlock and see if I see one maybe it&amp;#39;s just around the front I don&amp;#39;t know I don&amp;#39;t know why it would put us in uh it would put us in uh silent hole mode if it didn&amp;#39;t have to do with like the enemies and stuff I do not know but we&amp;#39;ll take a closer look closer look when we get in there talk to everyone first yeah that is true I didn&amp;#39;t talk to anybody before I went in there just like I&amp;#39;m going to go Vibe so maybe I [ __ ] up by not speaking to everybody my leg is asleep I don&amp;#39;t like the way that feels a that is that uncomfortable feeling like that you some yeah swalled air can&amp;#39;t talk so some Rogue energy for my leg that&amp;#39;s so wild that like that&amp;#39;s so funny what uh what Cinema said earlier we never saw Twin Peaks yeah [ __ ] I did not like me for a b I&amp;#39;m sorry good to have you back friend Emily what&amp;#39;s happening Thomas what&amp;#39;s happening it&amp;#39;s also kind of sus that the first time we put George on something individually he&amp;#39;s like ah I got drunk for the first time ever uh-huh house is this this is the art gallery I don&amp;#39;t want to die oh I see there&amp;#39;s a thing over here red plot important things over here I need to refresh all my snacks and stuff oh oh hello everyone P yes got to get through guys please stop responding please stop responding give me f me coming through give me f me coming through we&amp;#39;re just going to ignore y&amp;#39;all cuz you guys are taking way too much time just wants to see what happens but my no death run my no death run I would ruin it oh I see this is uh we&amp;#39;re supposed to come around here first and then come out through there just like that res Evil 2 thing res Evil 2 maker like just run into the zombie see nothing bad&amp;#39;s going to happen how do they not see all the enemies Emily I want you guys to wait out here I know I&amp;#39;m not going to fight you about this anymore but promise me this if there&amp;#39;s trouble then you&amp;#39;ll call us in okay he cares I like their friendship it&amp;#39;s nice you might not think so but we&amp;#39;re a team a team that&amp;#39;s what I think at least and I&amp;#39;m interested in you and Zach I don&amp;#39;t want anything to happen to you before I hear more about you two oh you find this interesting there&amp;#39;s not the time to smoke friend got pressing matters to attend to Zach did you hear that she wants to know more about you isn&amp;#39;t that a nice surprise amazing I don&amp;#39;t want to die what what the [ __ ] do that mean oh cool did the director C made stuff easier would be the Locking on I can imagine like I don&amp;#39;t use lock on every single time I&amp;#39;m like going to fight but like there definitely times I feel like I would be very annoyed without it there is that like that noise yeah I don&amp;#39;t like that noise whatever that is I&amp;#39;m assuming he has something to do with those vents huh oh well she&amp;#39;s freaky I sawo uh I don&amp;#39;t like what you&amp;#39;re doing are you are you invincible oh she crawls a little bit and then she becomes oh I see wait what does that mean wait what do that mean oh that what the [ __ ] was that thing oh it&amp;#39;s trying to break your tape through why does it say attack there attacking does nothing [ __ ] that&amp;#39;s interesting probably just aade yeah I don&amp;#39;t know why it gives me the option to attack if it&amp;#39;s just the wrong idea yeah I&amp;#39;m just going to evade I&amp;#39;m just going to evade that&amp;#39;s that just didn&amp;#39;t hit me oh ow what the [ __ ] this is very weird can she stop doing the thing she&amp;#39;s doing oh yeah cuz I&amp;#39;m 80s oh I see yeah so I&amp;#39;m still getting the attack prompt for when I have my gun up even though I should be just evading that that&amp;#39;s funny yeah you a lot of [ __ ] Health you&amp;#39;re war that was homie is [ __ ] gaming yeah they were they were a little bit of a toughy should drink that root here to help my EPS we yeah that was something free money hope at some point we get an explanation on what that even means oh wait no we don&amp;#39;t need the EP anymore we got root beer we&amp;#39;re good donut now I got something for my hungies at least Silent Hill is uh very accommodating to my physical needs like actual Silent Hill which could not be more indifferent okay one way to go see like usually pad blocks look like this they got the big Iron thing on them game so [ __ ] strange not a bad way this is the entrance hall get into that until uh we have the evidence too much noise yeah I know I need more stuff to solve the case interesting goes here hey it&amp;#39;s the tree thing welcome back tree thing I missed you remembered you from the lumber Factory okay so we need to pick stuff up and put them on these pedestals interesting okay whatever you say hello again flesh tree and he&amp;#39;s just told rill about this for whatever reason the tree has the apples K it what what what what what what is the timer for oh I&amp;#39;m sorry wait what&amp;#39;s the timer for timer for what timer for what hello help me get the give me the apples give I don&amp;#39;t like how these are on a timer now yeah I don&amp;#39;t like how the timer is just there without explanation it&amp;#39;s just like okay [Music] what do you mean it&amp;#39;s red they click the wrong thing what do you mean it&amp;#39;s a red apple what do you mean by that what do you mean I&amp;#39;m so confused I&amp;#39;m going to die I&amp;#39;m going to die red apple does not go where the red apple is Red Apple is not Red Apple goes that goes to him oh gosh there&amp;#39;s a third Apple did I get the third Apple oh there is a third one ah [ __ ] ah [ __ ] oh [ __ ] oh [ __ ] it was in a different spot ah oh ripe apple and red apple oh you you think you&amp;#39;re funny game&amp;#39;s got jokes now uh red and rip Apple are actually different actually stop it no not actually no Nerge [ __ ] man you did that on purpose to make things stressful oh well it&amp;#39;s not a it&amp;#39;s not a good reward for all that so weird there are more [Music] question Shadow do you have that on a a copy paste somewhere like on a notepad or do you typ that out every time like with all of these I&amp;#39;m not going to listen to the whole profiling until all of them are finished so we have all three of the evidences so we can watch the whole thing this is interesting the gallery in the silent h world is uh more intimidating looking I was thinking that earlier like when we were walking through the gallery 2 it was kind of like windy and stuff I was like I wonder anything oh oh oh oh homie were just chilling in the doorway almost got you it was cleverly placed key to the special exhibition room okay great oh [ __ ] a very sneakily placed don&amp;#39;t want to die oh hey it&amp;#39;s that stiletto heal that Becky broke if we never ever get an explanation to what the S Hill world is about and all the enemies that are in I&amp;#39;m going to be extremely disappointed it seems really intriguing but so far the game has made zero explanation to explain it whatsoever not even hinted at what it could possibly be it&amp;#39;s just them just kind of like throwing something on there to be like hey now there&amp;#39;s gameplay in our video game look at that to [Music] be there you go BR you got your what you wanted there you go why are they just Invincible sometimes you come from his mother these guys are probably just infinitely spawning oh hi everyone give me inter up my apologies wait why is this red but I can&amp;#39;t interact with it do I have to lift that up somehow somewhere else this is red too what the [ __ ] is that [Music] thing what on Earth oh that&amp;#39;s ominous okay so now we can watch all this now that this is all here you what are you doing here so it was you much more Asing than I imagined impr what the that&amp;#39;s terrifying that shows him killing Diane but like Diane&amp;#39;s still here another one of these items that noise hurts my [Music] ears for well here you are again what the [ __ ] whoa whoa whoa you&amp;#39;re behaving differently I don&amp;#39;t like what you&amp;#39;re doing ear thing is getting right up in your face and then suddenly like doing something well that&amp;#39;s why you don&amp;#39;t just do what I just did cuz her her little scripted attack if she&amp;#39;s St in front of you it&amp;#39;s an auto hit this one we don&amp;#39;t actually want to run away from we wanted to get close we can hit yeah cuz that hits that&amp;#39;s an auto hit if you&amp;#39;re too close she not get cor there a you have so much health they very annoying a shotgun too I don&amp;#39;t have the shotgun I never ever got a shotgun I&amp;#39;ve had ammo for the shotgun forever and never had the shotgun thank goodness that was lasting forever that was incredibly tedious please get close to me one again cuz she does have the third one if that&amp;#39;s consistent we can just bur this a bit then get away when she goes for it yeah I was clearly still that but sure and then she goes for the yep all right so we don&amp;#39;t have to like run every time just the after the first two um okay okay game just shot straight through her body didn&amp;#39;t stop her and got grabbed cool she does a [ __ ] ton of damage this is okay all right come on over guess I&amp;#39;ll be using the lock on what she did after the first one that time what the [ __ ] she is so annoying man prob like difficult just irritating honest yeah I&amp;#39;m just going to use the lock on from now on cuz I don&amp;#39;t want to that situation again where I&amp;#39;m shooting through her body why did you just stop there what the [ __ ] was that why did you just chill there for a second what that all about like how the game is put two very long T sections long to tedious segments right next to each other the tailing car thing which is putting me to sleep and now the [ __ ] there&amp;#39;s a [ __ ] another one this is so boring okay oh this is so worry oh you&amp;#39;re the other one you&amp;#39;re the you&amp;#39;re the sneaky one they&amp;#39;re the one that crawls a little bit and then gets cor real I think you&amp;#39;re better than the other one that other one was [ __ ] annoying I avoided that without even doing the thing I just kind of running that&amp;#39;s whenever she falls to the ground that she&amp;#39;s doing that where she does the uh the smoke cloud attack both of them both kinds of this enemy yeah that&amp;#39;s just a response to H ground they were they invisible can you those they&amp;#39;re not not I&amp;#39;m not getting blood splits or anything yeah I can&amp;#39;t be right on top of her that&amp;#39;s the only exception can&amp;#39;t be on top of her when she does that what the [ __ ] was that how he put his weapon away work have some self perservation sweetie yeah I&amp;#39;m not getting blood Spurs until the corpro [Music] that&amp;#39;s how I feel after that [ __ ] fight oh oh [ __ ] he coffee black coffee from Silent Hill R certainly it feels better feels better tastes better whatever there&amp;#39;s a lot going on in here guys are annoying yeah they weren&amp;#39;t even like bad they were just frustrating they were just annoying where they I made oops I don&amp;#39;t have any food not have napped should not have napped in Silent Hill Z no no no and we&amp;#39;re just back without explanation Nick wait he&amp;#39;s out cold heard himg where are you come on open up so George didn&amp;#39;t hear or see any of this happen Dian George call with the body wait she&amp;#39;s still alive well we know what not to do right di George it&amp;#39;s no good it won&amp;#39;t no em stand back what are they trying to do wait what are they [Music] doing I don&amp;#39;t feel like this is the right course of action there&amp;#39;s not enough time catch us I don&amp;#39;t think this is going to end well [Music] uh these noises dude can of pickles Thomas call an ambulance what what an ambulance youer agent York George are you okay yes I&amp;#39;m okay I think I&amp;#39;m too old to be an acrobat though Diane looks okay too she should be able to tell us who did this to her God I hope so but you George quite a catch I&amp;#39;m impressed George what oh she just stood up Diana what the [ __ ] like I&amp;#39;m good what a beautiful the one who off the what the what now oh what is that dialogue you C out yeah they took they bite the tongues out of all their victims The Killers too oh she&amp;#39;s stop right there Nick you&amp;#39;re under arrest for the attempted murder of Diane as he&amp;#39;s not all there either back off don&amp;#39;t touch me like with I didn&amp;#39;t like you within one but I like with too oh that&amp;#39;s not good nove what the [ __ ] is happening em H oh but homie [ __ ] died that&amp;#39;s unfortunate I don&amp;#39;t know why she got she got up and started acting weird yeah that should be fine no there&amp;#39;s nothing that indicate that she would do that go I requested Thomas will need a body bag too oh Nick hasn&amp;#39;t resisted arrest they would have been fine Nick quiet quiet Nick shut the [ __ ] up can you hear that which got murdered why is this music playing I think he wants us to follow him shall we follow Zach yeah tell me boy what&amp;#39;s up why is this jawy music playing right after the death of a character this is literally the drive around music but it&amp;#39;s for some reason it&amp;#39;s playing while we&amp;#39;re following a dog in the wake of somebody&amp;#39;s murder I&amp;#39;m here I&amp;#39;m going yeah they did not have a lot of tracks and it like if the game wasn&amp;#39;t goofy in other areas I would like it would be such an immersion break but this game&amp;#39;s just goofy in general so it&amp;#39;s like yeah I&amp;#39;m still here I&amp;#39;m still here keep going please keep going I&amp;#39;m following you bud keep going why is this dog taking the scenic route just go right to where you need to be you could have come over here earlier you goober you just ran in circles for no reason yeah you think you think that&amp;#39;s where we go where the blood went why do I need the dog to do that why did I need a Blog a Blog a dog to follow a blood trail apparently we need the dog to see the bright red blood trail we can&amp;#39;t progress until he&amp;#39;s over there the blood goes here but there&amp;#39;s nothing in here oh there&amp;#39;s a thing behind [Music] this Willie are you out there K what are you doing in there York is that you thank God I can&amp;#39;t get this door open can you unlock it from your side what is he even doing here stand away from the door he has no reason to be here where&amp;#39;s Diane and what are you doing here I was going to ask you the same thing well let&amp;#39;s just say I have my reasons you know private reasons I don&amp;#39;t really have to tell you do I actually you do Diane just died a moment ago meanwhile this johy funny music is playing thank God it end you&amp;#39;re not just a key witness now you&amp;#39;re now aect ECT and you need to tell me exactly what you were doing here well I just I just came here to talk with Diane to have a conversation and I suppose that kiss mark on your cheek is from your [Music] conversation this was just a Spur ofth the- moment thing which is exactly what killed Diane [Music] okay okay I came here to be with Diane you happy now we&amp;#39;ve been together before a couple times it&amp;#39;s one of the reasons why I like coming to this town see this time is no different I I I bumped into her in a bar in Seattle I had some some holiday coming up well so so I just took it and I drove her back here I have a wife you know but but we&amp;#39;ve been separated for a while we&amp;#39;re going through a divorce right now and I don&amp;#39;t want her lawyer finding out hatred of women that&amp;#39;s one of the things that uh there a profile of the killer anyway how could I kill Diane if I was in a room locked from the outside two hours ago me and Diane were taking it easy drinking upstairs we were you know enjoying ourselves then Nick had to show up well then Diane had a sudden change of heart she locked me up in here I&amp;#39;ve just been here waiting for her to come back of course but but she I heard footsteps a couple of times but they just passed by well then I couldn&amp;#39;t wait anymore so I let Willie here out through the window yeah we stopped checking people&amp;#39;s backs after this point and I don&amp;#39;t know why after that being a a crucial plot point in the chat first chapter that we just forget about it you showed up instead of Diane Zack Diane has become the third victim of our killer and nada from questioning Nick nothing got no new leads from questioning Nick he&amp;#39;s taken the death of Diane really badly in shock The Works he claims to have liked talking with her about art but he also had a problem with her views about men he says that they argued but not at a level that would lead to a murder they were about to head out to the bar again together but while he was waiting for Diane someone knocked him out cold he has no idea who it was either of course Cas looks like a prime suspect but that door was locked from the outside there was no other way in or out of that room how long had she even been up there which means there is no evidence of his involvement at this time he did say something else he does have an accomplice the footsteps he heard outside the room were not heels but a man&amp;#39;s boots and Nick was wearing boots but now that Diane&amp;#39;s dead no one can back up Nick&amp;#39;s statement which is why we have Nick in custody and have to let Cas Go free that seemed like the only option used for now one more thing Zach George looked terribly depressed I guess this case is really getting to him he&amp;#39;s feeling responsible for the deaths we&amp;#39;re getting close to him take his rules and confidence away from him I wonder what&amp;#39;s left maybe three well Tech George there he&amp;#39;d still have muscle forus could have uh murdered her and then George outside who could be our mole instead of Thomas comes in locks them in to provide a a safe Alibi goes yep I was just drunk I didn&amp;#39;t see anybody come in nope no lies to us is possible the whole town killed her everybody was around Zach let&amp;#39;s get back to the hotel first Anna then Becky now Diane I&amp;#39;m not looking forward to writing this investigation report Agent Morgan York you have a moment what is it George there&amp;#39;s something I&amp;#39;d like to talk to you about do you have any time later can&amp;#39;t we just do it here if possible I&amp;#39;d like to go to a bar of course we don&amp;#39;t really have to a bar now that sounds like a good idea Zach what do you think we can go drinking with George or turn him down and head back to the hotel uh I don&amp;#39;t know what the consequences of each choice are maybe I can I don&amp;#39;t know maybe I can not get closer to him the S to get closer to him but just to like see what he says see if I can catch him flipping or something to that extent George that scar on your cheek where did you get this didn&amp;#39;t I tell you well it&amp;#39;s not from work I got it when I was a kid a childhood injury tree climbing I used to get a few scrapes myself climbing the big tree in our backyard they&amp;#39;re not but I used to climb it a lot and fall out of it a lot this wasn&amp;#39;t anything like that though there&amp;#39;s my mother she did it hates women I&amp;#39;m sorry George problems with it&amp;#39;s ancient history the world is flooded with unreasonable violence the strong overpower the weak adults over children men over women and criminals over their victims I have no memories of my father he left before I knew him my mother would hit me every time I asked why one was abused by a woman the other divorced stopped there if I ate too slow left my shoes scattered around TV volume too loud she found reasons to hit me hit me bad the worst was what she called the tree punishment she&amp;#39;d whip my back with these thin tree branches like a whip please mama I won&amp;#39;t do it again hurts sorry tree punishment was definitely the worst I tell you just hearing those words used to make me shiver and want to pass out hurt people hurt people that&amp;#39;s why I didn&amp;#39;t want to show you those scars on my back every time after the tree punishment she&amp;#39;d always say the same thing this is hurting the tree more than it is hurting you and me being a naive dumb kid I believed her I went to the woods to apologize to the [Music] trees I kept asking myself why is she hurting me this way I thought long and hard about it in the end I just figured I&amp;#39;m weaker than her that&amp;#39;s why it&amp;#39;s the law of Mother Nature at work work the strong eat the weak but now you have the power to protect the weak that&amp;#39;s right perhaps I should thank my mother for guiding me into this line of work York I&amp;#39;ve been an arrogant fool haven&amp;#39;t I and if it weren&amp;#39;t for me both Becky and Diane would still be alive yes SP Reon I could have saved them both you know it&amp;#39;s almost like they died because of me you&amp;#39;re out of your mind I invited you to this bar for a drink but I guess this bar is my confection chamber and I wanted you to listen and to tell you well you must already hate me for causing all these problems not following your orders York I&amp;#39;m sorry I&amp;#39;ll follow your orders from now on you&amp;#39;ll have my total cooperation George you&amp;#39;ve been as Cooperative as you can be you even invited an FBI guy to a bar for drinks you&amp;#39;ve done a good job protecting this town and the folks here respect you for that nobody can blame you for anything thanks I do feel a little better hurt people hurt people the statement that I just said hurt people hurt people that&amp;#39;s especially true in crime and especially murder you&amp;#39;ve watched fictional crime True Crime a lot of crimes happen because hurt people are hurt and they hurt other people one of the uh I I like to watch or read or listen to a lot of True Crime especially when I&amp;#39;m working out something to have on in the background I think one of those things that really stood out to me a lot um when I was listening to one of the cases recently was that um uh after the perpetrator had you know carried out the evil Act of taking someone else&amp;#39;s life um he went he turned himself in like he immediately turned himself in he went to the neighbor&amp;#39;s house I believe it was of the person he had killed turned himself in and despite you know saying like hey you need to call the police I did this to someone uh they still like they they sat him on their porch they offered him water and the the thing that came out of that that the the Killer&amp;#39;s mouth that like kind of really stood out to me was like I don&amp;#39;t think anybody has ever been that nice to me before like he was actually like super shook in shock that like the the neighbors were being kind to him in spite of what he even just said um and it just kind of like stuck with me is that like you know obviously a lot more into that I won&amp;#39;t go into like the complete details of that but like he had had a really messed up past where he you know was very unloved treated very very poor and like that that&amp;#39;s why that kind of struck him as so bizarre because in his warped world where he had been hurt so much he didn&amp;#39;t expect that kindness to be possible what&amp;#39;s happening whoa whoa whoa what what hey Carol hello is dead Diane too I got this just by standing here you&amp;#39;ve got Nick in custody as a suspect Nick didn&amp;#39;t do it I know Carol you took a locket from Diane didn&amp;#39;t you a locket with this Mark on it would I have not gotten this if I wasn&amp;#39;t just standing there I&amp;#39;m busy got to go [ __ ] that&amp;#39;s suspicious oh she&amp;#39;s got to go sing right I&amp;#39;ll I&amp;#39;ll finish my explanation when I can my promise it&amp;#39;s relevant I&amp;#39;m not just rambling it&amp;#39;s relevant to what I&amp;#39;m thinking about What&amp;#39;s [Music] happen never saw Twin Peaks apparently supposedly yeah I&amp;#39;m an elephant a giant don&amp;#39;t [Music] [Music] [Music] yeah cuz I standing there I wasn&amp;#39;t even doing anything I don&amp;#39;t know how this got started [Music] [Music] [Music] she walk towards you I [Music] would what&amp;#39;s wrong with his eyes why does he look like that looks like he hav slept in a year okay anyways what I was saying is that you know like that that that case that I was I was listening to person would so hurt and maltreated their whole lives that eventually all that hurt that have been divvied out to that person they snapped and hurt someone else so so much so that even just being offered water on a porch step like freaked him out like he had he had never felt that level of like Simple Kindness from someone else and it&amp;#39;s just it&amp;#39;s interesting right and I think it&amp;#39;s kind of I can see the pieces coming together with this I know like you probably heard George&amp;#39;s like know past and you&amp;#39;re like oh you know I saw um say like poor guy and I&amp;#39;m I&amp;#39;m thinking like that according to our profile that yor has buil of the killer so far like that fits George has every not logical like a not logical but he has motive that matches the that aligns with the um that aligns with the uh with the with the killer or or The Killers right because that was like one of the first things that we notated uh in the uh in the in the morg initially was that there was an intense like distaste of women like there was a there was it was done like the murders are carried out with passion essentially like it&amp;#39;s not just a uh you know like I&amp;#39;m a cold blooded killer I don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s a it&amp;#39;s an emotional thing it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s a personal thing um so the characters that I&amp;#39;ve been kind of like and that&amp;#39;s this has happened mostly in the past like what seven hours we&amp;#39;ve been playing almost 7even hours we&amp;#39;ve been playing is I was like okay well there might be a mole in the police so that&amp;#39;s three people and there that I narrowed it down to like three people in the town itself is it going to do it again [ __ ] what is happening sorry to keep you waiting boys we keep getting random [ __ ] by standing here sack Emily is already a goddess of the forest hi [Music] siren let&amp;#39;s forget work for a bit and drink a little shall we a she cleaned up so nice why is she here I just thought the more the merrier you know to relax and get loose is this a problem no of course not pardon me Emily but I&amp;#39;m pooped I think I&amp;#39;ll just call it a night George I just got here and you&amp;#39;re walking out on me yeah she looks so nice too three of us could have a drink and let out a little steam I&amp;#39;m afraid I&amp;#39;ve already had enough and I already had a good manto man with York so I&amp;#39;ll see you guys guess I got go another day witho [ __ ] I think George likes you but he&amp;#39;s avoiding you all at the same time how astute there&amp;#39;s a reason nothing worth going into it&amp;#39;s a thing of the past they did they did they you know show each other their uh their going in the dark dinos were stickers okay he did ask me out when I first came to town I was still in high school he&amp;#39;s the he&amp;#39;s the but I never really considered him my type and there&amp;#39;s the age Gap thing too I respect that makes him a Pino mile job otherwi a phographer so did you move to this town alone of course not I came with my parents tell me about them then sure why not my dad dealt in stocks in New York he was hardly at home when I was a kid always working those pieces of paper were far more important to him than I was which is no different now really I I don&amp;#39;t see much of him it&amp;#39;s also that he takes to Emily who for most parts does not act very feminine as a female she was always kind and understanding not only that but she would always help me find my way she could be fierce too scolding me if I took a wrong step we had our battles sure but all in all she was a wonderful mother past tense yeah she&amp;#39;s gone now cancer just before I graduated high school I&amp;#39;m sorry she gave this to me just before she died I take it with me wherever I go it&amp;#39;s what I treasure most your hand oh I&amp;#39;m sure she&amp;#39;s very proud of you I had a good time tonight good night see you tomorrow York yes where&amp;#39;s your Pomo please don&amp;#39;t lie to us okay I won&amp;#39;t don&amp;#39;t worry I won&amp;#39;t wow that was something I think I could have skipped all that too like I could have just not even done any of that like I couldn&amp;#39;t even I could have just never even came here then I wouldn&amp;#39;t have got any of that at all I wonder how how I triggered all that would that have all went off anyway or is it because I just stood there you know wonder how much of that was me all right me stand under keep our homie as dry as I can um what I was saying earlier what I was saying earlier is that hurt people hurt people was the tldr and that George has like I was saying it&amp;#39;s the mo of the killer or killers from the distress and in plain uh the pain of like what his mother put him through and the the only female he seems to like think to is uh is uh Emily who acts for the most part not feminine she doesn&amp;#39;t wear makeup she&amp;#39;s likes she likes kicking Mac beer she&amp;#39;s into sports she&amp;#39;s she&amp;#39;s very you know has very like male oriented interests um and that&amp;#39;s like the female he likes I don&amp;#39;t think he&amp;#39;s married I don&amp;#39;t think he has kids like he we don&amp;#39;t see him favorably around other females besides the one that acts like know mostly on a male regard um so and Forest has reason to dislike else too cuz he&amp;#39;s he&amp;#39;s being put through a divorce which regardless of the emotional impact which is probably already extremely heavy it&amp;#39;s also extreme Financial press as well um so I don&amp;#39;t know maybe somewhere in a bar just like this one night a long time ago when the murders first started happening around the uh uh around the nation two men had a really really bad conversation and found out that they were hurt in the same way and hurt people hurt people so yeah something to think about something to think about remember how many years ago was it now that Multiple homicide of young girls in that college town all the victims were cut open from the throat to the crotch ripped right open during the autopsy a second stomach was found inside the first victim&amp;#39;s body of course she didn&amp;#39;t naturally know a second stomach one of the stomachs belonged to someone else more victims piled up there was one with two hearts one with two livers four lungs different organs each time of course those extra organs didn&amp;#39;t do the girls much good right Z then they say too much is Never Enough in the end we arrested a professor at the med school they found the body of his daughter dead and the missing organs at his house you remember what he said when we him I was ordered to restore those deformed bodies back to normal and remember who he said ordered him an alien well of course we couldn&amp;#39;t arrest an alien so we arrested the professor instead serial killers can&amp;#39;t be caught by Logic and common sense I learned this the hard way that first case taught me that since then these cases just keep getting more and complicated it&amp;#39;s a tough job I thought getting experience while I was young would make the job easier huh interesting did I expect that and even that shirt is ugly Zack let&amp;#39;s go over our progress from what Olivia told us and the Sketchbook we found at Becky&amp;#39;s house Nick and Diane became our primary Suspects there were a couple of reasons for this first Becky gave the missing locket to Diane also Nick has no alibi for when Anna and Becky were killed we followed Nick to the AR Gallery which led us unfortunately to our third victim the third victim Diane was strung up in the entrance hall of the Ark Gallery her hands were tied and a knife was sticking out however there was a marked difference from the previous crimes do you remember what that was Z that&amp;#39;s right Diane was still alive this suggests that very little time had pass since the crime was committed which means that which means the criminal was still close by yeah so that leaves only Nick Diane George in Forest Nick not doubt in the entrance Z who was the other person in the gallery yeah I think I would remember Harry being there got not a very uh he got a very distinct look we followed Willie good dog all the way to statement came out as follows he and Diane were in a physical relationship that was why he visited the gallery the two were in the middle of such a meeting when Nick showed up Diane lost her cool and shut Cas up in the basement now what did K hear when he was locked up his follows they were funkin that&amp;#39;s it they were hu boots passing BYU Nick was wearing boots that day which means it was likely that Diane met with Nick in her room Nick said he argued verbally with Diane about her playing around with men but they eventually decided to go out drinking to make up however immediately after that Nick was attacked by someone in the entrance hall and knocked unconscious we saw the rest Zack do you think that Nick is our serial killer there&amp;#39;s no no way George wasn&amp;#39;t standing outside that door and didn&amp;#39;t hear there&amp;#39;s ain&amp;#39;t no way George was just standing outside that door and didn&amp;#39;t hear that happen Ain no [ __ ] way he found a large volume of red seeds in dian&amp;#39;s stomach that&amp;#39;s no way confirms he&amp;#39;ve been staking that at place out for hours he didn&amp;#39;t hear that somebody getting murdered behind him locket which is in Carol&amp;#39;s possession the man the back and the upside down peace sign there&amp;#39;s a lot left to answer I hope the coffee will give us more guidance tomorrow he was drunk why did he get drunk the at one of the most important times where you wouldn&amp;#39;t have been drunk this has not been a character a character trait of his until it was conv I was surprised it&amp;#39;s the end of a monarchy any called me York instead of Agent Morgan he&amp;#39;s also starting to smoo up us right as we&amp;#39;re starting to get a little SAU Emily what&amp;#39;s going on do you know what time it is um I&amp;#39;m sorry I I couldn&amp;#39;t sleep so I was drinking alone [Music] my mother was a very kind woman she always smiled so brightly B cakes and cookies every day she&amp;#39;d say that I needed the sugar because I spent so much time thinking my father was always quiet we never talked much he was a federal agent just like me and he was hardly ever at home the only words he ever had for me were harsh ones I had a vivid imagination and I want some whistles instead yeah apparently one said this to me although I can imagine you just not getting it just about it dreaming them up she&amp;#39;s a goob my job to make sense out of them those pants I picked them what&amp;#39;s wrong found out later I picked that out one of the first to ever use criminal profiling to catch bad guys and so now I&amp;#39;m doing exactly the the same job that he did like father like son can I ask you something shoot mind if it&amp;#39;s something personal M fire away who&amp;#39;s Zach Zach is a friend of mine oh so you do have friends yeah he&amp;#39;s my only friend what what why don&amp;#39;t throw Emily under the bus like that y&amp;#39;all are friends shut the [ __ ] up I&amp;#39;ve never seen his face but he&amp;#39;s always with me are we actually Zach like are we at home Zach when did you become friends that&amp;#39;s funny as [ __ ] that&amp;#39;s like lit what&amp;#39;s happening long time ago okay maybe not he when I was a child okay maybe not maybe some weird Silent Hell [ __ ] never mind I was seven I woke up one morning to hear my mother crying in the living room this wasn&amp;#39;t normal so I haded in to see her escap so AG grossing how you hate this game my father was there pointing a gun at my mother I was so scared I closed my eyes so I I don&amp;#39;t remember much more that&amp;#39;s why all of those cases are like remember words my father said stopping female Killers cuz he&amp;#39;s like the inverted of them must Purge things from this world because they should not exist he&amp;#39;s the opposite even if it means losing someone that you love when I came back to my senses they were both dead he shot my mother and then killed himself oh oh I&amp;#39;m so sorry holy [ __ ] don&amp;#39;t worry about it Zach&amp;#39;s with me it was around that time that we became friends I&amp;#39;m here I&amp;#39;m with you he said I&amp;#39;ll be here always we can get through this together quite aside from that terrible scene in front of me that voice seemed to make me calmer and here we are working together getting through things this is the first time I&amp;#39;ve ever told anyone about this this actually has a lot grounding in Psychology wonder if Zach will get angry that&amp;#39;s a sad story but I don&amp;#39;t want you to take this the wrong way but I&amp;#39;m sure there was a reason for what your father did keep going CU I need to figure out like I think maybe I became an agent to find out why I need to you need to keep elaborating on that oh oh yeah York I I forgot to thank you thank me for what you saved my life oh that&amp;#39;s right we did do that if you didn&amp;#39;t save me at the gallery I would have died along with Diane no need to thank me for that I&amp;#39;m pretty useless I couldn&amp;#39;t save Becky I couldn&amp;#39;t save you don&amp;#39;t say that what did you just say useless I was never expecting to hear you say that huh there might be a modest guy in you after all finally you noticed you&amp;#39;re a little slow aren&amp;#39;t you maybe hopeless but not useless I also don&amp;#39;t want them to romance because they&amp;#39;re so like they&amp;#39;re such good friends do you think Emily got home safely they have such a good camaraderie anyway I think it&amp;#39;s more serious of a situation than I thought do you remember our conversation with Emily yeah I&amp;#39;m going to talk about that interested in you I think she&amp;#39;s starting to have certain feelings for you I mean it&amp;#39;s okay if they am romantic each other but I think they&amp;#39;re really they&amp;#39;re good as friends you and I are rivals is a very serious situation indeed I like their coder they banters dude well if it comes to that let it be a fair fight agreed Thomas Thomas let me out of here come on hey you may not be a murderer but you&amp;#39;re the very least a cheater so [ __ ] you [ __ ] oh you Thomas amazingly r at the same time yeah like I generally like their banter and like the psychology behind the characters is actually really well founded which is interesting Thomas Thomas like I was saying that&amp;#39;s why York is assigned to like female like solving f female murder cases or like chases those himself because he&amp;#39;s like the opposite the antithesis to these Killers who who have trauma and hate females like he&amp;#39;s he loved his mother very much and wants to stop things like what happened to his mother from happening again you know so he&amp;#39;s like the the antithesis who are murderers [Music] [Music] that look like a bird foot so that actually has a lot of like like substantial background in Psychology it is both a negative and a positive thing um so like um under times of like immense like trauma usually like one of the things that can happen and sometimes it&amp;#39;s what psychologists even suggest for you to like your therapist would suggest to you to do is obviously when we&amp;#39;re battling a demon um we&amp;#39;re battling a demon like internally like something that&amp;#39;s very abstract whether that be extreme anxiety extreme depression extreme guilt um it&amp;#39;s a very overwhelming feeling because it&amp;#39;s very like intangible it&amp;#39;s very just like like a up in the sky kind of like concept that it&amp;#39;s hard to wrestle which is why it takes so much control over you you is because like it is such an intangible thing it is just a very overpowering feeling so one of the um guess tactics would be the word that will uh that psychologists will employ is to visualize and name those things that way they become tangable and then you could either make peace with them bring them along with you like whatever right but essentially bringing that into a field of tangibility so like a perfect example from like a negative perspective which is the opposite of what um New York went through it was like if somebody has tremendous anger issues T like the the fury hatred like whatever uh a good example would be like okay well like what does it feel like and then you you just be like well it&amp;#39;s like you know it&amp;#39;s fire like it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s hot So like um you may you may start imagining it as like a flame or like um what does it remind you of it&amp;#39;s like it&amp;#39;s really strong and like powering so it&amp;#39;s like well maybe it&amp;#39;s like maybe it&amp;#39;s like a suit of armor like a night or something and just giving you that like kind of like that visualization of like when I am feeling this way it&amp;#39;s no longer just this thought just this abstract feeling that&amp;#39;s super strong but it is like a fire a knight a specific something that you can point to and confront makes it a lot easier to digest and in York&amp;#39;s case this is kind of like a an inverted part of the situation where like facing the death of his parents in such a violent way um he uh in terms of like as a guide a spiritual guide or something to pull him out of that negative situation materialized his hope and his just scratching for an overwhelming feeling of positivity that maybe Zach was born in that moment as you know naming and put tangibility to an overwhelming feeling that he needed so that he could pull himself through that and now it&amp;#39;s just something that he uses to cope with everything which is very interesting like I said very very very well founded and like this is this is a real psychological thing it&amp;#39;s a real thing in Psychology um so it&amp;#39;s very interesting very very interesting that a game about like a game where like you know like just all that quirkiness actually has a lot of like realistic grounding to it in the way that the characters are psychologically laid out you know which is like why like I think that like crime stories are so intriguing is the people behind them that&amp;#39;s also why I got into like social studies in history just as a subject was like not just the stories of what has happened to us in the past but why what was the mentality what were they thinking why did they do it what were they hoping would happen what ended up happening according to their intentions and what didn&amp;#39;t and that&amp;#39;s what factors into a lot of like crime stories and you know obviously like real life True Crime is like why and it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s a cool thing too because like um I&amp;#39;ve run you guys know that I&amp;#39;ve been playing Dungeons and Dragons I&amp;#39;ve mentioned this before I&amp;#39;ve played Dungeons and Dragons since I was like 12 um and like I was I&amp;#39;ve been a dungeon master which is like the leader of the game um multiple times and people usually congratulate me on like characters and villains they&amp;#39;re like that was really well written that was really T out they&amp;#39;re like how do you go about coming up with someone like that and I go what is their motivation like what do they want what do I want what are my resources to get what I want and how does that clash with my heroes is essentially what I bow that down to no matter what it&amp;#39;s like Star Wars typical D and D Pathfinder um whatever that the um the setting happens to be it&amp;#39;s like I am a villain what do I want why do I want this what resources do I have to accomplish this and how am I going to go about getting that and how does that conflict with my heroes basically all it boils down to and I think that&amp;#39;s like that&amp;#39;s how you write a good Crime Story is like getting the motivation behind not only your pro your antagonist obviously your protagonist like with York here it&amp;#39;s like it&amp;#39;s makes sense why they do the things they do you know why are they doing ABC like up billa&amp;#39;s point it seemed like mostly York&amp;#39;s just like a good guy you know he&amp;#39;s just really smart and a good person but there&amp;#39;s also is something deeply personal about you know kind of this maybe perhaps to an unhealthy extent kind of just like this enshrinement of women because his mother was like a do no wrong great figure in his life um had she done things wrong maybe and maybe that&amp;#39;s what Emily was trying to like kind of allude to was like was she really as perfect as you say she was or postmortem are you kind of like enshrining her putting on her pedestal higher than she was um but like either way that&amp;#39;s that was a an impactful moment or or that was an impactful moment and it keeps it keeps having hold of him his entire life essentially like he he work forever past this point and it is a positive thing in his life thankfully really is the opposite of these killers where he like inin women and loves women because of the great like view he had of his mom and how much he loved his mom so now he goes out there and tries to stop people from taking away mothers and you know daughters from other people so even just from like it got really complex you know like it isn&amp;#39;t just I&amp;#39;m generally a good guy so I do good things it&amp;#39;s like he has a personal motivation that maybe he&amp;#39;s not even fully aware of aware of or fully accepting that is psychologically driving him to do the morally good things that he does which makes him a good character you know very goofy and serious and once you take it seriously does a really good job it does it does it&amp;#39;s really good it knows when to [ __ ] around and make you laugh and then actually do something really emotionally impactful when it wants to it&amp;#39;s actually a a [ __ ] fantastic game it&amp;#39;s great it&amp;#39;s [ __ ] wild you&amp;#39;re saying a shrimp friers rice I sure I&amp;#39;m just going to say yes for whatever reason I&amp;#39;m just going to say previously during the investigation so you want to find out everything there is to know about Diane agent York Nick is leaving the bar wait she&amp;#39;s still alive stop right there Nick you&amp;#39;re under arrest for the attempted and if you&amp;#39;re noticing the people that they&amp;#39;re killing are like a little promiscuous right which there&amp;#39;s nothing wrong with that but like from a very traditional M view that is like a negative bad thing that you shouldn&amp;#39;t do according to like the patriarchy right so like we haven&amp;#39;t seen this in a while so like their victims are very definitely picked based off of like they&amp;#39;re definitely not picked by accident so to speak if that Mak sense what in the lost one is happening I can&amp;#39;t even follow the music there is no music oh there&amp;#39;s music but it&amp;#39;s not directional what is happening oh hi who the what the hello who the hell is this person I agree open this door there is no turning back you still want to enter I do it&amp;#39;s better than staying here interesting very well then off you go oh man look carefully boy at times we must Purge things from this world because they should not exist even if it means losing someone that you love [Music] this is such an emotional moment it&amp;#39;s just rued by that [Music] [Music] hey Dr good to see you sapling the sapling is there or sapling is in Emily flash for the shirt on yeah who does that nobody I know does that Mr Morgan do you want to refill yes thank you okay new Theory poly is the coffee that good Mr Morgan coffee is a vital investigative tool I know exactly what to do now yeah please change sleeping them that&amp;#39;s gross it says to hurry and the first letter of each line is h a r r y hurry to Harry looks like the time that he was talking about has come let&amp;#39;s go pay the problematic rich boy who owns half of the Town a visit poly I think I&amp;#39;m going to go see Harry today oh really he&amp;#39;s a little strange but I think he&amp;#39;s the most trustworthy one around here I think you&amp;#39;ll have fun with him if you say so Polly then we probably will of course now give me your cup and I&amp;#39;ll give you some more coffee he&amp;#39;s trying so hard I&amp;#39;ll see you later Polly paully doesn&amp;#39;t have a good hearing that&amp;#39;s why he&amp;#39;s talking like that going to make sure she hears Mr Morgan what about the copy don&amp;#39;t you want to refill your cofy poor old Polly she&amp;#39;s so bored around here this is the most exciting like three Monon period of her life probably at this point hey cool all right first off let&amp;#39;s save you&amp;#39;re so [ __ ] good how could anybody hate this video game I I legitimately I want an essay on why why people hate this [ __ ] game CU I I get it like it&amp;#39;s like even if you hate the Hokey moments the good moments are so [ __ ] good like how could how could you ignore that or you just not or they just not play that far cuz reviewers suck all right box take out the turkey sandwich we&amp;#39;re going to throw these away so we&amp;#39;re going to take these out just to get rid of them I think it&amp;#39;s like it&amp;#39;s striking the reason it works is because it&amp;#39;s striking a balance right cuz you imagine a game like like I remember not a game but I remember like playing stuff like heavy rain and that [ __ ] would get exhausting after a while cuz it was just like non-stop sad with like no humor and no hope you know and I think it&amp;#39;s like despite that game also being really good it&amp;#39;s like I&amp;#39;m not going to hold you that game got really exhausting sometime because of how Dreadful it was you know cuz it was such a sad and heavy game hence the name Heavy Rain um but uh the guy yeah that&amp;#39;s the game where the guy&amp;#39;s like Jason Jason but yeah it&amp;#39;s like I like that this game has that uh that dichotomy all shits are being cleaned put this one okay it rain heavy yeah that is well it&amp;#39;s named heavy rain because it&amp;#39;s the the Origami Killer kills people by drowning them with rain water why it&amp;#39;s called everyy R we I have $1,300 cuz I don&amp;#39;t work for free I get paid I get paid for doing my job as an FBI FBI agent I&amp;#39;m going to stock up on supplies $20 for a [ __ ] donut must be the best donut ever hot dog woo [Music] never went back I mean I I mean that that&amp;#39;d be a really good career path to be honest obiously very altruistic one certain [Music] bar de good [Music] [Music] question or something R not even liking it it seems like you have a passion for it just by way you talk about it but obviously I can&amp;#39;t you [Music] know can&amp;#39;t fully say that just by what you said alone let&amp;#39;s talk to you what&amp;#39;s going on why not invite a girl at your own age what about [Music] Emily okay what the [ __ ] are you doing here hey am I still a suspect yes no what yes you are okay well good yes you are my wife and I have been living separately for over three years now how long kill this been she&amp;#39;s a single woman so this shouldn&amp;#39;t be a problem that&amp;#39;s true I feel so bad for Diane though gosh did did you find out who did it I can&amp;#39;t discuss that yes of course I I understand you don&amp;#39;t have to tell any of the folks around town about me and Diane do you no I won&amp;#39;t do that but it&amp;#39;s a small town I&amp;#39;m sure the rumors have started already nothing to be ashamed of right what&amp;#39;s there to worry about nothing in particular no nothing at all I&amp;#39;m clean as clean as the sheets in this hotel what&amp;#39;s with that look we don&amp;#39;t have a problem right it looks like Cas is involved with another woman in town we can only hope it isn&amp;#39;t Emily what&amp;#39;s that a little jealousy that I heard there Mr [ __ ] York what Mr York Morgan was that was that a little bit of jealousy that I just [ __ ] heard out of your mouth I heard that [Music] he tipped his hand a little there is she okay she was trying to pop her back way she ran over you I can&amp;#39;t find Thomas was he here no I haven&amp;#39;t seen him have you tried the radio I&amp;#39;ve been trying but he&amp;#39;s not answering what about Nick no problem with him he&amp;#39;s calmed down a little he&amp;#39;s still saying he didn&amp;#39;t do it Nick said that Thomas disappeared sometime during the night he kept calling for him but Thomas stopped responding she&amp;#39;s starting to do the thing he does George has asked for permission to search for Thomas I understand that things have been hard for Thomas but surely he&amp;#39;s just resting at home but I&amp;#39;m not against looking for him tell George that he has my blessing never notic it it is okay as far as I know th that&amp;#39;s his little tick is where he Taps his collar bone and now she&amp;#39;s doing it as far as you know there haven&amp;#39;t been any serial killings here before right that&amp;#39;s right but that&amp;#39;s not Emily I&amp;#39;m going to see Harry today what why we have plenty of other leads to follow don&amp;#39;t we he did invite me over though it would be bad maners not to acbm are you really an FBI agent I think the FBI would take a more logical approach to investigations but Emily serial killer does not stay within the boundaries of logic [ __ ] true thus you can&amp;#39;t hope to capture such

hinge yeah so I&amp;#39;m about my first impression we met her on that bridge is slightly different from what I think about her now don&amp;#39;t you think she&amp;#39;s pretty mesmerized and Zach she seemed interested in you did you make a move on her no don&amp;#39;t answer just asking but if you like her I won&amp;#39;t stand in your way but I&amp;#39;d like to hear the truth because this kind of stuff could affect our friendship you know me I&amp;#39;m just interested in her that&amp;#39;s all it doesn&amp;#39;t love or anything from what I can tell she doesn&amp;#39;t even seem to like me it&amp;#39;s pretty clear from how she acts when she&amp;#39;s around me as you know Zach I&amp;#39;m cautious with women it&amp;#39;s because I was badly burned in my last relationship tell me about it I really have no idea what women are thinking that&amp;#39;s my problem you&amp;#39;re pretty friendly with the ladies I don&amp;#39;t enjoy this conversation anymore maybe you should teach me about how to interact with women okay anyways now that I&amp;#39;ve been emotionally wounded by a [ __ ] T Lakes meme game let&amp;#39;s get into the driveway BR what what you hit a fence I know I&amp;#39;m not thinking straight was occupied by by SS anyways uh [ __ ] mailbox and yeah I it&amp;#39;s not for everybody to be honest I think I&amp;#39;ve had more happiness recently in my life in like the past 3 or four months than single than I have my entire life and it was just something that I just you know as somebody who&amp;#39;s been just going to take your a I&amp;#39;ve been in a relation I&amp;#39;ve been in a long-term relationship basically since I was 16 not the same one although mostly it was one so being single is kind of weird I really enjoy being alone a lot like a lot a lot so it&amp;#39;s not the worst thing in the world not saying I&amp;#39;ll never be with anybody again but like I don&amp;#39;t know I&amp;#39;m about being by myself that I&amp;#39;ve really come to Love and Enjoy why do she why does she sound like a [ __ ] answering machine wait where is all I hear [Music] is what&amp;#39;s this Nick asked me to give it to you it&amp;#39;s a letter from him to you Nick wrote this for me Olivia I&amp;#39;m sorry for all the trouble I am causing you I&amp;#39;m writing this letter because I need to tell you some things first I&amp;#39;m sorry about meeting with Diane without telling you cheer my actions were irresponsible and may have caused you to misunderstand but I swear to God I was not cheating on you and I didn&amp;#39;t kill Diane that&amp;#39;s what I wanted to tell you as I sit here in this all I can think about is you don&amp;#39;t worry about keeping the Diner open okay try to eat well too I had thought that this happiness we had would just go on forever I&amp;#39;ve always been grateful to you but I&amp;#39;ve never told you have I I used to think that putting it into words made it sound cheap but at times like these words are all we need thank you for everything once I get home I&amp;#39;ll make it up to you take care of yourself I love you Nick um agent could you wait a moment please I want to write a reply sure go ahead thank you all so I got to return this zck I hope Nick will feel better by this turn to better things back to the police station with us well that all look creepy what did I just hit hello what am I what is happening what are we good what the [ __ ] what was that I&amp;#39;m scared oh no I don&amp;#39;t know what the [ __ ] was happening there but I&amp;#39;m scared Zach did you want to go somewhere before we visit Harry oh man that&amp;#39;s fine by me I mean people suck in general men suck generally a lot yeah but people suck in general there&amp;#39;s just a general selfishness out there and a lot of empathy so that makes being you know in just in any sort of relationship with people that feel much less romantic you know and romantic even worse wish it was different the best you can be is not one of those people it&amp;#39;s the only thing you can do you can&amp;#39;t change people than AR they got to learn on their own huh [Music] it&amp;#39;s a letter from Olivia from Olivia what the I wrote so much more than i&amp;#39; I&amp;#39;d ever actually say a lot more than this and she writes me need three lines back not enough for you oh no no it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s more than enough she wrote as much as she could that&amp;#39;s the best she could do right now yeah three powerful lines I believe in you I&amp;#39;ll wait for you I&amp;#39;m sorry I I don&amp;#39;t agree with the last one though I&amp;#39;m the one who asked to apologize do you feel a little better now then just wait until the case is finished I promise this will all come to an end yeah I I know I I believe you she&amp;#39;s believing in me too and waiting for me well I have to be going hold hold on a [Music] minute what&amp;#39;s this the key to the back door of the diner there&amp;#39;s a big bag in the kitchen I don&amp;#39;t know if you could use it but consider it yours you&amp;#39;ll have to help yourself to it of course I I can&amp;#39;t exactly go with you okay I&amp;#39;ll take take this and I&amp;#39;ll go check it out looks like a return to better things for those two ASAC that&amp;#39;s good I&amp;#39;m happy that ended fine saved your relation it&amp;#39;s like what&amp;#39;s that one quote brand too that you said the one time brand saved my relationship paid my mortgage and uh something else paid off my house I don&amp;#39;t know it&amp;#39;s like that one all over again 24 so it went up what I got fine for breaking the street light this so tragic learn my lesson I&amp;#39;m going to run this red light do I get fine for that too oh it&amp;#39;s this door terrible to me why why are they terrible to you I don&amp;#39;t mean in any way that like you deserve it somehow just curious Nick was like if you could use it but Zach this is great we&amp;#39;ll be able to carry more items now Zach whoa that&amp;#39;s cool hey that&amp;#39;s neat I like [Music] that too sensitive too kind loving without boundaries is not good a bad habit I had for so [ __ ] long so [ __ ] long not good you think you&amp;#39;re doing good but you&amp;#39;re not just doesn&amp;#39;t work that way thing they did would break it yeah that&amp;#39;s like that&amp;#39;s what happens you know CU they&amp;#39;re so used to you you know people get so used to you like toing the line and being the backbone and everything that when you start putting your own Backbone in place they get upset the only way to not be in that situation not going to do it in the first place unfortunately I get in that situation in the first place we have a lot to do with the junkyard and there&amp;#39;s another uh hot lady take her home Quest over there too I didn&amp;#39;t mean to do that again I wish I could have cats again I&amp;#39;d rather be in my own place again before doing that I would want to keep them cooped up in here want to be happy I should be able to get there without the map to be honest I kind of vaguely remember where they were at if I&amp;#39;m wrong I&amp;#39;m wrong but let&amp;#39;s see if we can anyway Z there AR many young women left in this town even Emily could be targeted next can&amp;#39;t Ru that out don&amp;#39;t even joke about all the more reason to catch the rco killer inap that means working closely together we can work out the Emily situation later don&amp;#39;t get me wrong I mean I&amp;#39;m not interested in Emily because she&amp;#39;s female saying she&amp;#39;s I don&amp;#39;t know that&amp;#39;s kind of weird Gore I&amp;#39;m not going to hold you it&amp;#39;s kind of odd NOP you&amp;#39;re not Ed to anybody&amp;#39;s time that&amp;#39;s kind of weird to kind of weird to get pissy with somebody for like when I first like when I quote unquote ignore people it&amp;#39;s because I&amp;#39;m going through tremendous mental health situations that like would not want to put on someone else I can&amp;#39;t speak for your friend but to assume you know better on how what to do with their time is kind of I don&amp;#39;t know if I would do that anyways we&amp;#39;re getting closer one step at a time to cracking this case I have a feeling it&amp;#39;s going to get tough they done it sply yeah but just in the in general in general like as just a feeling of like don&amp;#39;t ignore me it upsets me it&amp;#39;s like it&amp;#39;s not always a negative reason that they&amp;#39;re ignoring you I did almost get this right the first time we&amp;#39;re not going to do pot lady first appus well if you you said in general that&amp;#39;s a feeling that you have I don&amp;#39;t not up to that situation but just keep that in mind for in general no I didn&amp;#39;t you you did but not worth arguing about you I could literally scroll up and show you the message but before it like I guess you have potential Soldier we&amp;#39;ll find that wondering why it takes me to that menu it&amp;#39;s not like that menu helps me at all oh I can just I didn&amp;#39;t know I could d-pad that out you play Pokemon only using ghost Heights because that horror no probably not I don&amp;#39;t know if I have you saved recently uh right before I drove over to the side of town yeah there&amp;#39;s not a save point over here so like yeah if it&amp;#39;s if it&amp;#39;s if it&amp;#39;s a sensitive topic perhaps it&amp;#39;s not worth not worth talking about it Quick Cash yeah I don&amp;#39;t wonder what the wonder why they just like know like did you see him like his leg up when he was pulling his gun out there that was funny we have to go through the whole thing that time close do you think you are to what close to what exactly the end probably not even close remotely there&amp;#39;s a lot of side quests and stuff to do in this game keep myself occupied what we can buy cars what whoa whoa this is cool oh that&amp;#39;s neat okay so we don&amp;#39;t have to drive the police [Music] cars this is it this will save your life someday son what&amp;#39;s the story this this time speed determines everything on the battlefield life or death you&amp;#39;re not going to tell me another story about stomach pains are you son I told you already don&amp;#39;t mock your superiors it&amp;#39;s a very serious story this time it starts with a question why did we lose the battle we had Firepower and the air support in the beginning but scary a war of attrition we learned a lesson we lacked speed when speed was needed it was our superior&amp;#39;s fault we should have carried out a swifter attack that would have saved more of our soldiers although crybaby Timothy was doomed either way you really hated that Sergeant didn&amp;#39;t you don&amp;#39;t talk to me with that tone boy words cannot describe how much I hated him I was at war with a crybaby no one has enough lives to survive that he poisoned us with our own food washed all our weapons with soap and water launched a signal flare thinking it was a firework set off countless traps laid by the enemy more than half of the unit had to return home sick because of him I don&amp;#39;t know how much of this to believe believe as much as you like I&amp;#39;ll keep my side of the promise and get to work on your veh vehicle well if he hates that Sergeant so much why does he keep talking about him good question and would a general really even have direct contact with a sergeant questions keep mounting credit Su I&amp;#39;ve increased your exhaust and optimized your higher gears that means you can drive at a faster top speed but there&amp;#39;s still plenty of stuff I can do to make your car go faster just

half of the game except more annoying like the game&amp;#39;s not even finished you can say it did things cool for like what it was like what it attempted like you can&amp;#39;t say it&amp;#39;s objectively a good game I don&amp;#39;t think I get how people say that about that game I feel like any any game releasing in 2023 that would make you backtrack through half of the game all over again except worse is like that nobody would ever be cool with that but because it&amp;#39;s it was Silent Hill po it gets it gets a pass essentially Mr Francis York Morgan please have some tea while it is hot too much coffee for your body will make it rot okay you seem well prepared almost as though you knew I would be coming today Mr Stewart is particular about the best timing for all things now please drink some tea and enjoy the good health it brings I&amp;#39;m sorry Harry but I just don&amp;#39;t like tea he Whispering or like how is he communicating here Mr Francis York Morgan some tea

of Common Sense the hard way Zach and that&amp;#39;s it huh that a very small section for the Silent Hill stuff I don&amp;#39;t think any of the other parts have actually been that short when it comes to the monster attacks once again Still&amp;#39;s never been explaining why that happens Mak can you grenade game hasn&amp;#39;t explained it yet either so you think about this point they what have which is the funny part what is that behind you the green tomato for let&amp;#39;s go see which way do we want to go coming out of here left or right looks like lot that&amp;#39;s like guy was taking

happening what what do you want stupid [ __ ] [ __ ] rich people am I right [ __ ] stupid [ __ ] lame [ __ ] time wasting [ __ ] I&amp;#39;m just a [ __ ] toy to him run around do my stupid little puzzles I certainly know there&amp;#39;s no fun to be had here okay what where are you [Music] [Music] [Music] this is thrilling I&amp;#39;m glad this rich man is forcing me to do this random weird [Music] [ __ ] this is tedious as [ __ ] what if you don&amp;#39;t get the right [ __ ] combination this is going to take [ __ ] forever what the [ __ ] were they thinking [Music] [Music] just got I did not miss all right that makes me want to [Music] cry we got that one right this is incredibly tedious either way [Music] imagine if you didn&amp;#39;t read that thing before you came in here were attempting this like how awful this would be that sounds terrible [Music] [Music] wait no other way other way brother not not [Music] forward yeah this way [Music] all right am I done being your entertainment now you stop [ __ ] around when literally we&amp;#39;re trying to solve a murder here you weirdo oh cool anent honor surely he doesn&amp;#39;t mind if I just you know certainly you didn&amp;#39;t hear that right Sir Francis York Morgan could you not release your Firearms discharge your Firearms inside our humble establishment what what do you want lock something probably no where the [ __ ] do I go the memes are over where the [ __ ] do I go it wasn&amp;#39;t honey the first time and now it&amp;#39;s not funny anymore I go the other way went left last time I go right you be annoying on your time not mine my time on this planet is finite there you go why is it taking so long for him to walk in the scene so dramatic hot turns out what you said was true and I&amp;#39;d like to hear more said to tell Sir Francis York Morgan that he is a little [ __ ] York as you know there&amp;#39;s a powerful mystery surrounding these seeds you&amp;#39;ve seen them at those other murders that took place elsewhere and you&amp;#39;ve seen them deeply involved with the murders in this town as well that&amp;#39;s right but how do you know all this York you must be younger than you look youngsters tend to hurry so much that they let things slip right past them uhhuh what you need to do is slow this down a bit that way you&amp;#39;ll see what&amp;#39;s really important let me tell you a story yeah he&amp;#39;s clearly moving his mouth 50 years ago when the was over just about communist almost as a rising threat Our Town constructed a huge Clock Tower ah I then soon afterwards a serial killer wearing a red raincoat went on a killing spree the legend of the raincode killer stop playing games with me Harry that&amp;#39;s nothing more than folklore the it is it cuz I the rain killer the original homicide case in this town York Anna Becky and now Diane their deaths are real not folklore not Legend the raincoat killer is all so real he&amp;#39;s me but under a strict gag order the mass murder case was never made public in fact one could say that it was completely erased from history now why would they do that tell me who do you think would be able to do something like that the military very good a mder student but if there are no records about it how do you know what really happened good question York why would I know this CU you&amp;#39;re the killer the answer is very simple the original one anyways I was there I saw it with my own eyes in the reflection brutal killer himself but we can talk about the details of that encounter another time no no you tell me we need to talk about is your raincoat killer the new raincoat killer you stop play the old raincoat killer the new raincoat killer yes let&amp;#39;s call him that after all he&amp;#39;s not the real one uhhuh what you want to know more about is the new one between 20 years ago I noticed that these red seeds were special and someone else did do human imagination can lead to let me just crack a smoke out Mansion someone linked the red seeds to the serial killer Legend who said if you eat the red seeds and then kill someone you will become immortal this new good to see you how are you tonight change it every time like a rumor some may have actually taken the seeds to try them out to prove the legend of that is York the red seeds you have found from those other bir where did your modulator go they all came from this town suffering same why are you suffering people on the other side back have heard of itop and new seeds might be growing in different parts of the world so you&amp;#39;re saying that the series of cases I&amp;#39;ve been following are all linked to this town that&amp;#39;s interesting Harry interesting but there&amp;#39;s no evidence to support that story none of the criminals we caught for the other murders ever mentioned anything like that it&amp;#39;s your job your Ro and duty to look into that now be scared to sleep in the game again oh you know I said I&amp;#39;m only an act two so I probably haven&amp;#39;t hit whatever scary thing you&amp;#39;re talking about well not quite records still exist in the Sheriff&amp;#39;s Office the old Sheriff back then at the military and did his own investigation I need you to bring those documents here to me once you&amp;#39;ve done that I&amp;#39;ll tell you everything I know Friday experience again that&amp;#39;s really good that&amp;#39;s really cool then and we may as well let the old man have his fun you know he&amp;#39;s very obviously the old killer like the old uh killer like yeah let let&amp;#39;s just let the old man have his fun yeah could you bring him in or something he literally just admitted to being a like the old serial killer or very heavily implied he was he&amp;#39;s like yeah whatever what a quirky old guy what a weirdo documents from a case that happened 50 years ago let play along with the old man for a little longer shall we Zach that means we need to head for the sheriff&amp;#39;s department so your cards right I don&amp;#39;t know about that I don&amp;#39;t know I mean I hope it isn&amp;#39;t it&amp;#39;s that cool but knowing me I&amp;#39;ll miss something we Zoom doing goblins again so you&amp;#39;re you&amp;#39;re basically uh not basically but you&amp;#39;re getting close to anac one if you&amp;#39;ve already taken care of the three homies P Goblin homies so where shall we go next you boost this car no you can&amp;#39;t but I already go faster than the fastest speed on a uh on a boosted car so on the boosted police car so I&amp;#39;m cool I&amp;#39;m I&amp;#39;m chilling Moonlight Tower if you just killed the goblin stuff you have a lot more to do before you get to the moonrise towers with the top down yeah we don&amp;#39;t and we can&amp;#39;t put our top up we&amp;#39;re just stuck driving like this uhuh uhhuh we I did see a little Quest marker on them which is curious so I&amp;#39;m kind of let&amp;#39;s talk quick th that only like strong men okay interesting so we essentially asked if Thomas uh interesting he&amp;#39;s going between the Raindrop yeah we&amp;#39;ll do gas first at the car wash okay well we got durability and our stuff back up now I notic they have a little side P mark on them yeah I&amp;#39;m that&amp;#39;s currently where I&amp;#39;m at weird yeah that&amp;#39;s currently where I&amp;#39;m at in the game it&amp;#39;s like everybody&amp;#39;s like I keep trying to do everything and anything besides you know going to moonrise Towers like no bra everything&amp;#39;s moonrise Towers everything is moonrise Towers HEI we moonrise Towers I&amp;#39;m like okay fine I&amp;#39;ll go to this damn place [ __ ] everything bottlenecks at [ __ ] moonrise Towers nothing just my imagination we just filled up we used 4% going fast comes at a [ __ ] price holy [ __ ] I&amp;#39;ll tell you what filling up a lot in this car this gas 50c is [ __ ] terrible can there really be documents here that the FBI doesn&amp;#39;t even have be so ni what do you think Zack York I told you that&amp;#39;s nothing more than local folklore fuore Harry said that he was there the rainco Killer is a phantom made up to scare children long ago I can&amp;#39;t believe you fell for that from Harry of all people I agree with George Harry likes to play with people play with their mind yeah CU he was a murderer George Emily of course I don&amp;#39;t believe him word for word but you won&amp;#39;t mind if I at least try to confirm that he&amp;#39;s wrong will you Basel well then can you look for the files by yourself goshan I can&amp;#39;t stand aan sometimes I don&amp;#39;t hate him but he&amp;#39;s just he&amp;#39;s just him why why are we going to Sil world supposed to look for these what the [ __ ] I really wish the game would explain why we&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re here too Zach why we keep going this might mean we&amp;#39;re getting warmer to what we need [ __ ] what do you mean [ __ ] that guy I would [ __ ] me too I&amp;#39;m so hot think I going can I get my gun out thank you don&amp;#39;t want to [Music] die carlac Carl&amp;#39;s cool car&amp;#39;s a homie

this one scene that I&amp;#39;ll keep as brief as possible haven&amp;#39;t got to it where they&amp;#39;re just like are we friends and they&amp;#39;re like I would go that far it actually legitimately cracked me the [ __ ] up see the DD campaign that part 3 started no I have not but I have been seeing posts about it I&amp;#39;ve been seeing posts about it but no I do not I have not personally seen it my I work my workouts work how big my shoulder is you you put that away stop show that off not for free what the [ __ ] my [ __ ] shoulder was coming out of my shirt like relax shoulder wheel yeah not for free not for free no no no don&amp;#39;t get out of yourselves that&amp;#39;s can of pickles I&amp;#39;m so excited yeah let&amp;#39;s go oh can of pineapples I actually love pineapples pineapples not going to lie to you pineapples are probably my favorite food I don&amp;#39;t like pineapple flavored things too much but the actual pineapples like the actual fruit itself I could [ __ ] eat that all day it&amp;#39;s so good this Florida is like I don&amp;#39;t want to die you guys shut the [ __ ] up oh my gosh don&amp;#39;t you shoot me I don&amp;#39;t think you killed me there&amp;#39;s can of pickles there&amp;#39;s can of pickles the best side character there&amp;#39;s a shotgun you didn&amp;#39;t pick up yeah I don&amp;#39;t know I thought I was going to be in the hospital but like it never happened iel like I tried to be as th as I could in the hospital but I guess I wasn&amp;#39;t oh [ __ ] get off of me I mean that&amp;#39;s fine is there an infinite shotgun like there&amp;#39;s infinite of the other weapons cuz I much rather have that than the noral shotgun anyway we&amp;#39;ll be honest they&amp;#39;re both Petty and it kills me it&amp;#39;s true it&amp;#39;s very very true my favorite lasel or Las my favorite Shadow heart seems you try to give her the flower and it&amp;#39;s just just like that&amp;#39;s poisonous kidding got you I was like that was cute that was cute that was adorable that&amp;#39;s some [ __ ] I would do excuse me why did he do what why did he Crouch for a second overwhelms me that&amp;#39;s kind of why I don&amp;#39;t end up playing that game a lot I&amp;#39;m very happy that my uh best flesh friend plays it with me all the time cuz like solo I don&amp;#39;t think I would have the motivation to play it because it is so overwhelming so much lucky he&amp;#39;s beating it before so we&amp;#39;re just kind of like vibing doing the combat not getting super invested in the plot but paying attention enough that it matters I so we found out that the Zack looks like we need to continue our search Kill ah flashbang ah George I&amp;#39;ll get right to the point it looks like someone else has just removed the documents I&amp;#39;m looking for huh removed so there&amp;#39;s looks like it had been forced open that&amp;#39;s impossible no one could break into there unless there was an Insider Emily there is one person that can access that room at any time you don&amp;#39;t mean Thomas it&amp;#39;s too early to speculate and profiling is my job remember more importantly Emily could you get me a coffee a fresh one if possible coffee at a time like this hey that&amp;#39;s your homie that&amp;#39;s your buddy you don&amp;#39;t [ __ ] send her coffee this is very important some coffee and bring some milk on the side [Music] Zach you know something don&amp;#39;t you I&amp;#39;m getting us some coffee so tell me what you know FK [ __ ] Zach this is amazing even the taste of her coffee is thrilling to say the least what stop being mean to her nothing how do you make coffee bad this isn&amp;#39;t the cup that Thomas always uses for me is it I&amp;#39;m sorry about that too then I just used a cup that was nearby you have a problem with that problem Mom and Dad stop fighting here Emily the coffee is perfect W well okay taste aside this cup certainly is perfect George Emily we&amp;#39;re going to Velvet Falls there&amp;#39;s something waiting for us there I can feel it York are you joking you&amp;#39;re trusting your cup no Emily going to to a waterfall just might be a good idea in fun a waterfall is known as a source of power even if we find nothing there I&amp;#39;m sure it will give us some power thanks for the vote of confidence George and don&amp;#39;t forget to bring a fishing rod all right I&amp;#39;ll go get it fishing are you too serious George do you have a net Em&amp;#39;s about hi it with us I Haven been two weeks in in game time yet

the [ __ ] is this what what is this why is there a face of emilyy in that what the [ __ ] is going on I can&amp;#39;t believe anyone would throw trash into such a beautiful waterfall ah yes unbelievable environmental King tell him W nowy that&amp;#39;s funny recasting is usually a bad thing you don&amp;#39;t want to do that cuz the more you scare the fish the more they&amp;#39;re not going to bite fra we do stand fra we got trash again this [ __ ] sucks we&amp;#39;re terrible at fishing chat I&amp;#39;m not terrible fishing in real life I promise more trash don&amp;#39;t know what did I [ __ ] catch a DVD player what happened bad at fishing right now let you can prove them some patient yeah that&amp;#39;s kind of the key being patient hey wait failed what we don&amp;#39;t want Emily I I disagree my tie is stuck in my chest it&amp;#39;s stabbing me through the [ __ ] sturum this is not good why is Emily bad I have questions yeah we got fish boys do I remember one time I caught a fish and I didn&amp;#39;t know if you if you rub your hands the opposite way of the scales that they&amp;#39;re sharp and [ __ ] cut my hand found that out there the blue didn&amp;#39;t not know that [ __ ] we got trash again can we skip this yes we can I love how they just keep you they&amp;#39;ll just keep you in this [ __ ] mini game until you [ __ ] get that this like the [ __ ] what you can fail this that&amp;#39;s the first time I&amp;#39;ve ever fished what the [ __ ] that&amp;#39;s like a hard fail [Music] State what what huh first time I ever did this mini game like what the [ __ ] don&amp;#39;t don&amp;#39;t be a dick about it that&amp;#39;s I&amp;#39;m having fun with the mini game okay like I don&amp;#39;t want to progress you&amp;#39;re getting my ass if I&amp;#39;m enjoying having fun in your video game everything about that even catch anything on that first gu York you got to you got to [ __ ] catch something brother what the [ __ ] letting me do the mini game now D&amp;#39;s best yeah apparently his best is not a whole lot no I stopped it too early [ __ ] this is so sad such I&amp;#39;m so bad at everything I just want to cry piss and [ __ ] cry in the club throw up you know all that wonderful stuff life is pain life is a gift but it is pain gift of pain sure Tri gift of pain there you go see we made it all work out this will make life easier yeah please at least [ __ ] catch something we&amp;#39;ve had one attempt these no I was one off I&amp;#39;m going to cry I&amp;#39;m going to cry I&amp;#39;m going to cry I&amp;#39;m going to cry I&amp;#39;m going to cry I&amp;#39;m going to cry that one off the fisherman I&amp;#39;m I&amp;#39;m I I can catch the fish it&amp;#39;s just like I&amp;#39;m not catching the thing I need to catch a [ __ ] special object or whatever the [ __ ] that&amp;#39;s rooting my fun way George is supposed to be fishing too what the [ __ ] is he doing no it&amp;#39;s off by one I hate [ __ ] I don&amp;#39;t hate living life is just pain sometimes looks like something&amp;#39;s pulling on your on your Rod what what do you mean you&amp;#39;re not getting anything I just weirdly feel like one of those golf games from the PS2 I know it&amp;#39;s just like the camera angle and the [ __ ] the coziness of the uh environment around you hey we did it good fishing Zach we&amp;#39;ve caught something to brag about now in all the history of the FBI I&amp;#39;m probably the only one who fished out documents thrown into a waterfall don&amp;#39;t you think so Zach I just don&amp;#39;t believe it files from a waterfall well start believing Emily eternal life eternal power make four human sacrifices on a nights each after eating the seeds [ __ ] we&amp;#39;re almost there three make sure the sacrifice eat the seeds too before they die the sacrifice must also not speak while they are being killed hey whoops what does that all mean they definitely two of them definitely were talking as they died it&amp;#39;s called The Legend of the new rainco killer George have you ever seen this handwriting yes it&amp;#39;s Thomas&amp;#39;s are we just like George out of nowhere be like it&amp;#39;s Thomas he said he&amp;#39;d tell me everything once I take the docks to him but those are classified I can&amp;#39;t allow a civilian to view them especially that deranged Old Goat who owns most of the town I agree with George Harry is how can I put it he might be dead yeah he&amp;#39;s literally the old Rano killer so like yeah you&amp;#39;re right you don&amp;#39;t need to worry you said it yourselves didn&amp;#39;t you there has never been a mass murder case in this town that means these documents pertain to a case that never actually happened just look at it as though they never actually existed either ridiculous York I&amp;#39;m sure you&amp;#39;ve got a plan or something in mind okay you have my approval George are you sure Emily we need to continue looking for Thomas our search may just have become a hunt I think they&amp;#39;re esape go being Thomas I&amp;#39;ll go see Harry alone you think it&amp;#39;s actually Thomas or do you think George is setting up Thomas for the [Music] fall I wouldn&amp;#39;t believe it if I hadn&amp;#39;t seen it for myself but Thomas there&amp;#39;s got to be a rational explanation for this Z Georgia started to change I think the deaths of Becky and Diane had a deep effect on it I guess this town truly is without a king now oh that&amp;#39;s supposed to me what we playing chess okay then Zack let&amp;#39;s pay Harry another visit and get to the bottom of all this I have to admit I do like spending a bit of time investigating loan I&amp;#39;m getting a bit sick of being told that I&amp;#39;m either too slow or too fast you agree with me right Zack I love we had the [ __ ] we had the the little fishing noise just a second why is he always here he&amp;#39;s always here he&amp;#39;s like tailing us and I don&amp;#39;t like that save saving him I&amp;#39;m tired Chad we&amp;#39;ve been like the the OBS closed at a certain point now we already had like 4ish hours on on this on this game before OBS closed and now we&amp;#39;re at 6 hours so we&amp;#39;ve been playing the [ __ ] out of this game uh which is fine I mean obviously I&amp;#39;m really enjoying it if we&amp;#39;re playing it that much oh my God you were breaking up [ __ ] shut up shut up you were having issues quiet I&amp;#39;ll play it over here that was a yeah it&amp;#39;s just I&amp;#39;m I&amp;#39;m just getting I&amp;#39;m just getting tired like I I was obviously this game&amp;#39;s also really really cozy so like uh as a result I&amp;#39;m feeling cozy and I&amp;#39;m just getting like really tired at the same time um yeah",

like to just sit down and write something out you know always write out your feelings it&amp;#39;s very important so I can&amp;#39;t remember what I was doing at the time but all this stuff we used to do when we were kids just came rushing back to me all of a sudden the other day remember when I&amp;#39;d sneak over at night and we would go both go on our adventures ghost hunting we called It we&amp;#39; Shine the flashlight through the trees and jump at every little insignificant noise our imaginations were always working in over dries I wish I could rewind to back then seems like everything after that time just hasn&amp;#39;t really been that good for the both of us how&amp;#39;s okay he scratched s how long has it been again it&amp;#39;s been at least a couple of years

does look really nice they did a really good job I wonder what the new story content is I&amp;#39;m actually very curious cuz I know I know like what the current ending is I was wanting more so badly at the end so I wonder what they mean by that I say if I had a house to SP I don&amp;#39;t know what I would do with all this space like I&amp;#39;m I I very much am just I just don&amp;#39;t need a lot of space as a person a lot of people are like I don&amp;#39;t like sharing my spaces with other people and they and they they get all antsy about that I&amp;#39;m like the opposite I&amp;#39;m like if you give me a desk like this size and and like somewhere to sleep like I will leave the rest of the house alone for you like you the whole like 95% of the house could be all you and as long as I have my my 5% I am so happy that&amp;#39;s probably plot let me not interact that right away right well that&amp;#39;s classroom oh well that&amp;#39;s not good what did I take oh my gosh hello live

there&amp;#39;s an explanation for this stuff the shared traumatic events sounds the most logic to me that night out there in the W is probably what caused it I had I had almost completely block that out but now it&amp;#39;s kind of coming back to me like I said before it&amp;#39;s still really foggy I think the best course of action right now is just ignore it wherever you think you&amp;#39;re seeing this again or seeing things again I&amp;#39;ll try to do the same I&amp;#39;ll probably do the trick C yes she should probably call Lauren sometime I bet some company would help out H there you

boundaries this is so much prettier I know that&amp;#39;s the points the graphical update but like it&amp;#39;s so much prettier than the original I remember the exact area this is beautiful I know there&amp;#39;s a lot of stuff you can [ __ ] around and find in this area too without going into the tunnel right away so I might go around and do that I tried to find my way back to you when I tripped and fell down that slope but my flashlight hit one of the Rocks down there and broke and it was Pitch Black I heard sounds all around me screaming sounded just like you I tried to follow it but I was lost and I fell everything collapsed down around me could feel it crushing me everything was moving so fast I was drowning in water I couldn&amp;#39;t see every fear I&amp;#39;ve ever had came back to me all at once monsters shouted me my stomach inverted my eyes shrilled out of existence and my heart caved in I don&amp;#39;t know what happened after that I woke up in some tall grass today and found my way back to the house I looked through the window and saw you sitting on the couch staring at your TV I couldn&amp;#39;t get your attention at all so I left I can&amp;#39;t ride anymore I can&amp;#39;t think straight I need to and then that&amp;#39;s where it cuts off attention all employees after the closing of the Sunday your paychecks will be mailed to your home address

saw him today he really wants you to come in sometime and just talk with him and I think it&amp;#39;s a good idea he also said that confronting this traumatic event in some way would be very beneficial too don&amp;#39;t worry I didn&amp;#39;t tell any of the specifics about what happened I don&amp;#39;t think we should go back to that park behind your mom&amp;#39;s house sometime soon though I think being out there and seeing nothing W get rid of these stupid problems that we&amp;#39;ve both been having it&amp;#39;s not my fault he just randomly came that&amp;#39;s also a good win they want me badly then they should uh make a move then if they want me bad way I&amp;#39;ve done my fair share of reaching out you want it come get it it&amp;#39;s spray too is all as dirt that&amp;#39;s just rude no that doesn&amp;#39;t turn me off in reference to murder the Vega classic oh I do have my flashlight still old and married what else you&amp;#39;re going to retire soon what&amp;#39;s next on the agenda old man I may be think of a different area but I thought there was like more out here or maybe that shed was the thing I was thinking of yeah I could have swort there

not a parent maybe someday going be the right woman but I&amp;#39;m not currently I do not have any kids that I know but what about my trains mom we&amp;#39;re new alone I understand that this may shock you but I&amp;#39;m I&amp;#39;m not a particularly a fan of crowds so I understand that don&amp;#39;t aware where there&amp;#39;s a lot of people on my a not the biggest fan this is eerie Charlie run away they got lured away oh look at the oh look at that it&amp;#39;s so cool spooky as reports of missing surveyors and Prospectors rapidly escalated in the spring of 1901 police mandated the intended roots of travel must be given to police prior to departure yeah that&amp;#39;s what I wanted to make sure I got before we advanced cuz I knew that was up here or remembered rather

could just totally miss it right like it&amp;#39;s just like not even remotely required but I don&amp;#39;t know I just NE when games add little stuff like that that&amp;#39;s like hey if you really care and you really explore um yeah this is the be area we&amp;#39;ll reward you you know thank you for being invested and interested in our game you know like that sort of thing I think that&amp;#39;s one of the things that makes Resident Evil games like actually like super um amazing is like they&amp;#39;re both horror games and exploration games like they&amp;#39;re adventure games too hey Eli how&amp;#39;s it going no you have me all right can make this game this is the uh graphical overhaul SL story update that&amp;#39;s coming out this Wednesday so yes the wild Studios was

old plot of land that belonged to the mat family a ways back Charles was known to take his wife Diane and his son Charlie to the old homestad for family picnics I never imagined what I would see there

Revolution I mean it&amp;#39;s one of those things were like um the American Revolution was a good first step into like the rights of man and people but the French Revolution was kind of like more important way more important cuz despite the fact that France didn&amp;#39;t stabilize for like decades and decades and decades after the fact the the treaties of Rights of Man was like super B which America did not sign tells you a lot about us now done it America said the rights of man [ __ ] that you treat people like [ __ ] okay there we go yeah essentially France for for a good while there

confident I was like who is it and just hey hi bud hi you going to help me okay well don&amp;#39;t touch you understood right Charlie&amp;#39;s a good boy now hold on I see something over here he this is pretty exciting isn&amp;#39;t it this whole mystery the missing boy the sightings the arson I&amp;#39;m glad I get to share this adventure with you I can&amp;#39;t help but feel sadden for Mr mat he&amp;#39;s lost so much I wish he would have let me in and help him the way you&amp;#39;re helping me maybe I could have saved him since I couldn&amp;#39;t help him in life maybe I can help him now I promised to find out what happened to his son perhaps I will put his soul at peace thanks again Kate I look forward to our adventures that was I was supposed to read why is my flashlight still bad I can&amp;#39;t see but what am I what do you want me to do what are you looking at this guy keeps stopping by my house and asking about my son I keep telling him to go away he&amp;#39;s getting more and more desperate I still see him I keep looking for him it can&amp;#39;t be him though I know it can&amp;#39;t it&amp;#39;s so real everywhere I go I hear his voice but it sounds like he&amp;#39;s suffering like it&amp;#39;s not the son I knew I can&amp;#39;t escape this torment this man this thing it taunts me eats of my mind am I doing this to myself was it my fault that Charlie disappeared is this my trial or is it My Punishment I just need to end it and Cleanse This Place all right yep there it is not the bands no we had nice shoes well now you know what happen to gate he like after all that you&amp;#39;re dead hey the cycle continues it doesn&amp;#39;t end with us as a matter of fact as a matter of fact it doesn&amp;#39;t end with us it continues which is very sad that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s what I so that was like my thing or is just very very amazing very very good game and I uh I always wanted more I always want more and I think that&amp;#39;s a good that&amp;#39;s a good sign of something is something that leaves you wanting more so hey we just did this big update it was very very cool very very awesome so maybe it&amp;#39;ll you know hopefully fingers crossed fingers crossed it bleeds into something else and becomes something vers something cool and fun this will generate a lot of hudo around the game again I think one the thing I think they I think it&amp;#39;s really cool because it is a really short game but it really does capture like the essence of Slender like uh like the just like the eeriness of being taken away and like I was talking to earlier but slender doesn&amp;#39;t Slenderman doesn&amp;#39;t kill you you disappear he turns you into something else like there&amp;#39;s an air of mystery to like what he does and how he operates and I think the game really captures it perfectly take eat that door locks yeah we&amp;#39;ll have to see on Wednesday we have to see on Wednesday uh how that door uh what happens with that door very very intrigued uh Wednesday is our indie horror night so maybe we can I don&amp;#39;t know we have to play all the way up until the second well actually there&amp;#39;s chapter selection isn&amp;#39;t there we&amp;#39;d have to go to that chapter maybe we&amp;#39;ll start off anywh I checking what&amp;#39;s in there maybe is Wednesday that is this Wednesday TR gra you hav&amp;#39;t yeah cuz there&amp;#39;s chapter selection we could yeah we could thetically start Wednesday by going in and uh yeah by going in and uh oh that was on easy maybe that&amp;#39;s why things were maybe that&amp;#39;s why we&amp;#39;re just blowing through things that&amp;#39;s why that section with the what with the [ __ ] that&amp;#39;s why that section with the Whatchamacallit um with the the proxy with Kate was super easy I remember getting stuck on that but we were on easy apparently okay that makes sense I wonder why that defaults easy usually gamees default to normal yeah usually game&amp;#39;s default to normal that&amp;#39;s interesting hardore be fun trust I I don&amp;#39;t know about that I don&amp;#39;t know about that yeah I I I don&amp;#39;t know like I&amp;#39;ve said with like Resident Evil games and stuff like that before I really enjoy watching people do challenge runs but I don&amp;#39;t like I don&amp;#39;t enjoy uh doing them like I don&amp;#39;t know I find horror games to be so like cozy and they&amp;#39;re a cozy thing for me do hardcore why just so I can die right away like I mean you guys understand that like you guys are like we&amp;#39;ll hop in and do hardcore just for the means but but like the real threat probably doesn&amp;#39;t come into like way later you know what I&amp;#39;m saying like there there&amp;#39;s probably just like a guided section where I literally can&amp;#39;t be killed as it&amp;#39;s like introducing plot and story and stuff so like it probably wouldn&amp;#39;t be relevant you know probably wouldn&amp;#39;t be relevant uh for like a long time so like it&amp;#39;s not I don&amp;#39;t feel like it&amp;#39;s something I could just necessarily like hop in and just be like oh okay I&amp;#39;m just going to mess around a little bit te and then um be done with it right um so yeah um yeah but like in terms of uh in terms of the game itself in terms of the game itself very very wonderful it always has been always has been it was it was a wonderful fun game when you guys recommended it for the horror Let&amp;#39;s Plays like a long time ago like it was really really good then and it&amp;#39;s really really good now and now it looks better it looks way way better like like I was literally gobs I was like Gob smacked when I when I went out and we saw like that that that Skybox with like the uh radio tower in the distance um like that was actually it looked really really good like the graphical update is sick and really really awesome so yeah like I said there if you guys want to play this yourself obviously that door will be open too that it is on Wednesday when this releases for everybody else once again I know I was kind of getting annoying about it at a certain point um thank you BL Studios for reaching out to me and letting me uh try this and and try this early was very very fun very very good uh huge fan of the game uh and I was happy to get to play it again um so yeah like I said hopefully you guys like really think about like doing something else and doing something new because like I don&amp;#39;t know this is a wonderful update and I want to see more from you want to see more from you so yeah I I really appreciate it so yeah I don&amp;#39;t know else to say um yeah it&amp;#39;s really really wonderful and I just had a good time so I don&amp;#39;t know don&amp;#39;t need to talk in circles here you know just let it be let it be let it be but uh yeah um other than that I feel like that&amp;#39;s going to be it for me guys um we did have a a a metric butt ton of uh of match reviews today um play a little bit of deeps before that so we&amp;#39;ve had a lot and then we just played a full game I know it&amp;#39;s kind of a short game but we just

can&amp;#39;t he&amp;#39;s just standing there menacingly is he I decided to move here cuz the rent is very cheap mood I honestly can&amp;#39;t believe that a broke student like me can afford such a nice room plus it&amp;#39;s really close to my school how amazing is that I ate out with my parents today to celebrate the move and they were both laughing and just having such a great time living alone is great and all but man I&amp;#39;m going to miss those faces they told me that they&amp;#39;re going to only be here for a couple days kept telling me how worried they are but I think they&amp;#39;re just overthinking they don&amp;#39;t have to worry about a thing I&amp;#39;m going to do just fine okay so we got to get seven of these that&amp;#39;s the fasma noise which is probably just a stock noise but it&amp;#39;s funny realistically that paper would be okay about to say that that paper would be ruined it doesn&amp;#39;t matter if I dry it uh the paper would be ruined the hair dryer this game is weird so far I&amp;#39;ll say that this game is very weird so far what what in the I&amp;#39;m I&amp;#39;m pretty sure that would not work that way but you know it&amp;#39;d be completely legible afterwards April 5th today I took a whole day just sitting everything up in the room what used to be a room with small luggage and a simple bed now has become a room with a bunch of furniture and a whopping queensized bed the previous tenant left everything the owner was too lazy to get rid of him dad seemed to like that like this house so badly he said he&amp;#39;d like to stay a little longer but as much as I appreciate their company I&amp;#39;d like to live life already my owner came to say hello today he looked like he could use a little sleep though what was wrong with him he shook my hand with a big smile on his face and told him how grateful he was for somebody to finally rent the room that&amp;#39;s a bad sign but I always stopped smiling when you let my hand go that was way too weird anyways new semester starts tomorrow got to get ready so it&amp;#39;s a it&amp;#39;s a it&amp;#39;s probably a cursed oh oh I bet something&amp;#39;s going to go up with the shenans with the mirror here so it&amp;#39;s a cursed apartment or something I bet okay so we know one&amp;#39;s outside there&amp;#39;s probably a bunch outside so we should probably um going to take a little sweep of the apartment real quick oh now you can look through the hole cuz the paper&amp;#39;s not there anymore oh I don&amp;#39;t like this oh I don&amp;#39;t like this oh my God it&amp;#39;s just like Silent Hill 4 there you go sorry I had to say it cuz somebody else is going to be like oh my God you&amp;#39;re looking through people that&amp;#39;s just like hit underrated horror video gam Silent Hill 4 one of the best horror games of all time oh that sound was just immediate it didn&amp;#39;t even fade in I wonder if there&amp;#39;s a paper and like what the what the who are you where where did you get here was it though yeah I think it&amp;#39;s overrated can I not interact with you give G I need that g Gib okay all right be that way so I need money for the thing when did you get here what wait there&amp;#39;s a little there&amp;#39;s a prompt no is that not a prompt no that&amp;#39;s just the light is that plant always been there a bunch of things just appeared outside lur I appreciate that red thank you for hanging out even if it is in the lur Zone I wonder if there&amp;#39;s a paper back where we came from because a bunch of stuff just spawned literally or you got scared either way I&amp;#39;m sorry s for demo gameplay when I&amp;#39;m probably going to play it uh like uh tomorrow I don&amp;#39;t know if I&amp;#39;ll stream it but I I did down it is downloaded and on my computer yeah I wonder if it&amp;#39;s like new headphones so I can hear any voices and the wire was just a bit loose and they work fine oh thank God that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s a lot of M spent on something for it did not work work remember anything me I mean it&amp;#39;s like it&amp;#39;s an okay game it&amp;#39;s just like people treating it like it&amp;#39;s the best uh I never I never prayed that well I guess it&amp;#39;s going we came back either way um feels slightly warmer is it just my imagination here at the wall so I need a way to get through this wall somehow this game&amp;#39;s odd you can tell it&amp;#39;s one of the earlier games cuz it&amp;#39;s just weird cuz like that&amp;#39;s like one of the things you have to do with like indie games like you got to make them really interesting cuz you know they don&amp;#39;t really have like their graphics and um polish so you got to do weird things uh I mean like it it might be like a garage T cuz it looks kind of like you know can&amp;#39;t go to this machine I could be totally off base I we don&amp;#39;t need to feel like anything for the papers isn&amp;#39;t this way yeah this is where we spawned I just wanted to check you never know with these indie games and the crazy things that they do I am not going back into the dark alley not getting lost I me to restart again what is that the light I don&amp;#39;t why it looks like that kind of hurt my eyes to stare at to be honest oh I get it it&amp;#39;s a oh oh I&amp;#39;m sorry oh I&amp;#39;m sorry oh okay yall saw that right what was that I get it because it&amp;#39;s a it&amp;#39;s a it&amp;#39;s a carrying bird so it wants it wants food which is unfortunately the dead cat yeah I don&amp;#39;t know how it carried that thing St EV is an achievement I still need money just need that 100 Y for the I don&amp;#39;t like how there&amp;#39;s that footstep sound occasionally makes me nervous I like how we don&amp;#39;t ever close our friends door either April 6th today was the first day of the semester it&amp;#39;s good to see my boys again they wanted to come see my new apartment but I don&amp;#39;t know they just better not [ __ ] anything up mashima Sensei is my home room teacher I wonder what kind of teacher she is I mean she&amp;#39;s not like the previous one that guy was an [ __ ] another weird thing happened today though when I got out of the room this morning to make some middle-age or when I got out of the room this morning some middle-aged ladies across the street gathered and talked about talked badly about this apartment women of that age gossip a lot but it&amp;#39;s probably whatever it&amp;#39;s probably not we&amp;#39;re probably getting probably getting low rck cuz somebody was like murdered here or something and the apartment&amp;#39;s haunted oh you can shut this I&amp;#39;m just I&amp;#39;m just it&amp;#39;s just me being a jerk that&amp;#39;s all I still

locked so now I can get in there ah okay why did I you see me become squib all right April 8th mom came over to my room again told her she doesn&amp;#39;t have to come anymore I told her or I think she had a fight with uh dad again her passive aggressive attitude got to me so I asked her how dad is doing she refused to talk about it instead just sat there quietly I&amp;#39;ve never seen her like this before she would usually just put on a fake smile and put a smake smake put a fake smile on her face after a fight I would notice that wasn&amp;#39;t just like that this time an hour or so later she regained her usual positivity and she asked me if I could invite my old time friend sayaka which is probably us he had the biggest smile when I agreed to it my mom must be worried for me living alone still I only have Mir Chan on my mind right now though oh my god brother get over yourself she does she&amp;#39;s not a to you man she&amp;#39;s not into to you do matter if you want if you&amp;#39;re into her doesn&amp;#39;t matter let it go brother that smile her eyes Wen smiling your eyes can&amp;#39;t smile though all right now I can get that paper from the other place now that my hand is emptied there&amp;#39;s no inventory system all right I still need 30 more uh yen to be able to get that other page too I almost missed the door April 9th I was able to talk to Mir Chan today what a great day oh no except for one thing mom was gone when I woke up this morning her car was still parked here and it&amp;#39;s odd for her to leave without notice I hope dad picked her up or something cuz the car is still there invited sayaka today and she said she would come tomorrow I hope this makes her happy again oh am I a sad boy or sad woman sad girl sad day sad z s it hey no no no no no open that open that open that open up the safe got a lock the tap all right where do I go now I need 30 more yen to access the vending machine I haven&amp;#39;t seen any more money where do we go go now where do we go now anything else than this no I hate that I hear people walking sometimes probably just ambient noise just to freak me out but it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s working I&amp;#39;m like what is that where&amp;#39;s that coming from I think what&amp;#39;s happening is I keep checking the doors cuz there is another there&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s two games that they have based on apartments and this is the other one oh what is this this definitely wasn&amp;#39;t here hey this wasn&amp;#39;t here before what where did this come from what somebody&amp;#39;s always following you I mean they could at least talk to me or something say hi wave you know 20 in yeah I&amp;#39;m going to check back the other way cuz that definitely wasn&amp;#39;t there before and that spawned so maybe something spawn this way that poor kitat [Music] they are shy no they&amp;#39;re not shy they&amp;#39;re going to kill me okay thanks for the money remember we walked by earlier we just like nope I knew it was going like jump at me or something see like there something was walking stop it put it did I get this Shrine I did what did the shrines even do cuz I&amp;#39;ve been running into them but they haven&amp;#39;t necessarily been doing a whole lot for me okay I can&amp;#39;t go there okay okay we got that one there money my I need I need 10 more again I need 10 more 10 more come on come on come on come on come on come on come on come on just need 10 more man Gib give money okay we get it there&amp;#39;s a bunch of shrines everywhere in this weird garage door looking thing that I got warm at I tinkled in my pants when I went over there oh God the walking stop it there&amp;#39;s just another vending machine here here that does nothing and this is where I spawned I hope it&amp;#39;s not back in that dark crevice and I actually have to go back there that would be the worst that would be the bad ending it had to be okay well I maybe triggering that triggered something else cuz things just do be appearing uh out of nowhere here so maybe triggering the ghost lady with the umbrella figured something somewhere else maybe why are the inside of these walls so creepy looking too yep there&amp;#39;s definitely just footstep noises in the ambience that&amp;#39;s cool is it in the Frog pot frog pot frog pot is it in the Frog pot no sh do you hear that that there&amp;#39;s like creepy ghost noises coming from this room oh that&amp;#39;s right cuz this is the other side of that that place okay it&amp;#39;s probably part of that interesting that this door gives us a lock noise like we&amp;#39;re not allowed in there I could check the this room again but hey quit okay okay we can&amp;#39;t open any of the new doors [Music] so okay all obnoxious desk related things aside I can&amp;#39;t believe that&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s been only 9 months it feels so much longer it does thank you for creating such a wonderful Community safe space and allowing me into your digital friend Circle it truly means a lot to have a place where someone cares and vice versa here&amp;#39;s to many more online and offline Adventures who Vice Vera I am getting emotional over here impact when I out of all people get emotional over something like this yeah cry you won&amp;#39;t do it hey I just had to wait for this the wall de blade for no reason so I could get money yeah put that in the walkth through but thank you D I really do appreciate that thank you I was I was talking talking with somebody like outside of my like my internet Circle and they were asking about the stream thing and they&amp;#39;re like why do you why do you enjoy streaming because it doesn&amp;#39;t seem very like fruitful or fulfilling I&amp;#39;m like some people are like man I watch your YouTube to get me through uh lunch break on work every day or or stuff like what you said where it&amp;#39;s like hey I actually feel welcome here and I feel cared for it&amp;#39;s a little things right little things you can&amp;#39;t put like any sort of like physical tag on you know that&amp;#39;s why that&amp;#39;s why I stick with it it&amp;#39;s like that stuff right there oh I thought there was going to be an animation or something sorry yeah that stuff that&amp;#39;s why I do it why is that wall bleeding digma why are you okay Dion did you need to stop by a different website before you got here today There Is No Escape and I cannot read the rest oh okay denied the cons subscribe y thanks I appreciate that it&amp;#39;s Risky Business denying the cons so you are brave need to get home okay I&amp;#39;m just too used to doing it with Wes you know that&amp;#39;s fine I looked back repeatedly as I felt I was constantly being watched but no matter how many times I looked no one was there I couldn&amp;#39;t handle the fear I walked as fast as I could he was absent from school the next day his seat was occupied by someone else I tried asking a friends and teachers but none of them knew or even heard of his name after school I went to the same apartment however the apartment was sold Accord to the locals the place i&amp;#39; been on sale for a while where did the apartment go the boy I knew and loved we were in love with him oh I don&amp;#39;t remember his name either who am I even talking [Music] about end results saved oh there&amp;#39;s different endings oh oh oh what how did I get was that the good ending or the bad ending what this game it&amp;#39;s a game about a haunted apartment wait how did I wait stigmatized property those are I forgot I have three monitors again so I can just throw this over here you got the seven pages I did does the Conch like you yeah hey pun likes you Tada yeah which ending did I just get yeah there is multiple endings see oh so the shrines are how you get the good ending so because I thought the shrines were part part of the plot no the shrines are optional that&amp;#39;s how you get different endings okay so let&amp;#39;s just uh let&amp;#39;s just ignore the shrines this time oh there is Sprint in this game I just couldn&amp;#39;t tell cuz it&amp;#39;s so slow let&amp;#39;s get the other ending the cool thing about uh chart games well poor thing I agree about chill Arts games is that they are um they&amp;#39;re usually like a length so like you you it&amp;#39;s typically not like arduous at all to go back and get the um the other endings we saw that with their most recent [Music] game okay from Des to Dex Dexter hexter Dex xit the hex Dex I like how you&amp;#39;re very like I don&amp;#39;t you never Strike me as somebody who&amp;#39;s very like self-conscious about themselves and if if you are you&amp;#39;re very good at hiding it you&amp;#39;re very like this is how I am and that&amp;#39;s okay and that&amp;#39;s a good that&amp;#39;s a good skill to have oh God she&amp;#39;s talking over herself the plant wasn&amp;#39;t there yeah so why does that plant appear but it has nothing to do with anything yeah that that plant is not at all part maybe it was maybe that&amp;#39;s like a leftover thing right maybe at one point that was part of maybe at one point that was part of something they planned that you could do was like maybe do something with the plant and they just never ended up using it in the final version of the game you know cuz you&amp;#39;re right the plant wasn&amp;#39;t there and the plant disappear and we never use it for anything wait can we give the fish to the crow as well what that never happened the first time what in the hell is that that would that didn&amp;#39;t happen the first time that was kind of scary are you cool with having this fish or you can give it the fish or the thing that&amp;#39;s interesting got an achievement

groups are very like personal not deeply personal but like you&amp;#39;re going to be spending a lot of time with those people for a long time so you know it&amp;#39;s kind of good to be like picky about that all right so I guess that&amp;#39;s I guess we beat Sigma property all endings and then literally an hour I don&amp;#39;t know if the game&amp;#39;s like that short or if I&amp;#39;m just like used to their games at this point eat their game literally in an hour um it&amp;#39;s one of their earlier games and you can kind of tell yeah you can kind of tell um but like you can see where they like evolved from this uh you know they evolve from this to uh their uh their uh you know more uh robust um than were robust games and I think it&amp;#39;s I still still cool it was still a cool concept of like a haunted apartment that like um whoever you know you know stays here you know gets uh possessed or taken by the complex itself and that sort of thing it&amp;#39;s a pretty straightforward plot but it&amp;#39;s you know it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s creepy enough right creepy enough you know it was it was all right it was it was good yeah grab water y thanks thanks appreciate it I totally missed my mouth and I&amp;#39;m just going to pretend I didn&amp;#39;t yep all right let me we play you know it&amp;#39;s funny the run up was uh play more Suns of the forest

chop chop you look like an ogre grab all the equipment in the van and get it in there we&amp;#39;re going to set up think about it but now I&amp;#39;m curious dude it was so good it was such a good time cuz it starts off as like the usual like puppet combo kind of like weird plot bogus you know but it like very very quickly became like kind of like a Resident Evil game and it was so [Music] awesome this music&amp;#39;s cozy too that&amp;#39;s a pretty [Music] house good check it out it&amp;#39;s worth it it&amp;#39;s definitely worth it I wish I could steam share it but it&amp;#39;s like not on Steam [Music] okay got to go get the other [Music] one yeah I think he would like it a [Music] lot there was a certain part where there was like like like 20 enemies in the room and and I literally did the thing that I that like no damage run uh like speedrunners of res evil D where they just shoot them just so they get stunned and you can run by and I&amp;#39;m like this is my kind of game okay I just set up but there&amp;#39;s no power in this house better tell somebody wow this is a cool house that&amp;#39;s really what I just said I hate every second of this I hate every second

seriously that actually sounds really cool okay yeah like I like how it&amp;#39;s a little bit more like a little bit less frustrating than it is to like Crouch search like uh something in their previous games but also it&amp;#39;s like really time consuming so I don&amp;#39;t know I don&amp;#39;t I feel about it yet have you played n Massacre yes I played it last week actually and it was amazing and it&amp;#39;s one of my favorite games like like not even just like like indie games like one of my favorite game games I got four endings last week and a off stream I played it and got the fifth ending so yeah I love n Massacre n Massacre I was like really addicted to that game like we like we played the other games for like like 1 hour each I played n Massac for like 3 hours just cuz it was so fun okay we had the fuse and I&amp;#39;m assuming the fuse box in the basement same people who it was I thought you said same people some people that worked on Bioshock interesting I&amp;#39;m assum okay I thought everybody was gone I was like what hey Tom do you know how to turn the power on the power hm I don&amp;#39;t know anything about that maybe look for a fuse box yeah I I could have figured that out Tom thanks I hate every second of get the power on we don&amp;#39;t have all day shut up God and make me liad yeah it was it was a super fun game and it&amp;#39;s also like it&amp;#39;s also one of those games where it&amp;#39;s like um like because all the spawns are static like you can really get a good like rhythm with it you know so like if you want to go for multiple endings like I wish I had a flashlight or something like if you get a good rhythm with it like you can really like go searching for all those different endings and I really really like that a lot okay I can&amp;#39;t see a single thing over here oh my God we have all night h ha ha I feel like the fuse box is like somewhere in this like oh no it&amp;#39;s right here I&amp;#39;m an idiot

the scary part so we kind of can&amp;#39;t [ __ ] up no matter what we do [Music] hard mode yeah essentially it&amp;#39;s Kiki&amp;#39;s Delivery Service okay I wish there&amp;#39;s like a medkit or something fact that there&amp;#39;s not kind of sucks I have no idea I really I have no idea where to go now [Music] okay check all the rooms upstairs I did I guess I haven&amp;#39;t technically been back to the attic since I came down here so we&amp;#39;re going to do that too fast to sleep now I can&amp;#39;t go back up wish I had uh thought of that when I was right next to the attic now I got to sneak all the way back upstairs without him finding me only reason I&amp;#39;m hurt is because I had a hallucination that locked all the doors it&amp;#39;s kind of bogus you need a medic bag well I don&amp;#39;t even think there&amp;#39;s I am my on time we played glass staircase and now we&amp;#39;re about halfway through uh a murder house but hope you&amp;#39;re having a good day Rami tried not hallucinating man if only it was that easy okay okay yeah um yeah I have no idea what to do like at all this sucks dude so we can go straight down but we can&amp;#39;t uh go up yeah this is uh I have no idea what to do could he be in there I looked in there he wasn&amp;#39;t in there anymore I looked in there and he was just not no longer there totally not see what I miss while everybody&amp;#39;s dead holy [ __ ] you scared the [ __ ] out of me oh my God holy [ __ ] it&amp;#39;s funny cuz I came in here before and he wasn&amp;#39;t there and now he&amp;#39;s I guess I had to like come in come out like once then come back cuz it came in once before and his body was just gone car was left on first t lock the exit you bastard she says how do I know that there&amp;#39;s all four I&amp;#39;m going to save I know it&amp;#39;s my last one but like I&amp;#39;m not doing all this again [Music] okay not doing all this again nope nope like 30 minutes I&amp;#39;m sorry I don&amp;#39;t know well the poker didn&amp;#39;t seem to do do anything it&amp;#39;s locked okay so he didn&amp;#39;t unlock anything is there something else I&amp;#39;m supposed to find she [Music] asked well I don&amp;#39;t know Pokemon enough he&amp;#39;ll leave you alone I didn&amp;#39;t think about that can not open maybe I don&amp;#39;t know like you&amp;#39;re wanting me to go through this entire place with a killer on the loose and search every single [ __ ] cabinet now oh my god oh oh well that&amp;#39;s where we need to go oh oh brother oh brother oh remember we have to uh we have to eat account with him remember it was in the uh in the news thing [Applause] right yep you son of a [ __ ] it was you all along that&amp;#39;s right it was quiet innocent Tom harmless walk all over him Tom mama&amp;#39;s boy Tom well I did I killed them all but why to avenge my brother Anthony wasn&amp;#39;t the Easter Ripper I was he turned himself to save me how&amp;#39;s your day bud I thought I could control the Earth to kill but it&amp;#39;s back no I&amp;#39;m going to kill you uh [Music] holy [ __ ] oh [ __ ] that does not bother him he&amp;#39;s [ __ ] M Myers he&amp;#39;s like I take that shot that&amp;#39;s fine oh [ __ ] Tom&amp;#39;s the tank he is Thomas the Tank Engine I get [Music] it oh I thought I had more you poken did nothing yeah cuz this is what a shotgun is doing [Music] wait it has no bullets what do I do wait what do I do it says it wait wait wait what do I do did I miss something is there a way to reload what is there more bullets what I&amp;#39;m so [ __ ] confused actually oh [ __ ] he&amp;#39;s right there I don&amp;#39;t know what to do like at all poke him then run I guess that&amp;#39;s not going to work out too well though oh [ __ ] he&amp;#39;s like right there right there those boxes I don&amp;#39;t think so no no prompt so there&amp;#39;s no prompt I feel like they wouldn&amp;#39;t have me like fight him poke him I guess that&amp;#39;s what I have to do just doesn&amp;#39;t seem smart okay oh God damn it that&amp;#39;s why I didn&amp;#39;t want to [ __ ] do that [Music] g he&amp;#39;s not special at all he&amp;#39;s just a dude so I don&amp;#39;t know why four shotgun shots to the [ __ ] face doesn&amp;#39;t [ __ ] kill him [ __ ] stupid dude if only I wasn&amp;#39;t at one hit from Death the entire [ __ ] game because of a hallucination that locked all the [ __ ] doors and got him to Corner me for essentially free stupid man and there&amp;#39;s no way to heal either so you&amp;#39;re just kind of like [ __ ] hosed cuz he says so no we still have to go get the egg from upstairs don&amp;#39;t we do yeah forever hard mod I know like how there&amp;#39;s just no way to get out of this situation now like if you [ __ ] up at any point like you just got to like get [ __ ] [ __ ] on which is just [ __ ] stupid in my opinion you can just never recover ever you just always have to deal with this now wait no I saved after I got the egg another one like another gun where would that be though cuz like I&amp;#39;ve been all over this house like 18 times yeah so we already did that part after you poked him yeah but I&amp;#39;m one hit from Death so I essentially can&amp;#39;t play the [ __ ] game because of a hallucination that happened way earlier in the game because I [ __ ] up earlier in the game I&amp;#39;m not allowed to play the game at the end because there&amp;#39;s no way to heal yourself which kind of sucks unless I wanted to like literally restart from a point I was healthy and like perfect that spot and not get hit like I&amp;#39;d be fine it&amp;#39;s the fact that I got hit earlier in the in the game and there&amp;#39;s no way to heal so yeah like I&amp;#39;m literally one hit from death and there&amp;#39;s no way to fix it cuz there&amp;#39;s no medkits or anything you thanks I&amp;#39;m going to grab the the gun first if it&amp;#39;ll let me [Music] not sure though I don&amp;#39;t know okay see like these don&amp;#39;t have any sort of interaction to them [Music] either no I didn&amp;#39;t want to trigger you [Music] oh would help that he&amp;#39;s like [ __ ] on my ass the entire [ __ ] time oh [Music] [ __ ] broken time yeah and then miss once and get [ __ ] killed time is what it is [Music] yeah get [ __ ] B to the pistol there&amp;#39;s a pistol in this game yeah where was it where was the pistol I searched over every into this [ __ ] house how did I not find the pistol sure there should have been few weapons you found I found the poker I didn&amp;#39;t find anything else and I&amp;#39;ve been around like everywhere in this house you can&amp;#39;t can&amp;#39;t kill me I&amp;#39;m the Easter Ripper oh my God open on the drawer I did and that gave me the magnet you can&amp;#39;t do this it gave me a magnet the letter opener gave me the magnet it didn&amp;#39;t give me the [Applause] gun oh my God holy [ __ ] oh okay there&amp;#39;s also a medkit I I&amp;#39;m Lally looking this up cuz like I literally found none of this like anywhere like I searched every single drawer but I never found any of this like I literally searched every single drawer and I never found any of this there&amp;#39;s two drawers you can open where was the other one I literally never found it see EG hun there&amp;#39;s a few Med kits I literally never even found one like ever like not one in the entire house I think it was in the kitchen where was it in the kitchen guess you did hard mode I guess so hold on hold on hold [Music] on Cut brilliant What congratulations guys that&amp;#39;s a wrap is a cabinet the first day kid I checked all of the cabinets in the kitchen all of the cabinets in the kitchen a WP that ending doesn&amp;#39;t make any sense well it&amp;#39;s a WAP anyways because our house rental ends tomorrow what what clapping The Clapper is my job all day clap clap clap it&amp;#39;s enough to drive you crazy what the [ __ ] can I put the mic down now I would hate to have to edit this piece of [ __ ] what do you think I think it&amp;#39;s stupid hey how would I know Nick would skip town two days before we wrapped up the shoot but Tom he&amp;#39;s not even tall enough to be the killer don&amp;#39;t worry about it no one&amp;#39;s going to notice what the [ __ ] dude what&amp;#39;s wrong with you too many pizzas how many did you eat three damn slices no pizza I was bored not much left to do since I died well good news then it&amp;#39;s over oh thank God he&amp;#39;s the people someone could give me a ride into town off this house you know people really got killed in this house that&amp;#39;s just a rumor okay what the [ __ ] this is so strange three pizzas we&amp;#39;ve all been there oh I can go back into the house oh [ __ ] oh look at all the pizzas any more pizza n your buddy Dan finished it up I&amp;#39;m starving there&amp;#39;s plenty of jela and salad yeah I&amp;#39;ll think about that it&amp;#39;s not that bad okay what is happening hello I don&amp;#39;t even have my [ __ ] flashlight anymore what is going on oh look there&amp;#39;s the [Music] suit we what happened to Nick huh who the guy who played the Easter Ripper oh that guy he was a weirdo he didn&amp;#39;t say anything to me the whole shoot what the [ __ ] this is neat it&amp;#39;s definitely weird it&amp;#39;s out there okay [Music] [Music] okay this is very meta I don&amp;#39;t know how I feel about it [Music] yet check kitchen for what I was just in the [Music] kitchen for Med kit maybe it&amp;#39;s there that&amp;#39;s what I was going to do after this I was literally going to load up a save cuz I checked it I think I checked it this prop is so annoying I think I think what happened is I checked it technically before the Easter Ripper spawned so so the cabinets are empty before he spawns and then they just spawn [ __ ] into them so that&amp;#39;s probably what happened so all the places I checked and I said oh well there&amp;#39;s nothing in there like they it just filled with [ __ ] later on so [ __ ] magically appeared because man I thought hey I already checked that in in AAR situation of life and death I wouldn&amp;#39;t who my skeletons the [ __ ] yeah real good why are there two of me thank you it took me so long to POS them yeah why would why would I in a life or death situation being hunted by that thing check a kitchen cabinet that for formerly had nothing in it why would I assume [ __ ] would [Music] spawn stunt double there you go that&amp;#39;s EAS you&amp;#39;re doing oh those are my car keys now I can go home yay play on a hard mod easy hey we did get it done we literally fire we did some dark ssy [ __ ] with the fire poker and still got him down no G re quiet poker Oly challenge I&amp;#39;m sure somebody&amp;#39;s done [Music] that let&amp;#39;s party and then clean up and then clean up we&amp;#39;re finally free worst shoot ever what the [ __ ] is going on I like turtles I like turtles you like my makeup let&amp;#39;s party and then clean up all that hard work finally paid off this is ridiculous oh you can go in here what are you doing rehearsing for my next role what&amp;#39;s that bikini babes on werewolf Planet I play Queen Zion exciting want to help with the part sure Queen zon we caught the bikini babes sneaking into the palace well what do you have to say for yourselves we didn&amp;#39;t mean to we don&amp;#39;t even know how we got onto this planet silence you think I&amp;#39;m a fool take their bikinis bikini babes you&amp;#39;ll have to settle for just babes what w what do you think you were great you were great what the [ __ ] okay that&amp;#39;s a thing which one is mine is it this one which car is mine how he bleach how&amp;#39;s it going how are you friendo [Music] [Music] I you can see him in the background in the back left he just wanted to ride home yeah okay this is what we&amp;#39;re going to do we&amp;#39;re going to go to this this like mid saave and we&amp;#39;re going to go to the kitchen we&amp;#39;re going to check that because I I guarantee what just happened was that it just it just spawned a bunch of items in places I had already checked like after like after the fact that I had checked everything but I just didn&amp;#39;t check it before [ __ ] hit the fan officially good night friends good night CLP I appreciate you so it like technically like you know technically didn&amp;#39;t count no not the hiding place excuse me [Music] no Med kit no medkit the room with the lamps the room with the lamps room with the lamps [Music] use a letter opener okay so I do oh my God okay okay so you&amp;#39;re able to actually exit that menu you&amp;#39;re actually able to exit that menu and then use a letter opener cuz I thought like hey once I&amp;#39;m in this menu I can&amp;#39;t open my inventory right I&amp;#39;m pressing Z right now and I can&amp;#39;t open it like I&amp;#39;m mashing Z does nothing so I was like oh okay so it&amp;#39;s just locked forever I guess cuz so many games have like the illusion of content where it&amp;#39;s like oh that door&amp;#39;s just locked and you&amp;#39;ll or that door&amp;#39;s jammed you&amp;#39;ll never go over there you know what I&amp;#39;m saying so I just assumed it was another one of those like illusions of content where it was just like oh you just can&amp;#39;t go there so yeah uh uh room with the lamps room with the lamps okay okay which one&amp;#39;s the room with the lamps Oh you mean like the the lighting lamps bed open your ey go oh thanks DT we are playing another game after this we&amp;#39;re already to be playing got blood wash I just wanted to look at this stuff cuz I think fun little stuff like this in video games is neat the fact that I played it apparently in hard mode CU I just kind of like didn&amp;#39;t understand the uh that you can do this outside of the drawer menu and do that to open drawers okay so now we&amp;#39;re healed up so it&amp;#39;s upstairs I think cuz that&amp;#39;s where he came out of when he first aced the lady so there&amp;#39;s a drawer here that&amp;#39;s locked okay so there&amp;#39;s that one oh my God this whole mechanic like this whole mechanic oh my God that&amp;#39;s I wish there was a like if literally there was an option to like open your inventory what did I have what have I not done in this play through on this save didn&amp;#39;t I have to go in the basement at this point is this right before the boss fight so like that whole time there was like a mechanic that I just like didn&amp;#39;t know about cuz I couldn&amp;#39;t I assume because I couldn&amp;#39;t open my inventory in a drawer or like in a drawer menu that I couldn&amp;#39;t interact with the drawers when that was the case the whole time oh brother oh brother Ain&amp;#39;t That a Kick In The Head let&amp;#39;s see how easy this is without the uh or with with with a pistol and then we&amp;#39;ll we&amp;#39;ll go on to blood wash yeah this is right before the boss fight too there&amp;#39;s pistol ammo where is it cuz I don&amp;#39;t think I&amp;#39;m locked into this [Music] yet I mean I we&amp;#39;ve already beat the game I don&amp;#39;t think it matters that much he he&amp;#39;ll probably won&amp;#39;t he he&amp;#39;ll I imagine he&amp;#39;ll probably go down to like four shotgun shots and three of these right you can&amp;#39;t be that impervious and also I&amp;#39;m fully health so I can like actually like do with him a little bit I&amp;#39;m not going back for one thing go to the attic use to the black light investig get through cabinet at the end of the hallway it&amp;#39;s at the end of the what I hate that I hate that like one of the most like I I guess you we proved you can beat the game without it so it&amp;#39;s not that horrible right but I hate that that like that like that&amp;#39;s never like established as something you could do because like this is shiny you know that had a little glit glisten to it so I assumed that that&amp;#39;s like that was like a oneoff one time thing to solve a puzzle but it&amp;#39;s actually a mechanic you have to use throughout the entire game which is like like it never one point cuz like at most other points in this game whenever there&amp;#39;s a mechanic you&amp;#39;re going to have to like use repeatedly it&amp;#39;s like it explains it it&amp;#39;s never explained this like at all go to the attic use the black light investigate through go in oh that was downstairs that was downstairs cuz it&amp;#39;s talking about the bunny rabbit hallway where I literally just was making open some other yeah it could literally add that like that smidge of dialogue that&amp;#39;s like you can maybe I can use this to open other locked drawers around the house like something that small that way I would have known that like that&amp;#39;s this is a mechanic in the game now cuz it certainly didn&amp;#39;t try to let me know it&amp;#39;s okay the game is beatable without it yeah that&amp;#39;s this one [Music] yep man haha now poker holy challenge I think the I think the point of this right now is to see how easy the this boss fight is without um now that we have the pistol [Music] where&amp;#39;s the then the shotgun that makes sense I want to see how easy this fight is without it or without uh needing to do the poker [Music] [ __ ] wait for my ston to go back up [Music] [Applause] C [Music] [Music] po pop rain drop drop top but goes pop pop pop oh [ __ ] he got confused and AI path the wrong direction okay I might be out I&amp;#39;m going to see yeah oh wait I had another clip interesting do I even need the shotgun wait you don&amp;#39;t even need the shotgun if you if you get the pistol what you don&amp;#39;t even need the shotgun if you find the pistol what like I didn&amp;#39;t I didn&amp;#39;t even use this thing what yo okay that&amp;#39;s nutty that&amp;#39;s absolutely nutty you like you just didn&amp;#39;t even need it like at all that&amp;#39;s interesting okay so that is murder house um that was pretty good I think it&amp;#39;s funny that I skipped an entire mechanic just cuz I didn&amp;#39;t know it existed probably makes the fight go faster I mean yeah he was only like two hits from Death after the forest shotgun blast with the poker but I feel like having to switch quickly to another weapon like in the middle of a fight it&amp;#39;s more scary than just like using the pistol and like just you know blasting away yeah oh that was mder us I uh I like that a lot the only thing I&amp;#39;m not Keon is the the content warning about to take away I think I kind of didn&amp;#39;t need it but you know it&amp;#39;s nowhere near as bad as uh frck frack and Whatchamacallit like Outlast 2 how bad that was oh it&amp;#39;s fantastic game I liked how there was actually a save system like for some reason puppet combo is so like anti- Safe Systems and like they love making you backtrack sometimes their whole whole game to to do stuff and I don&amp;#39;t I don&amp;#39;t get that I like the pencil system is it time to blood wash it is about time to blood wash like they they have this like weird thing with like making you repeat their games and I don&amp;#39;t know why so I like that there was a save system with pencils the pencil save system so like I actually didn&amp;#39;t have to redo o things over and over and over and it&amp;#39;s fun in the fact that like like there when we we found out we miss some things we could just reload a Save and Go mess around you know so like I don&amp;#39;t know I think it&amp;#39;s just better and I&amp;#39;m glad that they did that I like the cold open with with the kid at the mall I think that&amp;#39;s really really cool and how it leads into the rest of the story yeah it&amp;#39;s just really cool and I like this game a lot so yeah uh I&amp;#39;m going to use the restroom and uh get more drink uh before we start this next game because I&amp;#39;ve been sitting here for four straight hours four and a half straight hours really and as soon as I do that I will be right back and we will start blood wash which will be our last last game of the evening which I very very thoroughly enjoyed uh these are all on par with like n Massacre n Massacre has obviously been my favorite so far so yeah I will be uh right back friendos H not",

um like uh streaming free streaming software but like it is kind of the clunkiest one as well like uh that was on streamlabs before all that stuff came out like for most of my streaming career and like streamlabs was way easier to use it was more intensive on my CPU way more intensive on my CPU but um like in terms of uh in terms of uh like clunky is like it was pretty solid whereas OBS I feel like screws up like all the time whereas streamlabs didn&amp;#39;t but you know gming yo same Des I am having a day having a day today but hopefully you&amp;#39;re well you&amp;#39;re doing fine yeah

was drifting Southwest but I&amp;#39;m not sure anymore oh they&amp;#39;ve grown up time I think we should just bed down somewhere and wait for it to pass I can&amp;#39;t shake the thought of us getting caught in what happened to our brother it just keeps coming it&amp;#39;s slow but that almost makes it worse we should keep moving it worked for us so far as long as we stay supplied we fine

like out of her mind or anything brother [ __ ] relax about to go out a dare speech oh when I found out David had kids I told him I am not changing who I am around them and when he proposed I reminded him that I&amp;#39;m not exactly stepmother material case in point it was reassuring but yeah I could tell he was worried about it I knew he&amp;#39;d tried to get me to change it&amp;#39;s not that big of a deal at least you&amp;#39;d hope that being around the kids more would change me you know I suppose it did literally as somebody who is straight edged myself and took like like that pledge when I was like 13 14 like I don&amp;#39;t take it that seriously that&amp;#39;s my life that&amp;#39;s my choices and that&amp;#39;s things I do for me you within the realm of like you know not hurting others are allowed to do whatever the heck you want right the key thing obviously being like as long as you&amp;#39;re not hurting other people like you do whatever you do whatever right especially just like one like relax I think you&amp;#39;re doing a fine job don&amp;#39;t be cheesy all right I&amp;#39;m not fishing for compliments well you caught one all right so now what I used to talk [ __ ] about all those mothers who go on about raising their kids being the hardest thing in the world she well thanks manand I appr appreciate it wish you all too bud have a good rest your think they had a point his mood swings are just I don&amp;#39;t know some days I just want leing by the side of the road I&amp;#39;m joking Jesus obviously you really shouldn&amp;#39;t say things like that I didn&amp;#39;t mean to be that confrontational it&amp;#39;s half a joke it&amp;#39;s all joke look I love these kids but I could do without Gabe reminding me I&amp;#39;m not his mother whenever he&amp;#39;s pissed he&amp;#39;s a teenager puberty hormones yeah the second you start getting boners the whole world starts to get dark what are you talking about sounds delightful compared to dealing with bloody underwear Christ I need to get laid his face you know the kids can hear you I like pull over parents talking about that stepmoms and uncles don&amp;#39;t count they&amp;#39;re asleep and besides we&amp;#39;re not really their parents still what&amp;#39;s that smell that&amp;#39;s gross hey Mariana shouldn&amp;#39;t you be uh sleeping he&amp;#39;s doing his best to cover for her I already know you guys do drugs that&amp;#39;s a pretty severe way of phrasing it Mariana don&amp;#39;t tell Gabe he&amp;#39;s the one who told me oh oh my God you&amp;#39;re even smoking in the car now going new chapter yet season three everyone roll the windows down before you all get pretty good so far we&amp;#39;re about to make a supply stop what I really appreciate so far is like the camera work is so like vastly improved like it really does feel like I&amp;#39;m like playing a show or a movie they really tried to put like a cinematic uh touch on everything here waiting his whole life for that it [ __ ] look like it man his eyes popped up and everything you want a moment alone Mari I&amp;#39;m praying I find a candy bar all right what do we actually need uh a candy bar need Mariana not want pretty much everything if it looks useful let&amp;#39;s use it all right well let&amp;#39;s start with some gas and move up from there but somebody already tried to take him out ooh the new prompts look cool too oh I just hey thanks fore weapon e hey where you going okay that&amp;#39;s cool have fun Jesus it never ends with him I hate when they fight like that I really hate it it&amp;#39;s like all Gabe wants to do is argue hey I know that&amp;#39;s what families do they fight they make up and they fight all over again at least you have your headphones yeah but the batteries have been dead for a couple of weeks oh I mostly wear them to fool you guys well when you put it that way I wish I had a pair too you can borrow mine if you want no I might just have to do that be nice to find some dinner in a junkyard you never know these past four years people have been hoarding all kinds of [ __ ] in all kinds of places oh and Mari if there&amp;#39;s any TR you find

of that one and we&amp;#39;d be gone in seconds hey don&amp;#39;t think about that we&amp;#39;re careful we&amp;#39;re smart we&amp;#39;ll stay ahead of them luck runs out just as easily as gas there&amp;#39;s going to be a last one you know a last tank of gas last piece of food what if this place is empty and and the next and the next we&amp;#39;re not going to let that happen Okay okay I let it have its 5 minutes that&amp;#39;s good it&amp;#39;s healthy yeah it&amp;#39;s good that&amp;#39;s good confront the feelings but don&amp;#39;t don&amp;#39;t let it like impact your long term that&amp;#39;s healthy especially in a [ __ ] zombie apocalypse come to Papa I love that emote I love the new emotes of like anything it&amp;#39;s like poorly drawn Pepe I love those so much I I I I approve of this uh this movement I think these tires would fit the van just keep evolving it&amp;#39;s true wonderful I&amp;#39;m in a bad mood okay I want it to go away but it won&amp;#39;t I just wish we weren&amp;#39;t always on the road I like being with other people mhm just we&amp;#39;re in that car for so damn long the AC hasn&amp;#39;t worked in ages and then it ate my last damn tape then we&amp;#39;ll get sick of other people instead of each other I don&amp;#39;t know maybe just leave me alone okay but if you want to talk later I&amp;#39;m around at least I got a smile out of him I got a smile that people are raised like that is true Bingo where&amp;#39; everybody go go I wish I could like unplay Resident Evil 4 make that way I could just play it again for like the first time that I really wish could do cuz I love that game a lot some sort of fuel tank opening communication is key yep can&amp;#39;t fix things if you don&amp;#39;t communicate too risky to search up there doesn&amp;#39;t look stable R2 R2 is another great one I guess not I&amp;#39;m clicking it uh okay I guess I guess I don&amp;#39;t do that he doesn&amp;#39;t even like comment or anything weird that&amp;#39;s a bug or something acetylene handy for welding but not much else hey those get stuck easy we learn that from Clen okay I get something that won&amp;#39;t get stuck in the zombie get you killed I&amp;#39;m communicate that I don&amp;#39;t want to communicate I mean people need their space and time sometimes just not communicating at all is bad not much yeah but every bit helps like with most things in life uh somewhere in the middle is usually the healthy road and not uh one extreme or the other lot of gas could be really handy if we stayed for a while that was like a big spider but it&amp;#39;s just a crane that big thing back there letting know that you&amp;#39;re there if or when yeah like it basically most things are fine as long as you just like you know um you know give concrete concreteness to these things right like time details that sort of thing like you said hey any kind of like what uh did he was like hey I&amp;#39;m here for you just something to write with a pen why are you looking for that like I&amp;#39;m respecting your space right now but I&amp;#39;m still here you know I really need to do and I need to pen for it last night I was thinking about this stupid story my mom used to tell me all the time before bed I used to hate it but but then I realized I don&amp;#39;t remember the ending it was this goofy ending she thought was so funny and I thought was so dumb I want to write down everything I can remember about everything cuz if I forget and they&amp;#39;re all gone I&amp;#39;m kind of gone too at least a little bit that&amp;#39;s deep I just think that might be kind of important maybe that&amp;#39;s a great idea Mariana named her after a trench huh my mouse is getting kind of stuck sometimes I don&amp;#39;t know if that&amp;#39;s my mouse or the game or what okay so we look for a pen for her now just rotting bits of Olden named after someone too right well listen listen listen there was a joke there and now it&amp;#39;s ruined

I&amp;#39;m sorry if there&amp;#39;s don&amp;#39;t go trouble true I am also do to help not that I have much to offer you but I know a thing of you about losing family hey it&amp;#39;s okay you&amp;#39;ve done enough I hear you but Elanor you done yet just about all right here&amp;#39;s what we&amp;#39;re going to do I&amp;#39;m driving you that junkyard myself get you out of my hair and no one can say I didn&amp;#39;t do right by no one in the meantime you two can sleep right here and think about what [ __ ] you were earlier on my terms and on my timeline you got me all right fair enough fair enough go kiss a skunks ass I should be earning a goddamn Boy Scout badge for this funny trip it doesn&amp;#39;t seem right to wait jav people they can chips that&amp;#39;s weird no no way just put you in that kind of danger again that&amp;#39;s not your call I got that smart pop stuff I&amp;#39;m not sure how I feel about it look too much maybe there&amp;#39;s another way trying that lately we&amp;#39;ve got a rear gate down to the other end of the Airfield we don&amp;#39;t use it much but well we could leave tonight slip past the herd get a jump start and reaching that junkyard what seriously when you do that for me it&amp;#39;s just it&amp;#39;s the right thing to do anyway think about it I&amp;#39;ve got to check on some patience but I&amp;#39;ll be back in an hour you know I never would have guessed she had it in her yeah she&amp;#39;s she&amp;#39;s something the thing is and maybe this sounds weird but I still trust trip more than I trust her this one&amp;#39;s weird this one I don&amp;#39;t know cuz like obviously if we go with trip in the morning he&amp;#39;s not going to be you know obviously we don&amp;#39;t like burn what is one of the like the few safe places out there in the uh middle of this big apocalypse but also he does have a point that like his family&amp;#39;s out there like right now dealing with Bandits right like right this moment so it is kind of like a like a time sensitive thing cuz you we can&amp;#39;t guarantee that they&amp;#39;re safe so like it is kind of like yeah I&amp;#39;m going to go with leaving with her tonight because like I can&amp;#39;t guarantee that they&amp;#39;re safe and yeah like you said there&amp;#39;s Walkers as well yeah elor if it gets us there even a minute sooner it&amp;#39;s worth it yeah I got to do I got to do me for my family you know when I met you I thought you&amp;#39;d just be another [ __ ] like everyone else and to think that when we first met you nearly blew my head off yeah guess I made the right call sounds like Elanor will be a little while maybe we should get a few Winks good idea yeah it&amp;#39;s funny this rly brought up to my head like a lot of people ate re3 make because it is a shorter game compared to the original but that&amp;#39;s kind of like why I like it I&amp;#39;ve played that game a lot more than I thought I have like I I&amp;#39;ve done like three or four playthroughs of that which is something I&amp;#39;ve only done with the like the original reu make like the first one which is my favorite game and I I play it more because it&amp;#39;s short so it&amp;#39;s not like not much of a commitment to go back play that game you know as much as it would be like a massive undertaking for like re2 or re4 make you know so I guess that&amp;#39;s a actually a weird positive about it you know which is lot what some a lot of people point out is a negative oh we&amp;#39;re getting flashbacks that&amp;#39;s good getting into first gear is the hardest part now just stay on the road oh look at it updated K is he&amp;#39;s getting older too sh into second I don&amp;#39;t know how to drive manual that was funny I was shopping uh trying to look at getting a at all getting shopping for cars the other day and there were some really cheaper ones that I wanted to look at and I was wondering why they were cheaper you know like what&amp;#39;s the catch I want to do it again but I was like oh they&amp;#39;re in manual that&amp;#39;s why you will and next time just be gentle they weren&amp;#39;t automatic and once we get down to Florida

CH yeah cuz I got the Flash all right let&amp;#39;s keep going see what people chose yeah it&amp;#39;s a little less interesting because we&amp;#39;re not playing it in the Heyday so a lot of decisions are more even than they probably were when the game first came out Summer&amp;#39;s still interesting though why are we back here please let me do the dishes that&amp;#39;s the least I can do season four now it&amp;#39;s season three crashing here Crashers clean dishes your family besides if they&amp;#39;re not clean the right way David becomes a big baby about it all yeah I&amp;#39;ve

thank you for staying I think you probably saved my life I couldn&amp;#39;t leave you alone alone that&amp;#39;s because you&amp;#39;re a good man not good enough to save her you bought your people time though that counts for something then she&amp;#39;s the best yeah I&amp;#39;m sorry I never found you those candy bars you deserved so much more life you should have been the one burying me since someday someday far away you did everything you possibly [Music] what do I have to shoot him that&amp;#39;s a waste of ammo that&amp;#39;ll draw more people oh I cannot do that cool wait CL that was still not the right choice for the same reasons that I said the other guys had this too oh [ __ ] what what&amp;#39;s wrong CLM I&amp;#39;ve run into these guys before who are they please they call themselves The New Frontier hey that&amp;#39;s the name of the season they used to be decent people now they&amp;#39;re something else this brand they have it&amp;#39;s like an initiation thing I was kind of stuck in their camp for a while not by choice it was bad I&amp;#39;m lucky to be alive bad how I got out that&amp;#39;s all that matters they left one of their cars behind that&amp;#39;s something at least good just like you always wanted I can take you back to Prescott make sure your family&amp;#39;s okay but then I&amp;#39;m hitting the road you should stay with us let&amp;#39;s just get back to Prescott that&amp;#39;s not a no that&amp;#39;s not a no you didn&amp;#39;t say no Chad you didn&amp;#39;t say no you&amp;#39;re back my family did Elanor get them here okay she did though okay isn&amp;#39;t the word I&amp;#39;d use to describe them Eleanor&amp;#39;s been doing what she can you best get over to the infirmary you made it back she asked for you you know I got here as soon as I could those guys didn&amp;#39;t go down without a fight and then Mariana I manag to stabilize her those bastards did her one favor at least any lower and that bullet would have torn her stomach lining as well your boy Gabe he seems really Fierce he wanted to help so badly he practically forced me to let him stay that&amp;#39;s gab but she was bleeding so much he got overwhelmed so when&amp;#39;s she going to be up on her feet again she&amp;#39;s stable for now but she&amp;#39;s still bleeding inside I don&amp;#39;t want to lie to you it&amp;#39;s probably just a matter of time damn I I wish wish I could do more thanks for trying and for not sugarcoating it wish I had something better to tell you but I&amp;#39;m sorry Javi I&amp;#39;m going to get cleaned up you may want to find Gabe he look pretty upset when he left this isn&amp;#39;t going to make him feel any better still I&amp;#39;ll track him down for real stop quit how&amp;#39;s she doing not great as well as can be expected yeah considering if you&amp;#39;d waited for me instead of sneaking off the way you did I could have helped would have been useful in a fight at least not that you had any way of knowing those [ __ ] are going to show up same thing crossed my mind believe me but I couldn&amp;#39;t wait to go after my family next time if there is a next time wait a little longer okay that some human patience hell of a situation just know I&amp;#39;m praying for you all of you whatever happens you all are welcome to stick around in Prescott if that&amp;#39;s what you want nobody&amp;#39;s going to force you but we&amp;#39;d be glad to have you all here not going to make a decision like that without talking to Kate so I&amp;#39;d rather check in with her when she&amp;#39;s feeling better you know sure thing let the lady weigh in first yeah that&amp;#39;s incredibly kind of patience for him after what we did wonder if it would have been faster than the horses flew in a plane just like this to a baseball game in Arkansas once lifetime ago hey have you seen a kid come through here blood all over his hands dark look on his face head it off that way without saying a word if I were you I give him some space just my advice one parent to another he&amp;#39;s had a really bad day can&amp;#39;t let him go off by himself not right now sorry to hear that that blood I take it that wasn&amp;#39;t his his stepmom&amp;#39;s you got to stay strong for her do whatever it takes know if my friend SE when the same situation I&amp;#39;d fight like hell anything we can do to help you out just let me know I am I appreciate that your boy stomped off towards the front gate yeah Gabe Gabe come on look at me that&amp;#39;s why I didn&amp;#39;t bury it with her by the way I don&amp;#39;t deserve to have this I want to go back and bury Mariana We buried her it was peaceful how could it have been peaceful I know how much you miss her Gabe I miss her too and Kate she needed me during her surgery she needed my help I just ran away like a stupid little kid you stayed long enough to do some good and because of that I&amp;#39;m proud of you you were there for her as much as you could be that doesn&amp;#39;t count yes hard to see that I&amp;#39;m done feeling this way feeling powerless well brother I can&amp;#39;t be some helpless little boy anymore I need to be a man just like my dad was he knew how men were supposed to act what you said sounds real nice but easier said than done I don&amp;#39;t care if it&amp;#39;s not easy next time I&amp;#39;m not going to sit back back and watch I&amp;#39;m going to do something I have to listen Gabe uhoh ah doesn&amp;#39;t seem good get inside now they&amp;#39;re running animations they&amp;#39;re so quirky hkin love toxic yeah just

Gabe and Mariana were just going to wake up and we would just be gone I&amp;#39;m right here okay I&amp;#39;m here you&amp;#39;re here we&amp;#39;re still alive and like letting go matter a lot of horror is very like like horror as a genre is very like hopeful and weirdly healing which is why I like it as a genre so much because there&amp;#39;s just little things that you don&amp;#39;t even think about that kind of like like obviously a lot of a lot of zombie meia also deals with that like like that hope aspect of pushing forward regardless of how shitty things are and each little like different uh genre adds and has its own like kind of like not lesson I would say but kind of like you know perseverance to it you know which is why I enjoy it want to stay here in the house and wait

this planet because he put it in them not immediate trip oh God Elanor we found the car without you don&amp;#39;t what he&amp;#39;s put in where I guess that&amp;#39;s true up and I don&amp;#39;t know his penis lore I came here looking for help and this happened I&amp;#39;ve been so worried about Kate I told them she needed a doctor they promised me someone would look into it well luckily we found her before she got any worse they just took her to the hospital I can&amp;#39;t believe no one went to look for her I&amp;#39;m sorry Javi really but I didn&amp;#39;t have any reason not to believe that you imagine if I had like leaned hard into like Rising her up into this point cuz we we&amp;#39;ve definitely had the option to like to like RIS up Kate up into this point imagine if I had done that and then this plot just happened man we would be in we be in so much trouble so much trouble what the people here in Richmond their new frontier you didn&amp;#39;t see the big ass [ __ ] logo you ain&amp;#39;t even heard the worst part yet one of them&amp;#39;s his brother uh not one of them the leader bebs I didn&amp;#39;t even know you had a brother Javi Hey Nobody&amp;#39;s more surprised than me I thought the guy was dead we haven&amp;#39;t seen David in years it&amp;#39;s just been Me Kate and the kids this whole time I don&amp;#39;t even want to think about what the odds are but he did seem pretty damn surprised to see you whoever this guy is he can&amp;#39;t be all bad right I don&amp;#39;t know I mean he helped Kate instead of hauling her down here of course he brought her inside she&amp;#39;s damn wife you&amp;#39;re kidding Kate is married to your brother the only reason I know Kate is because she married David that was the best man at their wedding wow okay family drama aside hope you know I&amp;#39;m not about to make f up not R up f up gave her some uh know you didn&amp;#39;t have much steak in Prescott they burn that place to the ground for no [ __ ] reason sure after everything you folks told me I&amp;#39;m guessing I&amp;#39;m not going to find my people alive hell H they killed your niece shot Kate for all we know your brother could have been behind it I don&amp;#39;t think he was even if it wasn&amp;#39;t his idea in the first place if he knew about it and didn&amp;#39;t stop it that&amp;#39;s one hell of an accusation saying he had his own family shot you really believe he&amp;#39;d do something like that after seeing how he was with Kate yeah he could be a piece of [ __ ] but I don&amp;#39;t think he would be crazy what was he like when you knew at very least self- serving you guys get along he seemed happy enough to see up there at least at first things between me and him were complicated some days we&amp;#39;d be at each other&amp;#39;s throats other days we could shoot the [ __ ] for hours and still find stuff to talk about so he&amp;#39;s a moody son of a [ __ ] huh if your brother knew anything about what happened in Prescott he&amp;#39;s got an answer for it they all do I owe that to Conrad I&amp;#39;m not just going to let things slide I&amp;#39;ve never really been an ey fory kind of man but people died yeah

without them before you didn&amp;#39;t have a ruptured spleen before these people nearly killed me Javi David&amp;#39;s people have you forgotten Mari of course not it&amp;#39;s always been you and me on the road Javi that&amp;#39;s how we&amp;#39;ve made it this far this weird like thing you got going on with me you need to chill you need to chill we get this place it&amp;#39;s a cage I hear you Kate but we can&amp;#39;t just turn our backs on this place on my brother I didn&amp;#39;t mean like that we have to try to make it work I used to say that about my [ __ ] up marriage guess it still applies I didn&amp;#39;t mean it like that just please please don&amp;#39;t leave me alone for to is ending yeah but like she&amp;#39;s got a she&amp;#39;s okay she&amp;#39;s got a a close close that [ __ ] down with him and then handle all her baggage with that and then Tois me that she was skipping a lot of steps there she was rambling a bit Yeah I think she&amp;#39;s Delirious well she seems cogent now but it&amp;#39;s nothing to be alarmed about pain often comes in waves with abdominal wounds no I mean even before that even before that like in like you know in normal people times when she was trying to rise me up I thought I&amp;#39;d have to operate but all she needed was IV fluids and some antibiotics how did you find someone with skills like these wound like this kills n out of 10 we got lucky we met a group with a medic Elanor just before Kate got shot the same group in quarantine now to she&amp;#39;s there now we should let her out I&amp;#39;ll vouch for her agreed I have AA bring her here I want to meet this Elanor I&amp;#39;m sure she&amp;#39;ll be an asset to our community you can vouch for the rest of them too right it doesn&amp;#39;t work that way but we&amp;#39;ll make the case for them soon Javi and I have to go meet some people now see if we I mean if the people want to stay here they&amp;#39;re more than welcome to stay here like I don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s a good idea that&amp;#39;s free will man people make bad decisions all the time people want to stay people want to stay like I can&amp;#39;t my David I won&amp;#39;t be able to make it feeling okay fine I just want to keep an eye on my patient the others know my vote is with you come on remember what I said when we meet these guys keep what happened to Marana to yourself Badger is one of my guys and I will handle him it seems like you&amp;#39;re hiding from the consequences of what you did don&amp;#39;t like that it may look pretty but it&amp;#39;s all sugars there&amp;#39;s no substance I mean after season 2 that&amp;#39;s all that matters with season 2 we saw how much you know as a main character kind of was problematic I can see why Clint runs fuction the crops you saw that&amp;#39;s him and his people Jones are bridge to the outside world she handles contact with other settlements pleased to meet you hary I trust you&amp;#39;ve been treated well I hope you haven&amp;#39;t been handled too roughly some of our people left their courtesy with their old lives no complaints here I get that you guys have a way of doing things thank you we have to be careful I&amp;#39;m sure you can understand we were just about to eat Clint was trying to convince me of the essential superiority of his cream spinach over my magnificent Black Forest gateau it&amp;#39;s no contest the spinach has real nutritional value Javi take a look at that table you tell me what you&amp;#39;d rather put in your belly spinach from Clint&amp;#39;s Garden or a baked delicacy by Yours Truly well I&amp;#39;m with Clint got to eat your greens if you want to grow up big and strong ah exactly at least you&amp;#39;re being honest MH please make yourself comfortable yeah she&amp;#39;s a little older but she&amp;#39;s still like we value straight talk here so please forgive me if I seem direct we&amp;#39;re usually pretty strict about who we open our doors to your brother&amp;#39;s word counts for a lot is that so the three of us and Dr lingard make all the decisions here so yeah people who choose to stay with us they have to deal with us bossing them around not saying you wouldn&amp;#39;t but it can be an adjustment especially for more independent-minded there&amp;#39;s no structure out there now people get used to doing as they please no offense but what qualifies you to lead testing us already just curious who&amp;#39;s leading the troops into battle everything you see we built ourselves if that&amp;#39;s not an endorsement I don&amp;#39;t know what is when Joon and I met your brother he was trying his hand at fruit fruit we found him slowly murdering an orchard on the shanoa river hot [ __ ] ha I helped him bring it back to life soon we had a good run there for as long as it lasted what happened what always happens we trusted the wrong damn people that&amp;#39;s what led us to start this wondering what this fine piece of body art is all about have seen that Mark a few times you probably saw it at the gates right hobby we all took it as a sign of commitment it was a crude answer to a difficult problem and it hasn&amp;#39;t always worked please understand we had a terrible winter just after we moved here we we lost a great deal loved ones who left holes in our lives protecting my people from that kind of pain that&amp;#39;s what keeps me awake at night but to what cost it turned me into a Perpetual Night Owl I know it&amp;#39;s a lot to ask you can&amp;#39;t protect people Joan not complet completely not anymore you&amp;#39;re probably right that doesn&amp;#39;t mean we don&amp;#39;t have to try Max what are you doing here I sent for him since when does he answer to you from what I hear he&amp;#39;s well acquainted with your brother they exchanged a few bullets outside our walls this is getting spicy right is there bad blood between you and Max nothing that can&amp;#39;t be worked out let&amp;#39;s just say I wouldn&amp;#39;t invite him to my wedding yeah I wouldn&amp;#39;t [ __ ] go good because I just said you wouldn&amp;#39;t be invited Max how did this start don&amp;#39;t look at him you have an obligation to tell the truth we caught him siphoning gas from one of our vehicles Max sorry David I know he&amp;#39;s family but your brother&amp;#39;s a thief is it true answer her I was Scavenging whatever I could find I had no idea it belonged to you if you just asked we&amp;#39;d have given it to you really I doubt that that that&amp;#39;s not all said Clementine ran his truck off the road just to break him free Clementine girl we had trouble with in the past you can always judge a man by the company he keeps running with that girl don&amp;#39;t look good I would say not oh I don&amp;#39;t like oh I I&amp;#39;m going to go for his friends yeah let&amp;#39;s judge you then you got some colorful friends so what if jav met up with Clementine it doesn&amp;#39;t mean anything we kicked her out for a reason David now the two of them are thick as thieves really she&amp;#39;s not her own this is who you&amp;#39;re asking us to vouch for David seriously you know we can&amp;#39;t just open our doors to Bandits I&amp;#39;m a bandit we&amp;#39;re trying to build something different here you think I&amp;#39;m bad you have Maniacs running around out there who are much much worse that&amp;#39;s I&amp;#39;m not sure what you mean we hold our people to the highest standards do you Javi you have something to say one of your people some [ __ ] called Badger he put a bullet in a little girl my niece David&amp;#39;s daughter what damnn it jav I told you I&amp;#39;d handle it no David this cousin [ __ ] dirt bag has the balls to accuse me he and Badger destroyed an entire town that&amp;#39;s enough yep no we need to hear this exactly that&amp;#39;s my thing they need hear this sounds like you&amp;#39;ve got more to get off your chest they killed a hostage In Cold Blood a woman Francine Badger did that not me you were right there next to him I tried to get him to stop I swear cut off her damn finger first max I tried to stop him I swear he was out of control David we warned you about getting your soldiers in line we don&amp;#39;t know all the facts we know enough she&amp;#39;s right David you&amp;#39;ve lost control I want them gone all of them take Ki and everyone in the quarantine to the gate send them out with enough weapons to defend themselves wait why are we getting kicked out because they were shitty wait why are we being punished for their people acting like acting terribly look we can&amp;#39;t fight this not now we be safe here your doctor friend too but the rest of you you&amp;#39;re going to have to do what they say I&amp;#39;m sorry I can&amp;#39;t leave Kate and Gabe alone they won&amp;#39;t be alone I&amp;#39;ll be here to take care of them I can&amp;#39;t help you now but maybe I can down the road just stay alive yeah why are we being punished for their group&amp;#39;s decisions farmer guys seem to be like hey that&amp;#39;s [ __ ] up but like I don&amp;#39;t know why old lady reacted so like oh well then they need to go how&amp;#39;s that work you&amp;#39;re lucky I don&amp;#39;t gou your [ __ ] eyes out with my thumbs you hear me [ __ ] probably way aware of that they act I suppose so David

just see what they gave us knowing them it&amp;#39;s probably a butter knife and a stick of gum they could shot us more than once oh how [ __ ] neighborly and a map what&amp;#39;s that looks like a map I doubt they give one to everyone Ava did say David packed the bag why the hell is it tied to a baseball bat who WI my beard my back up but possible looks like they&amp;#39;re expanding some of these areas are marked clear okay there&amp;#39;s Richmond that helps but we can&amp;#39;t go back there knowing where it is lets us know where we are pretty sure David wants us to go there and if this is us here then I think we can head along this path just got to head north and to find North we need to find the North Star there the end of the Little Dipper no that&amp;#39;s the Big Dipper why are you doing it that&amp;#39;s it we need to go this way what else is in there not a whole lot flashlight not enough weapons no food let&amp;#39;s go trip come on what&amp;#39;s up I can&amp;#39;t

of here well you are owed a vehicle keep an eye on David he may be playing nice but I&amp;#39;d still watch your back I&amp;#39;m with you Clen he rubs me the wrong way as soon as I get Kate and Gabe I&amp;#39;m going to figure out what&amp;#39;s best for us well I hope it involves getting far away from here I think they&amp;#39;ll be here after this this is a like inss have been right most of the time I know you&amp;#39;ll make the right call see you when I see you hey that&amp;#39;s what I say that&amp;#39;s my line I say that that&amp;#39;s like my that&amp;#39;s like my my leaving J there you go seems clear so far let&amp;#39;s move What&amp;#39;s My Line you know jav Garcia used to play shortstop for Baltimore that Javier Garcia that&amp;#39;s who we&amp;#39;re looking for yeah that Javier Garcia anyway sounds like some paranoid horeshit guy&amp;#39;s a [ __ ] ball player there&amp;#39;s the medical center we go in we get El we get Kate and Gabe we get out what about our friends there doesn&amp;#39;t exactly look like a welcoming committee all right let&amp;#39;s hang out here for a while smoke break damn it we need a distraction how&amp;#39;s your throwing arm peble he has diversion [ __ ] we need to get the fire crew or that [ __ ] could burn down the block you couldn&amp;#39;t have just out a window H the didn&amp;#39;t it about to say you wanted a big distraction that&amp;#39;s a huge distraction there&amp;#39;s your distraction find L tell her we have to move Kate you got it I&amp;#39;ll meet you here still raining out like there&amp;#39;s some ring coming in might have to check that in a second we thought you were I was super worried we have to leave gab now oh okay I&amp;#39;m sorry they said you guys were denied entry it&amp;#39;s true we&amp;#39;re on borrowed time the people who run this place they&amp;#39;re ruthless we have to move where&amp;#39;s my dad is he coming your dad&amp;#39;s taking care of a few loose ends and right now he needs me to take care of you oh okay David has a house in town he thinks we&amp;#39;ll be okay there then let&amp;#39;s go wait Javi while you were gone this woman Joan came by I felt like she was sizing me up up it was creepy yeah she implied David was in trouble like he was no longer in charge she kept saying Gabe and I didn&amp;#39;t need to worry but it only made me worry more Joan&amp;#39;s been running this place behind David&amp;#39;s back she&amp;#39;s pulling the strings what do you mean the people who shot you answer to her she ordered raids on other settlements we found all this stuff from Prescott she was behind Prescot Scot David&amp;#39;s rounding up Allies to confront her right now Javi I know you wanted to try it here but this isn&amp;#39;t our fight we already lost Mari because of these people now I don&amp;#39;t know because like we can&amp;#39;t let Joan keep doing what she&amp;#39;s doing because she&amp;#39;s going to make settlements unsafe forever right not and like it would be nice to just like you know grab our two family members and just like you know kumbai on to the sunset but like we will we will never be safe unless we get we go far far away far far away they will like this has to end not even just for the sake of like the whole place is about to become a war zone I hear you Kate but we can&amp;#39;t just let her get away with it you&amp;#39;re not hearing me this is not our problem what&amp;#39;s going on trip said we had to move to David&amp;#39;s house we&amp;#39;re not doing that we&amp;#39;re getting the [ __ ] out of Richmond before it&amp;#39;s too late getting out you shouldn&amp;#39;t even be sitting up what what about my dad we can&amp;#39;t just leave him Gabe we don&amp;#39;t even know who he is anymore we have to get away before he gets us all killed she&amp;#39;ll find you he won&amp;#39;t know where we are I I hate this option because like what I would do is I would just say if if she wants to go she can go but for the best safy of like like continuing to keep them safe we got to end this thing CU you think once even like what if Joan wins and she gets David you think we&amp;#39;re not [ __ ] next you think she won&amp;#39;t have those Bandits out there looking for us no matter where the [ __ ] we go like we&amp;#39;re not safe it&amp;#39;s not about like you know like oh David&amp;#39;s the best guy ever and we&amp;#39;re totally safe here it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s we need to stop we need to stop the the bandits from ever chasing us down again that&amp;#39;s what it&amp;#39;s about again I can&amp;#39;t go back to how things were before we going to go to David&amp;#39;s house Javi it&amp;#39;s the best bet we got it&amp;#39;s all we got I&amp;#39;ve got a gun in the room they gave me sounds like we might need it yeah this isn&amp;#39;t about like I wish they could just run away like if they want to go they can go sounds good if they want to go they can go but like I we got to stop we got to stop the New Frontier don&amp;#39;t yeah I pissed her off it&amp;#39;s okay buddy she&amp;#39;s mad at me not you not that it&amp;#39;s you&amp;#39;ll think it&amp;#39;s stupidy what&amp;#39;s up I just wish Clementine was still with us no we ran into her really I hope she came back with you I I wish she was around I know I know she&amp;#39;s tough but if we run into her she could really use a friend right now yeah need to like I get why cuz she doesn&amp;#39;t want to be stuck in her [ __ ] marriage again and she&amp;#39;s been essentially out of it for 3 years like I get that and we can cross that bridge when we get to it but like the immediate danger is the New Frontier the immediate problem is the New Frontier we have to stop the New Frontier then we can handle anything and everything else after the fact when we are physically safe we are physically safe then we&amp;#39;re good you know this is what what David lives for right what a brawl I only ever saw him truly happy when he was talking about being at War the world going to [ __ ] I guarantee that was the best day of his life he gets to live life on the front line we were in the thick of it Kate if he thrives in this [ __ ] that only improves our chances just because he likes it doesn&amp;#39;t mean he&amp;#39;s good at it yeah like I I totally get exactly where Kate&amp;#39;s coming from

come back I came here to reconnect instead you just want to show me up but when I stopped showing you up you got mad what&amp;#39;s going on David I don&amp;#39;t understand you don&amp;#39;t understand because you about that was good visual storytelling talking about how upset he is and then zoomed in on his room for years you&amp;#39;ve always been looking out for yourself you tried to help me yeah let me help you you really want to help all right drive me down to the recruitment office next week the Army my job sucks Kate and I fight like cats and dogs there it is I belong back in the Army I had a purpose there I had respect last time you deployed you didn&amp;#39;t have kids so whatever you do now you got to put them first I am putting them first that&amp;#39;s why I have to leave that&amp;#39;s not how that works things between me and Kate have been going downhill for a while talk to each other go to counseling but if I left to be this way seemed like that would be best for everyone it seems like the conversation we&amp;#39;ve been having this week this is the life I want not anymore no the kids are too young for you to leave them you got to be around to you know coach him on stuff what the hell do you know about raising children hobby I&amp;#39;m not going to lie if I go it&amp;#39;s going to be hard on everyone Kate may need help from time to time you can help right she&amp;#39;s running from it you won&amp;#39;t leave her hanging I need to know that in my mind it&amp;#39;s your family David not mine you got to stay here to help them tip go selfish no I no that&amp;#39;s not being selfish and I [ __ ] hate people that do this [ __ ] that&amp;#39;s not being selfish that&amp;#39;s holding you accountable that is the most selfless thing you can do for somebody you love is to make them get over their [ __ ] that&amp;#39;s toxic for them and if somebody does this [ __ ] to you in your life where they refuse to fix their [ __ ] that&amp;#39;s not on you that that is you doing the best for them and they just can&amp;#39;t [ __ ] see it that is not you that is not on you about family that the most selfless thing you can do is hold somebody accountable want them to improve want them to get better and if they don&amp;#39;t [ __ ] take that that&amp;#39;s shitty on them that&amp;#39;s the most selfless thing you can do matter of fact that&amp;#39;s the hardest selfless thing you can do it&amp;#39;s easy to cuddle somebody and try to just give them non-stop Comfort make them feel good if you truly love somebody you want them to improve and be the best version of themselves they possibly [ __ ] can be that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s what you do for them that&amp;#39;s what true love actually [ __ ] looks like not like take care of my kids cuz I&amp;#39;m going to go mop in the Army cuz I can&amp;#39;t [ __ ] take it hate that [ __ ] man man R your children exactly [ __ ] exactly get in there I&amp;#39;ll let you go on the road remember can&amp;#39;t you help us now course I remember it&amp;#39;s why I haven&amp;#39;t shot you already thanks helping you Jan&amp;#39;s making a huge mistake no you made a mistake when you murdered Lonnie hey everybody just take a breath all right I was just trying to tell them and that&amp;#39;s your mistake right there you can&amp;#39;t fight everybody understand that Jones not looking for Revenge she just wants order cooperation is the name of the game there&amp;#39;s still a way through this but you&amp;#39;ve got to let Joan enforce the laws you do anything she tells you to do huh go along with whatever she says just to keep your place it&amp;#39;s not like that Jones got a tough job she needs all our help to keep this place safe like making other places unsafe she&amp;#39;s a Raider you always want to make it out of here just relax and Trust in the process oh yeah trust me the process has done us so much good in life this is bad what are we going to do I killed Lonnie Christ how could he turn on me like that David hey I thought I had it handled all of this is my goddamn fault I should have seen it coming but I dropped the ball no you can&amp;#39;t stop evil people from doing evil things you couldn&amp;#39;t have anticipated that yeah it was a sneak attack I&amp;#39;m glad you see that you may be the only one I keep doing this making the same stupid mistakes remember when you wanted to run away and reinlist yeah you talked me out of it hey your fought to keep your family you can do it again now listen to me carefully I don&amp;#39;t care what&amp;#39;s going to happen to me I&amp;#39;m most worried about Kate and Gabe they got to survive no matter what you don&amp;#39;t have to worry they&amp;#39;re safe for now we have to get them out of town both of us you&amp;#39;re right no matter what we do Jon&amp;#39;s already poisoned this well we&amp;#39;ve got to figure a way out of Richmond yeah all of us why I wanted to stop all of

should have left when we had a chance well we can&amp;#39;t now so we&amp;#39;ll matter stuck here I didn&amp;#39;t make that happened it&amp;#39;s not my fault we had the opportunity we should have gone are you crazy I&amp;#39;d rather take my chances out there than in here then you&amp;#39;re then you wouldn&amp;#39;t haveed seconds past those walls it seems like we&amp;#39;re in danger within this place and without I for one would feel a whole lot safer with a few more guns to protect ourselves mhm that the smartest move to make right now that&amp;#39;s crazy he&amp;#39;s my brother Kate I have to yeah we have to rescue David damn straight we and we might have to face those Mor I know where there&amp;#39;s guns my dad showed me there are lots the Armory good idea a small group should go okay sounds like a plan we&amp;#39;ll get back here as soon as we can good luck come here Kate I just be careful cl&amp;#39;s okay look Javi I I don&amp;#39;t know if you HT us but I think I [ __ ] it up with Eleanor just we can talk on the way about that I don&amp;#39;t think I can leave this apartment with things like this between me and her I don&amp;#39;t the time for this brother but I know you must have at least heard something it happens especially these days don&amp;#39;t worry about it thanks oh I didn&amp;#39;t mean like just shouldn&amp;#39;t have pushed it with her like I did not right now though too much going on yeah not right now man come on yeah just give us a minute pal not right now I&amp;#39;m sorry buddy I just I don&amp;#39;t know what to do with all that&amp;#39;s going on here everybody&amp;#39;s feeling overwhelmed try to wait for the right time maybe she&amp;#39;ll come around uhhuh right okay good luck out there yeah now was not the time to be like I&amp;#39;ll talk it over with Eleanor and watch over things here yeah now&amp;#39;s not the time to be uhing that out happen to anyone thank you there&amp;#39;s too many more pressing issues good luck time will come for that there not now though stay frosty Jens what&amp;#39;s that mean Mike stay cool buddy why is it playing the song from season one it usually this plays during more emotional moments or like when climbs around looks like Bob&amp;#39;s oning kind of like on away from the door and meet you inside be careful in there there might be more of them I watched a really interesting video long time ago that was all about like how music is supposed like a guiding tool done this that&amp;#39;s why it&amp;#39;s important no you haven&amp;#39;t G so essentially I got like trick to there some decisions you know you make them in I&amp;#39;m hearing a season one thong or song which I associate with like CLM Kenny like that era so like I was trained to kind of like look out for Clen because I&amp;#39;m hearing this song yeah but like she&amp;#39;s not here think I do so it&amp;#39;s kind of like a misfire of Music if that makes sense how can we trust that you won&amp;#39;t turn us uh that guided me incorrectly trust her your father trusts her and we trust him right yeah then we should be okay I hope how do you know when you can trust someone I feel like I&amp;#39;ve never really known anyone other than you and Kate Mariana through their actions they can try to confuse you with their words but someone worth your trust does good things makes sense I think we&amp;#39;re up she sure is a big help media too yeah some musics some music lose their identity some music lose their Identity or some like musical things lose their identity because it&amp;#39;s overused or used incorrectly cuz like for example the reason I was even looking for like Clen in this scene was because I heard that song which means up until this point the their like training their guiding tool with it so far had been um you know correct like they done a good job of it but like you know now I have that one little doubt of like okay well we&amp;#39;ll use this outside of this now said it&amp;#39; be this way not to say that rehashing and republish not republishing but you know recycling themes and using them for you know repurposing them for new uh you know characters moments Etc it&amp;#39;s a bad thing but like I don&amp;#39;t think that really fit there yeah the guns are through that door locked no time to look for a key either have to do this the hard way you should check those if you haven&amp;#39;t lately make sure your fire extinguisher is not uh expired why is that making so much [ __ ] noise like echoing like a [ __ ] gunshot there take his Bat back like somebody probably hasn&amp;#39;t fired one of those yeah he he looked at like like he he was not uh we never done this before you and me we make a pretty good team right the uncle nephew one two Punch Yeah we do sorry to scare you when we get back to Eleanor&amp;#39;s we need to talk to those people about doing the right thing by this place I&amp;#39;ll meet you at the entrance I&amp;#39;m with you I&amp;#39;m with you I know I know if they want to leave they can leave but I&amp;#39;m with you I&amp;#39;m like we are no one no one in this area like this no one in this entire area of existence geographically is safe until these guys are deal with I&amp;#39;m with you come here freeze oh get away from ow holy [ __ ] that hurt Javi you&amp;#39;re bleeding are you okay oh my God not dead yet I&amp;#39;m so sorry jeez I can&amp;#39;t leave you guys alone for two minutes can I he&amp;#39;s still alive yeah just passed out starting to think siding with you might have not been the best idea toss Sleeping Beauty in the closet soon Seas him let me see that wound it&amp;#39;s really leing you&amp;#39;re going to need that taken care of [ __ ] no it&amp;#39;s okay lingard and David are close

let&amp;#39;s be quick it&amp;#39;s not the last episode yet I suppose so don&amp;#39;t leave the knife take it with you that&amp;#39;s not smart that&amp;#39;s not smart at all can they really hit targets over a mile away not these but some models Javi it&amp;#39;s probably best if lingard doesn&amp;#39;t see these guns he and David might be tight but he&amp;#39;s still part of Richmond&amp;#39;s Leadership Council I&amp;#39;ll keep watch with AA okay do any of them have laser sights what a teenage question Clen [ __ ] Javi what happened to you ran into a little trouble

out guess there&amp;#39;s only one sure way to get away from Joan these days why do you care if David got out he deserves what&amp;#39;s coming to him if you think that you don&amp;#39;t know David I know he&amp;#39;s the reason I lost AJ when AJ recovered David was the one who stepped up took personal responsibility for that kid you say that like it&amp;#39;s a good thing I really doubt he was a positive influence David&amp;#39;s the reason the kid&amp;#39;s better off now than than he&amp;#39;s ever been you can be as mad as you want about how about how things panned out CLM is AJ&amp;#39;s Family no kid is better off when you break their family apart maybe you&amp;#39;re right maybe AJ should be with Clen all I know is that he&amp;#39;s better than he was when he got here no thanks to you or David I stand by what I said if David&amp;#39;s Tak good care of him why did he tell me to ask you where aj is that&amp;#39;s what this is about then you you want to know where the boy is what are you doing what do you want I I just want to die I want you to inject this into me hang in there tomorrow&amp;#39;s another day I can&amp;#39;t when your brother found me he he got me to care about

another she&amp;#39;s trying thanks what took you so long we went to see Dr lingard at night I&amp;#39;m kind of surprised he was sober was it&amp;#39;s got to be a stressful job looking after an entire Community the guy&amp;#39;s clearly an addict he was destroyed when we got there it would be sad if it wasn&amp;#39;t so reckless as pathetic is what it is oh no no no you regret feeling that way Clen why don&amp;#39;t you go talk to Kate okay okay the sun will be rising in a few hours Jones people know we&amp;#39;re hold up here and they&amp;#39;re going to come looking for us all of us for [ __ ] sake maybe it&amp;#39;s not as bad as we think [ __ ] you figures and there&amp;#39;s no going anywhere with those things blocking our exit they like me that has to help somehow just cuz they like you doesn&amp;#39;t mean they&amp;#39;re going to like the rest of us we&amp;#39;re sitting ducks up here hey we can do this yeah we&amp;#39;ve gotten out of tougher jams before haven&amp;#39;t we I mean sure but this is different we can&amp;#39;t just cut and run not with a herd out there like it or not we&amp;#39;re [ __ ] stuck in Richmond now how the [ __ ] are we going to put the brakes on this thing Joan and her people are going to be at the square right we need to bring the fight to them we go after Joan our problems are solved great so how do we do that it&amp;#39;s a good question Joan will probably have a full security detail with her she&amp;#39;ll be insulated from us and from anybody in Richmond who doesn&amp;#39;t agree with what she&amp;#39;s doing if there are good people left in Richmond who are against what Joan&amp;#39;s doing we need to ask for their help if we can talk to the people at the trial present the case to everyone in Richmond we might not have to do this on our own we like the match the people do the rest after we take Joan out we&amp;#39;re going to need some way out of this mess I don&amp;#39;t know about the rest of you I&amp;#39;m not much of a runner we&amp;#39;ve got a truck a big one that we used to use for Walker defense it&amp;#39;s a little bust it up but it&amp;#39;s way better than nothing people are going to be patrolling these streets looking for us how far away is this truck I&amp;#39;ll show you we&amp;#39;ve been expanding pushing out further making the safe Zone even bigger can&amp;#39;t promise you they&amp;#39;ve cleared all the Walkers yet but that&amp;#39;s where the trucks parked I could spit and hit it we steal that thing nothing will be able to stop us steal what hey Jesus Javi is that blood on your shirt you said it wasn&amp;#39;t that bad it isn&amp;#39;t how the hell did this happen you&amp;#39;re bleeding right through that bandage why would I be like sideways at the end Gabe got in the way a guard came after me and he stabbed me in the shoulder I thought you guys were going to be careful out there hey hey don&amp;#39;t worry about it yeah it is what it is everybody&amp;#39;s in one piece thought you knew what you were doing a little injured still alive aren&amp;#39;t you elanar can you take a look at this as long as he keeps it clean it should be okay would you guys stop making such a big deal about it I it happened it&amp;#39;s over move on already I&amp;#39;m just trying to make sure he&amp;#39;s okay Gabe what we need to be talking about is the plan oh I have a bunch of ideas I want to be the one to go after Dad just give me a gun and I&amp;#39;ll do whatever I know the town I know what dad&amp;#39;s going to be thinking hey hey hey hey hey slow down would you you&amp;#39;re getting way ahead of yourself who&amp;#39;s to say you&amp;#39;re even coming along kid are you [ __ ] kidding me uh he&amp;#39;s coming along he just this is [ __ ] wait is he not stay behind Gabe take a breath I wasn&amp;#39;t saying he was going to stay behind he&amp;#39;s my dad I&amp;#39;m going it&amp;#39;s going to be dangerous out there and I don&amp;#39;t want anyone else getting hurt no I&amp;#39;m I&amp;#39;m I&amp;#39;m not oppos to bring you if you get to save dad then getting hurt is worth it it&amp;#39;s worth dying for this is more important to me than anyone else I&amp;#39;ve got a gun and I know how to use it you&amp;#39;re out of control Gabe first the [ __ ] at the Armory now this wait no how am I supposed to trust you to do anything is there no way to like cut the kids some slack is everybody just unanimously like including Javier just like [ __ ] this guy like is there there was literally no option to side with him there like in either of those like in either of the two I don&amp;#39;t like that say nobody will die I guess how are any of us nobody here is going to let you be a martyr Gabe your life is precious well that&amp;#39;s true life is precious then how come you shot Conrad huh back in the tunnel when he came after us he tried to bargain with you I saved your life too in case you didn&amp;#39;t remember that part so what you shot him you killed him what the [ __ ] Javi is she telling the truth you murdered my friend what the [ __ ] did you do that for he had a gun on them if I hadn&amp;#39;t killed him he was going to shoot Clementine and Gabe he&amp;#39;s telling the truth when Conrad found out that I used to run with new frontier he went crazy he would have pulled the trigger no question I guess we&amp;#39;ll never know right cuz he&amp;#39;s not here to tell his side of things you made sure of that looks like you&amp;#39;re a pretty [ __ ] dangerous person to be around OB first you kill my friend then you get me and my friends on Joan [ __ ] I think you need to give us some space jav [ __ ] that I don&amp;#39;t want to see you ever again well maybe I&amp;#39;d be better off with Joan at least I know she wants to stab me in the back you get the [ __ ] out and you stay gone or I can&amp;#39;t be held accountable I didn&amp;#39;t I didn&amp;#39;t want him to shoot we can take care of ourselves hell we stick around you much longer you&amp;#39;ll probably kill us too I&amp;#39;m sorry it happened the way it did really Conrad wasn&amp;#39;t a bad guy the situation was just just [ __ ] we better go get that truck I&amp;#39;ll uh get my stuff then call you on the walkie when I see things getting started in the Square save somebody&amp;#39;s life and that&amp;#39;s how

attention ready ready ready mashing it out man mashing it out turns out you needed me after all huh I&amp;#39;m just saying I&amp;#39;m glad you were here okay at least you can admit it yeah well it turns out you&amp;#39;re pretty useful when you actually follow directions don&amp;#39;t think those guys will be able to hear the engine all the way over here I put it in neutral couldn&amp;#39;t find an ignition key in there gu have to hotwire it I think it&amp;#39;s interesting that like just for the character change in Gabe that like now that he found he found his real dad he&amp;#39;s kind of turned on his fake dad or like not his fake Dad but he like his surrogate dad for the time they left their supplies lying around but there&amp;#39;ll be some tools it&amp;#39;s a very like it&amp;#39;s a shitty thing but it&amp;#39;s like it&amp;#39;s a natural thing I feel like a teenager would do but it shows an attention to the character detail you know like that was obviously the Lynch pin that caused that kind of change in attit dude oh okay almost there keep an eye out while I get it started okay I&amp;#39;ll check on the guys in the office Clen and I will look out for Walkers okay here goes no no no let me hot wire the car I want to be important wire cutters should help with this I don&amp;#39;t know it&amp;#39;s May shocky but I&amp;#39;ve never B wired a car know anything to you have a no can&amp;#39;t say I have let there be light with Ohio what about Ohio makes you think I have hotwired a car before what what about living in a specific State means that I I&amp;#39;ve hotwired a vehicle oh [ __ ] don&amp;#39;t get electrocuted don&amp;#39;t get electrocuted Javi hurry up I&amp;#39;m trying he let&amp;#39;s go the hot wires stop yelling I&amp;#39;m anxious well those guys are getting I don&amp;#39;t know thrown in jail executed whatever they do here they&amp;#39;re in trouble the square is a couple of blocks away this is a good place to wait do we have enough gas I&amp;#39;m not about to turn the engine off again what now we wait for AA to call us on the walkie so nothing for us to do but sit and watch the sun come up well I know we&amp;#39;ve got something important to do I&amp;#39;m teaching you to play uker that&amp;#39;s not a real thing it&amp;#39;s a card game come on it&amp;#39;s fun it&amp;#39;s nice to be driving around with a couple kids in the back seat again really takes you back doesn&amp;#39;t it just you and me and Gabe and maybe man how&amp;#39;s it going Mari you&amp;#39;re right this is nice if I just close my eyes we&amp;#39;re right back where we were all of us together I&amp;#39;m living do what I do you asking try to think about the nice stuff not everything that happened after gotcha come on that&amp;#39;s not even a good Rule still gotcha guess you stopped playing at ghol with her H uh in case you haven&amp;#39;t noticed gab&amp;#39;s got a little how do they not hear this in the front seat he like likes her you get it I hope it works out for them I really do they&amp;#39;re good for each other I she&amp;#39;s a dramatically dramatically more emotionally uh mature than wild he is Young Love it&amp;#39;s so normal you know like as crazy as things get as terrible and tragic and just plain stupid there&amp;#39;s nothing more wonderfully ordinary as two kids falling for each other not that they&amp;#39;re there yet but to feel something that intensely for another person hey the falling in love is the easy part it&amp;#39;s the staying in Love Part that&amp;#39;ll really mess you up it&amp;#39;s unfair that&amp;#39;s all I&amp;#39;m saying that they&amp;#39;re feeling what they&amp;#39;re feeling right now and when that sun gets a little higher it&amp;#39;s right back to the fight I just wish he could have had a childhood you know I wish I could have given them that him and Mari both you did the best you could Kate you kept this alive as long as you possibly could it counts for a lot I hope you know Javi having you there with me right by my side all this time that&amp;#39;s what made the difference you&amp;#39;re so sure of what you&amp;#39;re doing all this for you didn&amp;#39;t run away you could have I&amp;#39;m here so I can set an example for people for Gabe especially someone to be proud of someone who sticks around I get it there&amp;#39;s no graceful way to say this so I&amp;#39;m just going to say it I know we&amp;#39;ve had moments you and I and they&amp;#39;re always a little hot and a little confusing and maybe some of them haven&amp;#39;t meant anything at all but before whatever happens tomorrow happens I need you to know whatever this thing is between us I want to give it a chance and I know the fact that David is back in our lives now makes this whole thing a little more complicated but do you feel the same way I&amp;#39;d really like to know oh okay uh oh H like the problem is not that they like each other not a problem at all like not even remotely an issue especially since like he&amp;#39;s seems to be you know despite I don&amp;#39;t think being inherently a terrible person uh just pretty shitty in relationships and has especially been shitty to her right I think like I&amp;#39;ve said you know over and over again Step One is respectfully and responsibly ending things with David and and then step two is handling all her baggage and the healthiest way she possibly can to move past that incredible hump in that incredible situation so she&amp;#39;s healed and in a better place so she is available and ready for another extremely emotional and probably long-term relationship it&amp;#39;s not the problem that they like each other that&amp;#39;s not the issue the issue is the way that she&amp;#39;s going about it which is essentially like like hey I&amp;#39;m not going to address these things I&amp;#39;m just just let&amp;#39;s just do it just just [ __ ] it you know it&amp;#39;s Reckless it was Reckless you know time pass and thought he was dead yeah but like irregardless like now that like if if they had done this this dance like like I would say like even at this current time frame without knowing David was alive I don&amp;#39;t think at a certain point you just got to be like okay like homie was probably dead and there was no way we could have known right but now they do know which means that responsibility is on them right they do know what they would be doing would be wrong and causing a lot of harm and choosing to do so anyway is shitty right that&amp;#39;s a objectively shitty and not only is it shitty that&amp;#39;s not going to be healthy for them in the long term because essentially what they&amp;#39;re doing is they&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re you know making their relationship off the Bedrock and disgust of a different relationship right like they&amp;#39;re making their whole relationship based off of like hating and wanting to get away from David which is not a solid foundation they should really like each other they should really be there for each other and they have proved that a lot in the past like you know three years or however long that they&amp;#39;ve been on the road together that they can do that and they&amp;#39;re capable of that but like I don&amp;#39;t know I don&amp;#39;t know it&amp;#39;s just not it&amp;#39;s not a healthy way to go about things uh okay uh like I don&amp;#39;t know like this like this one of those things where like it like like if I was in this situation like me like I was in the situation I&amp;#39;d be like yes of course I like you of course you felt it and you know it but I want I like you enough I care about you enough that I want this to be forever&amp;#39;s EAS no takeback Seas this is I want this to be forever so in order to do that we got to make sure that this isn&amp;#39;t just built off the fact that like hey you just want to get away from David and then B you need to be healed up from all that baggage with the David thing that way we&amp;#39;re not trying to like heal through that while also trying to navigate the challenges of being in a new relationship together at the same time that baggage should be not it doesn&amp;#39;t have to be fully like completely dealt away with because something like that could go for like a long time but like for the most part you want to have most of that like you know squared away whole time yeah we can do that that way I can blame you if things go wrong I have a feeling what you guys are going to say do not tell her I&amp;#39;m going to grab a soda and use the restroom real quick and I&amp;#39;ll come back to see your answers right if a poll shows up the Paul just should have showed up on your screen uh if it didn&amp;#39;t you need to refresh and if you&amp;#39;re on mobile it&amp;#39;s in your channel Point words do we tell Kate that we want to be with her yes or no and I will use the restroom I&amp;#39;ll be right back e e e all right 40 St chat stri again so I have a feeling what we&amp;#39;re what we&amp;#39;re answering then God I hate that uh okay we&amp;#39;re tellinger uh okay hey I have a feeling she&amp;#39;s not going to go about this very healthily but yeah I have a funky feeling that she&amp;#39;s not going to go about this very healthily and it&amp;#39;s going to lead to some major major [ __ ] hey what the okay can you know I don&amp;#39;t even know if that&amp;#39;s true but like the fact I don&amp;#39;t know if that&amp;#39;s true but just the fact that you would do that is just like even as a joke it&amp;#39;s kind of like a dick move so [ __ ] you even that doesn&amp;#39;t end up being true like [ __ ] you that was a dick move not even funny all right so we&amp;#39;re telling her huh I&amp;#39;m telling you this isn&amp;#39;t going to go well like like I&amp;#39;m going to do it&amp;#39;s what we voted for but like in in in full disclosure like full and complete disclosure um I feel like she&amp;#39;s going to not handle this well so before things get crazy we might not get another chance let&amp;#39;s go for it we got to try right oh my god really really I hate this cuz this is how I sound so are we going to when I get [ __ ] all hopeful for love and [ __ ] and then I&amp;#39;m like I&amp;#39;m [ __ ] like in in the [ __ ] war zone getting [ __ ] destroyed later down the line I&amp;#39;ve been here and I know where it ends up we&amp;#39;re doing this you do realize we&amp;#39;re going to have to have a weird conversation with David right BR is rang true it&amp;#39;s the right way to play this he already got the sense I was pulling away that would be the standup thing to do in this situation can we should just say how lame doing the stand up thing is though yeah but like you we should have waited to like kiss and be together we should have we should have had the conversation first of them breaking up then her healing from the breakup and then and

would like to hear what you have to say happy to been waiting for this all day he really is Carlos TR not to disappoint you I do this all day I had a very interesting conversation with your friend Elanor last night isn&amp;#39;t that right holy [ __ ] we did oh my God she said you were coming here to Rally the people against me convince them that no good she turned completely don&amp;#39;t know how you thought you were going to pull it off considering it&amp;#39;s all of us against the three of you Elanor doesn&amp;#39;t know what she&amp;#39;s talking about she knew an awful lot of details about how you were going to pull it off elor&amp;#39;s a turn Co to sh especially after I promised her she could stay in Richmond that was so nice to her did that to us believe it here in Richmond people who put themselves before the group don&amp;#39;t last long bring them out get away from me you&amp;#39;re making a mistake aa oh no they had them this whole time David I miss a lot Jason I cannot explain it short handedly he told his people where to find our Gun Supply and trip too they picked us clean oh my God you really thought you could ride into town and Stage a coup with our own damn weapons something like that I can&amp;#39;t just let it go you&amp;#39;ve put me in a no win situation here so I&amp;#39;m going to do the same thing to you both of them deserve to die for their crimes however Javi I&amp;#39;ll let you spare one of them just one no jo don&amp;#39;t what the [ __ ] not after what they tried to do you may be guilty of bringing them into this but they chose to go along with it if you&amp;#39;re going to punish anyone it should be me not them so ready to sacrifice yourself for others don&amp;#39;t worry Javi I&amp;#39;m not through with you yet he evil Joan are you sure about this we never agreed to killing all these people it&amp;#39;s really of isn&amp;#39;t it all I ate your spinach brother I love your spinach help you make up your mind I ate your spinach man Remember come on Javi who&amp;#39;s it going to be your friend oh God what we actually we actually have to choose here oh no uh I don&amp;#39;t like that I don&amp;#39;t like this what the [ __ ] Ava I don&amp;#39;t know Ava&amp;#39;s been I don&amp;#39;t know that&amp;#39;s why it&amp;#39;s hard cuz like like I don&amp;#39;t know they&amp;#39;ve both been there for me so much you know Trip&amp;#39;s mad at me right now but like if I could explain things more to trip like I feel like he would come around to be like yeah [ __ ] I know Conrad was a good person but like he was got a [ __ ] ace [ __ ] like like my he was going to ace my nephew if I didn&amp;#39;t [ __ ] shoot him like what was I supposed to do there and he would come around because he&amp;#39;s a good person he would come around and AA has just been nothing but supportive the entire time when it has been not like like what it&amp;#39;s been the most difficult what it&amp;#39;s been the most difficult for her she&amp;#39;s always she is she is even not only to me but to CLM like back in the past like she she when it was you know she stole from her own group which is what got CLM kicked out in order to help CLM which was a huge [ __ ] risk and she did that for Clem like they&amp;#39;re both fundamentally good people that are just a little flawed emotionally you know like they just have some areas where they go R in their judgment ah [ __ ] I don&amp;#39;t want to even say anything cuz I know like I know if I say trip if I say trip they&amp;#39;re going to be like oh well you know you disagreed with me once and now you just wanted me have me killed it&amp;#39;s like that&amp;#39;s not what it is and I don&amp;#39;t want to pick AA cuz Ava&amp;#39;s been like like I said like AA when without any sort of personal connections and even when the personal connections get tough has been consistently there and and been a trooper I feel like jav would pick trip just based on the fact that like they&amp;#39;ve spent more time together and he hasn&amp;#39;t given up like he would not give up hope on you know their friendship and their you know um but like there&amp;#39;s no reason to really pick Ava here you know cuz like Ava&amp;#39;s just been doing well she&amp;#39;s just mixed up with the wrong people yeah she&amp;#39;s a good person just mixed up with the wrong people H take trip ah like hobbywood I know jav would I know Javier would he would he would pick trip here just cuz like like he doesn&amp;#39;t know AA very well aa&amp;#39;s been nothing but reliable this whole time but he doesn&amp;#39;t know AA very well like I feel like the emotional side would come out I may not go I&amp;#39;m curious I may not go with whatever decision you guys make but I do want to know and this will be a shorter poll I&amp;#39;ll ask who would you save this is this is this has been like even compared to to like season one these decisions are actually really tense I do not like them I haven&amp;#39;t we haven&amp;#39;t pull that much we only pulled like like one or two things in all of season one and then like basically nothing in season two besides like what uh the ending in this one I&amp;#39;m like I&amp;#39;m like pulling everything I&amp;#39;m like I&amp;#39;m like all this is Icky I don&amp;#39;t like it I don&amp;#39;t like any of this I don&amp;#39;t like any of this uh wow it&amp;#39;s even to oh God good Lord that&amp;#39;s so wild I don&amp;#39;t know I&amp;#39;m kind of leading trip right now just cuz like in a vacuum where like I don&amp;#39;t know the decision to make I I&amp;#39;m like thinking of like what would the character do and I definitely feel like um I definitely feel like he would go with like his friend here that he knows really well not the the girl he&amp;#39;s known for like a day and a half and it wouldn&amp;#39;t be a big like bad personal thing it&amp;#39;s just like you know it&amp;#39;s just like you know push comes to shove like you just answer here like we have we have the time to sit here and deliberate right because we&amp;#39;re we&amp;#39;re Outsiders just watching but like in a reality there would be no time to deliberate and we would just have to make a like a a snap decision and I feel like the snap decision would be trip and not at least for a hobby it would be trip and not AA which sucks you you guys have it even too which is the interesting part like you guys feel about the same way I do where it&amp;#39;s just like I feel like they&amp;#39;re both just good people and they&amp;#39;re just kind of like misguided on certain things and none of them deserve potentially being killed in any way shape or form I you imagine how Trip&amp;#39;s feeling right now too like he&amp;#39;s got betrayed by a girl that he&amp;#39;s been like in love with for a really long time like that&amp;#39;s got to [ __ ] suck dude like that dude&amp;#39;s got to be going through the [ __ ] feelings right now he&amp;#39;s got to he&amp;#39;s got to be like like 18 ways [ __ ] up he&amp;#39;s he&amp;#39;s got to be sad as [ __ ] right now he&amp;#39;s got to be like he&amp;#39;s got to he&amp;#39;s got to be in the dumps in the [ __ ] dumps so I&amp;#39;m think I&amp;#39;m going brother&amp;#39;s Lieutenant trip has to live He&amp;#39;s invaluable son of a [ __ ] jav what the [ __ ] is wrong with you you&amp;#39;re not making David happy but I respect you for sticking up for your own people shoot it wait I said trip should live you did but there&amp;#39;s something else you need to understand oh [ __ ] betrayal you can&amp;#39;t do this [ __ ] figures I can do anything I want you brought this on yourself do it wow she&amp;#39;s going crazy wait he didn&amp;#39;t deserve that oh my God they really shot him God damn it now David it&amp;#39;s your turn she&amp;#39;s on a power trip dude I can&amp;#39;t believe this this isn&amp;#39;t how we do things this is madness stoper Clint is this the process you trusted no think about this hob you know what&amp;#39;s going to happen here you ready for that we don&amp;#39;t murder enrichment we Exile that&amp;#39;s how we&amp;#39;ve always done things how about you take David and the rest of your people and just get the hell out go far away from Richmond and then whatever you do is up to you I&amp;#39;m sure the herd outside would like that she thinks she&amp;#39;s sending us out there to die she&amp;#39;s counting on it everybody put your guns away we&amp;#39;re going to handle this peacefully don&amp;#39;t listen to them Javi they&amp;#39;re [ __ ] butchers all of them shoot that [ __ ] take her out she deserves it God this season with the [ __ ] choices one after another one after another she God I hate it I well I love it I think it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s very gripping and very cool it&amp;#39;s very thematic but like I hate being in the driver&amp;#39;s seat of it I ain&amp;#39;t having to make these decisions hey Beast it&amp;#39;s good to see you bud hopefully you&amp;#39;re well yeah this is this is something Victor to the two but I&amp;#39;m chaos I mean like yeah I don&amp;#39;t know cuz like if we take this deal if we take this deal like she gets to just essentially just keep raiding settlements and being evil right like her evil does not stop regardless of what they end up doing with us for what we do we&amp;#39;re doing a service to like the the like we are doing a service to like people in general by getting her out of power so she can stop raing other settlements and killing other people willy-nilly so yeah if you don&amp;#39;t do it I [ __ ] will go to hell everyone remember that oh oh [ __ ] that&amp;#39;s actually not how that works you uh usually the next snap kills you not the not the actual strangulation of hanging just mebs so he would realistic unless they [ __ ] it up just like be dead here already [ __ ] machete lady about this isn&amp;#39;t like other like Choice

I can&amp;#39;t leave until I make this right no no no but we are making it right let&amp;#39;s fix this as best we can like we are making it right by making sure that the New Frontier isn&amp;#39;t out here killing and raiding other towns just to prop up one that&amp;#39;s such a big plot point it feels like all the characters really are just kind of like dancing around it to kind of like have that air of like moral grayness to everything like like this town is evil like not everybody inside the town is doing doing it but everybody who&amp;#39;s part of the governmental system certainly is like and it feels like every character is kind of just like ignoring this all right Kate let&amp;#39;s make things right whatever I don&amp;#39;t know if it&amp;#39;s actually possible but I feel a lot better knowing you&amp;#39;re there too like sure there&amp;#39;s like a bunch of survivors in this hallway but like you know how many families and people were murdered in neighboring settlements just so these people could even [ __ ] be here that Cycle&amp;#39;s got to stop and it&amp;#39;s going to be an ugly thing to stop that cycle it&amp;#39;s not sustainable and it&amp;#39;s happening at the death and and EXT extortion of so many other people was my best friend Jai he died because of you no he died because of [ __ ] you deserve this you have no one to blame but yourself your actions betrayed trip yep and to think of how much he cared about you [ __ ] tell I never thought it would be like this no nobody ever does you have to believe that selfish people don&amp;#39;t think about the way they Hur others everyone is dead everyone but me yeah and you helped with that what&amp;#39;s done is done mhm I don&amp;#39;t have to like it but I can&amp;#39;t change it but you

Gabe talked her down I&amp;#39;m sorry I didn&amp;#39;t mean to do that to you you know that why the hell you all looking at me that way they&amp;#39;re just they&amp;#39;re scared David of what I&amp;#39;m protecting them why are you pointing a gun at us you even realize so I&amp;#39;m all [Music] alone fine then you people are on your own such an [ __ ] I&amp;#39;ve seen that look in his eyes before you should go after him it&amp;#39;s kind of like what people thought Kenny was like at the end of uh season 2 but like Kenny wasn&amp;#39;t there yet he wasn&amp;#39;t he was he was approaching there but he wasn&amp;#39;t there yet I don&amp;#39;t think he was going to get there but that was kind of like what people were overreacting they thought he was going to end up like like this dude that actually makes sense this actually you know want the uh situation or the response what happened before didn&amp;#39;t so it&amp;#39;s just interesting to see that dichotomy between season uh two and three here just between those characters if this thing ever loads so hope your day is going well that just infinitely loads forever I hope in season 4 the this is not a thing this is the only this is the only season where it&amp;#39;s done this this is the only season where it&amp;#39;s done this season one and two are fine season season 3 is the only one that just keeps doing that [ __ ] over oh oh [ __ ] oh [ __ ] just jump holy [ __ ] that&amp;#39;s a long way down you&amp;#39;ll fall fast but you&amp;#39;ll fall all the same come over here or are you afraid of me too I know the rest of them are right I&amp;#39;m a lot more afraid of falling and I&amp;#39;m even more afraid of Landing there&amp;#39;s nothing to be afraid of it be over in an [Music] instant my wife javey my son son they look at me differently they&amp;#39;re a different person maybe you&amp;#39;re seeing them differently I want to show you something stand with me okay oh [ __ ] why the hell are you smiling see that sewer line over there perfect placement for a trench that Hill about 100 Paces west of it I see a lot of pngs of buildings sniper Wildest Dream Come True I&amp;#39;m a soldier hob I see this landscape like a painter sees a blank canvas like how you used to see a baseball diamond oh you got to go [ __ ] therapy I&amp;#39;m Soldier this makes sense to me right now I was made for this I thrived he said the thing just time ago I miss it so [ __ ] much when I wasn&amp;#39;t deployed I&amp;#39;d miss being out in the field now that&amp;#39;s all I am had push [ __ ] I got it from David in the middle of a completely different [ __ ] game Oh I thought I was safe today this is [ __ ] [ __ ] man this sucks I&amp;#39;m not playing DVD today what the [ __ ] is this I hate everything I Hae everything so [ __ ] much gosh not even playing the [ __ ] game today and I have to do mft [ __ ] pushups son [ __ ] ha it a soldier isn&amp;#39;t a husband or a father a soldier is a soldier nothing else nothing nothing at all call yourself whatever you want I still see you as my brother that is kind of you to say it sounds like he needs therapy like obviously can&amp;#39;t get that sometimes well maybe you can not all the therapist died I want to change Javi I always have yeah that&amp;#39;s right you need therapy Bud all you ever tried to do was get me to change projecting as wild that is only because I couldn&amp;#39;t bring myself to do it first it&amp;#39;s the one War I could never win yeah you this is healthy good I&amp;#39;m glad you finally admitted it I&amp;#39;m glad you finally admitted it so many people that don&amp;#39;t want to change project that there&amp;#39;s something wrong with every like not only like the close people life but people all around them because like it&amp;#39;s like the whole world doesn&amp;#39;t make sense to them and they can&amp;#39;t figure out why but the only thing that is the common denominator between all of those things is you right it&amp;#39;s like why why does my family not get along with me why does why does it seem like things keep going wrong at my life at at at between my friends at work in my relationships and nobody ever like people don&amp;#39;t like people will like spend their whole lives like angry and resentful at like everything like all around them and not get why life is just all against them and so many people never hit this point where they&amp;#39;re like maybe it&amp;#39;s me maybe I&amp;#39;m the problem that&amp;#39;s good that&amp;#39;s healthy glad he got there I get this is really good and I&amp;#39;m wondering why is it because I don&amp;#39;t know how no you just need professional help man or because it&amp;#39;s impossible to change who you no no you just need professional help we can support you there&amp;#39;s a way there always is you just need professional help a professional Handler you just have to keep looking until you find it looks pretty messy for now maybe you&amp;#39;re right maybe just got to live long enough to find out just like with anything else I did what you asked you did thanks for that so now will you step back sure I found them they&amp;#39;re up here David&amp;#39;s a really well wit character I&amp;#39;m very like pleasantly surprised by that she was still outside when we checked on the entrances there meros everywhere we got her di just in time too Happ I&amp;#39;ve never seen so many mertos it&amp;#39;s awful out there well this won&amp;#39;t be awkward whatsoever Ava about earlier I guess I owe you an explanation about what happened on the stage with Joan and trip you don&amp;#39;t have to say anything to me your actions said plenty I read you loud and clear but goad go ahead and say whatever you want hey don&amp;#39;t get mad at me it was a total no- win scenario true just be glad the situation was what it was and that she didn&amp;#39;t make me pick between you and your brother blame evil evil people for the things they do not the way the good people handle their reaction evil you don&amp;#39;t know the half of it the herd has taken over Richmond the streets are filled with Walkers with that hole

none of us do gab stabilize the city figure out how to make it safer for everyone I saw construction vehicles when we got the armored truck we can use those to stop the wos seal the bridge and save Richmond that&amp;#39;s over by the motorpool at the water tower we could use the highway overpass to get to the water tower come on let&amp;#39;s jump that would have been an ill time thing to say like three minutes ago come on is this how Ben died you&amp;#39;re doing [ __ ] like [Music] this go clim go keep your eyes open stay aware of your surroundings all of you let&amp;#39;s move out when

relies on other people to solve your problems because then you&amp;#39;re not a man at all no the strongest men surround themselves with like-minded good people who care about them because good men care about people the way they care about others that&amp;#39;s what a good not even a good man a good person does sur yourself with people that care about other people that&amp;#39;s what you do used

him to a better place good [ __ ] very well written seon I love this a lot not that beats the classic season one but like this is great like they thought about a lot about these characters and what&amp;#39;s going on in their heads and not any shows there&amp;#39;s barely any room and there&amp;#39;s a lot of characters there&amp;#39;s a lot they could have FL like blobbed any of them right they could have just fumbled one or the other no time to waste come on they&amp;#39;re all really fleshed out and a really good way they discard them two episodes yep that could scare me anymore and yet here we are just goes to show you oh my God oh my God oh my God life is full of I&amp;#39;m not just scared I&amp;#39;m [ __ ] terrified I would also be I also afraid of he up very little development yeah you hear the noise that came out of my mouth I don&amp;#39;t do Heights man you&amp;#39;ve got to be more careful it this oh my God no holy [ __ ] oh my God AA [ __ ] God damn it no I&amp;#39;m sorry man I know she was important to you I would have died a long time ago without her thank you aa oh [ __ ] she just got [ __ ] taken out did that come from I guess people can die at any moment holy [ __ ] we have to get across thank you just oh my God no that was that&amp;#39;s probably a funny clip in retrospect D thank you so much for the I know Gabe doesn&amp;#39;t see it but David really is trying to look out for him yeah he&amp;#39;s not doing the best job but no one gives you a rule book to raise a kid and they sure as [ __ ] don&amp;#39;t there&amp;#39;s just one thing I don&amp;#39;t get though did David really think he was helping AJ by letting him go why did he stop guarding him he was afraid holding a baby in his arms probably scared him 10 times more than any wor though I don&amp;#39;t understand after you do stupid [ __ ] when they&amp;#39;re scared so much of your heart AJ was a brat he lived with me after we kicked you out Clen I&amp;#39;d already raised two kids thought it&amp;#39;d be a piece of cake people did the stupidest [ __ ] when they&amp;#39;re scared not with that Tyrant is that why you gave him away we had a bad winter destroyed every crop we had I couldn&amp;#39;t leave Richmond and AJ couldn&amp;#39;t stay in Richmond I gave AJ to lingard and told him to do whatever he had to to save his life I missed that breath never ask lingard about it again though I wanted to I&amp;#39;ll bet the little brat misses you too both of you it wasn&amp;#39;t easy Glen remember far as I knew I&amp;#39;d already lost two children yeah he was number three it&amp;#39;s never easy I&amp;#39;m going to keep you alive keep all of us alive and hope that that&amp;#39;s enough enough for atonement he was a brat huh a goofy little brat you were trying to take care of him sometimes that&amp;#39;s not so easy he didn&amp;#39;t give up reminds me of someone who did the same thing for me mhm you did the right thing holy [ __ ] chopped right in half the hell happened here well it crashed could tell that do not seem safe like at all you&amp;#39;re not thinking it&amp;#39;s that or go back I hate that we should go lightest to heaviest that

tower me a zomie you die and you&amp;#39;re just oh this is a nice vibe that was kind of one of the stars true that&amp;#39;s what I think about like anytime like anybody mentions or like like the 90 show it&amp;#39;s like well somebody&amp;#39;s not [ __ ] here for a very [ __ ] bad and awful reason but on the flip side Ashton Kutcher is uh finding child trafficking so like you know there&amp;#39;s one of the those one of those people there&amp;#39;s even better reason to watch at least there&amp;#39;s that I guess don&amp;#39;t wipe your face with it you&amp;#39;ll make it worse you did it Javi barely now that we&amp;#39;re here we got to find something to seal the breach with all we need is the right vehicle that&amp;#39;s not going to do the job man yes it is what are you

leader by the way like one of the big four that was leading the entire like I guess City settlement I think settlement is the word that was one of the big four that was leading the entire settlement who&amp;#39;s just like yeah [ __ ] him they get to die what makes you better than the other chick who was like murdering other settlements just to prop them up them not after what we&amp;#39;ve done we&amp;#39;re going home Kate back to the last place we were a family we&amp;#39;re starting over we&amp;#39;re all together again finally it&amp;#39;s time no all of us a new day a new life

homie right there break a bit de off push-ups okay so really really funny yo far thank you so much for the follow I really appreciate that thank you very kind of you you know what&amp;#39;s funny uh we have a a new rule here that anytime like uh like people bring up made for this like the new perk this doesn&amp;#39;t count by the way I&amp;#39;m just referring to the count uh I have to do either 10 squats or 10 push-ups so I&amp;#39;ve been doing a lot of push-ups on on on stream lately and and they and they just very casually said like I&amp;#39;m made for this in one of the lines and I was like [ __ ] playing dead by daylight and I got [ __ ] do push-ups I was so [ __ ] mad I&amp;#39;m glad your stream was well though I&amp;#39;m glad you had a good time it seems your people are happy but uh yeah we were playing The Walking Dead uh season 3 and we are uh it was a really good season like season 3 was really really good really good also Ling you here thank you thank you I had a lot of like dead ends and stuff and um it was kind of like out of it was like all over the sword so I just cut like six inches off and stuff they&amp;#39;ll grow back they&amp;#39;ll grow back also it&amp;#39;s like it&amp;#39;s been it&amp;#39;s like the dog days right now it is hot it&amp;#39;s like in the &amp;#39;90s like every day so having a little bit less hair is a good thing it&amp;#39;ll it&amp;#39;ll grow back though I appreciate that though wow okay good people stepping up with David most people didn&amp;#39;t I&amp;#39;m clean about it wow that&amp;#39;s messed up only 63 sign of people should love for David the better wigli and should only protect the user instead of both I think I think made for this is like I I don&amp;#39;t think made for if made for this is going to get changed at all it just needs a timer I just needs a timer like off the record I don&amp;#39;t think it needs it&amp;#39;s exra changes at all I think it just needs a timer so it can expire to a certain point hang concert oo have fun djn thank you for trusting me your poo again have fun be safe have fun be safe be you you know most with Kate David Clementine team up with you wow a lot of people didn&amp;#39;t team up with oh a lot most people didn&amp;#39;t get CLM to team up with them o o that&amp;#39;s wild I could imagine Clement your Clementine became a graceful Gunslinger Clementine enjoyed brief Happy Days with Kenny and AJ ter change Liv Clementine has been able to drag leaving AJ on their own New Frontier clone showed hope and rce trusting in others but looking up for AJ first and foremost yeah when Javi and David fought at the L remembered a similar fight long ago she took control of the situation gun to D head stopping the V for escalated I think about that&amp;#39;s what I&amp;#39;m talking about the season was so well written like I didn&amp;#39;t even think about that like that must have been traumatizing as [ __ ] to watch cuz that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s what uh Kenny and uh what the [ __ ] what her name the [ __ ] biker jacket chick went through that&amp;#39;s almost the exact same thing I didn&amp;#39;t even think about that once David left in Jane that&amp;#39;s what it was yeah once David left in the truck with G she chose wow that&amp;#39;s crazy get him get him CL I think about that like they thought everything for this chapter that&amp;#39;s crazy or this this season like they really thought about like character mindsets motivations and like traumas and all that stuff and the way people heal and don&amp;#39;t heal from things like it&amp;#39;s like they really thought about everything I&amp;#39;m really impressed I really like this lot you need something for endurance and yeah well like I feel that&amp;#39;s a problem with we going to live forever and not with uh made for this you know what I&amp;#39;m saying like I feel like made for this would just uh I would just make we&amp;#39;re going to live forever a little better and not like analy made for this you know yeah cuz somebody&amp;#39;s brought it up now okay technically it&amp;#39;s not me so I guess I have to I&amp;#39;m gonna do squats this time I&amp;#39;m G done squats since this been a thing right because I can do squats too I I&amp;#39;ve been doing push-ups the whole time I feel like like in terms of like my body I feel like okay so like I played soccer for like a long time up until like Middle School um but like um in general like I feel like my legs are good like I&amp;#39;m happy with the way my legs look and I don&amp;#39;t feel like I need like I exercise them like I do 20 why why I no I no that&amp;#39;s [ __ ] I told you I [ __ ] told you I told you me just bringing up the fact that the counter exist does not count towards the counter I can talk about the counter without without somebody like without that Counting it was mentioned twice by two different people or the same [ __ ] person who else brought it up I know bman brought it up who else brought up made for this who did who else brought it up nickel one diing me for this [ __ ] why who else brought up we can&amp;#39;t do it every single time somebody brings it up every single [ __ ] instance I&amp;#39;m going to be like [ __ ] turbo buff by the end of this if you want me to do that I&amp;#39;m doing more [ __ ] like push-ups and sit-ups I can [ __ ] handle works like yeah it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s like it&amp;#39;s been brought up it&amp;#39;s not every time the [ __ ] word or perk is mentioned that would be [ __ ] insane yeah you can&amp;#39;t just like MF m m and make me like do a [ __ ] bajillion push-ups you can&amp;#39;t do that no don&amp;#39;t work that way wow okay the people spam it exactly we don&amp;#39;t want to make it abusable we get the Watermelons I could probably I didn&amp;#39;t actually try crushing some like a fruit I could probably already do like some smaller fruits to be honest like that&amp;#39;s what I&amp;#39;m saying is my my leg String&amp;#39;s like very good like in terms of my whole life like my life journey is just like a body type my leg strength has always been good my legs have always been great it&amp;#39;s my upper body that I up until recently didn&amp;#39;t actually start you know uh paying attention to and trying to treat uh correctly so like yeah so that&amp;#39;s like what I&amp;#39;ve been more focusing on like my workouts and stuff and I still I still do my leg stuff right like I still do my leg stuff like 100% I I I do not like because you know you don&amp;#39;t want to end up because what a lot of people do it&amp;#39;s like they they&amp;#39;ll do that exact thing they&amp;#39;ll be like okay I&amp;#39;m going to work on my body and I&amp;#39;m going to work on my legs because my legs are the thing I want to be good or or my chest of my my you know my biceps or whatever the [ __ ] and then they just like end up looking like drafts cuz like they&amp;#39;re all lower body is like still thin and the uh their upper body is not and it just looks [ __ ] awkward so like I&amp;#39;m not going to get into that trap but my leg but as I was saying my legs are usually pretty good are already pretty good so I don&amp;#39;t really need um I don&amp;#39;t really need that uh uh extra bit there I don&amp;#39;t need that extra extra stuff uh hold on let me I&amp;#39;m going to put up some uh music here I&amp;#39;m going to put it on the uh Spotify um thing got remember to take uh um walking because I&amp;#39;ll talk about how I feel about the season and all that stuff season there theme for or is it like okay it brought me up the actual like the actual Walking Dead Wi-Fi working tonight uh that I know what was happening uh with that so yeah can we just bring that back up yeah we&amp;#39;ll just bring up that song again that was in the credits it needs to be quieter though okay that&amp;#39;s fine right no hold on it&amp;#39;s still like slightly loud can you get quiet n CU I I don&amp;#39;t want it to be too loud all right that should be fine yeah I actually like really surprisingly liked this like a lot like I actually like obviously season one like like literally like compared to like like season one like season one oh I didn&amp;#39;t mean to close that oops I closed the music um yeah like season one will always be the goat right because that&amp;#39;s where we had Lee that&amp;#39;s where we had um like that&amp;#39;s where we had Lee that&amp;#39;s where we had uh you know we met Kenny and all like the like the characters that we care a lot a lot about you know so like that will always be the goat but this is really good this is almost on par with it most people hated it cuz Clementine because Clementine uh was not the protagonist I mean I thought I thought Javier was an excellent excellent protagonist the the the drama that he has with his family was like just like objectively interesting and I was like I was hooked the whole time how is he going to handle this weird like situationship that&amp;#39;s brewing with him and his brother&amp;#39;s wife how is he going to deal with his brother you know you know like the plot twist of even finding out his brother was still alive working through all that like that there were so many plot in this season that were really really good really really good and I I loved him I I I loved him so much like they were all fantastic um I was interested in in like Kate&amp;#39;s State of Mind Kate was a very very well fleshed out character and reacting very like sometimes disappointingly but very like naturally to like the events and stuff that was happening to her and in her um trauma and the situation that she was going through um I liked the kids like Gabe even though he got you know Gabe was never implausible like Gabe was obviously being like an angsty teenager a lot but like none of the things he&amp;#39;s feeling were like implausible or irrational they were all something that like even when he was being irrational it&amp;#39;s something you could reason believe like somebody his age would be saying or doing like he wasn&amp;#39;t like angsty or edgy for no reason like he he was just having teenage feelings right um I like to the group Jesus was cool Jesus was a very very cool like uh side character that I appreciated a lot I loved having him around um I liked how like there was more going on like the saes the stakes seemed bigger right cuz like we were talking about like it felt like I kind of had to do something about Joan and her and in the plot this season because like it wasn&amp;#39;t just like oh well if I don&amp;#39;t do this Kenny dies like that matters a lot to Clem but that doesn&amp;#39;t really matter much to like what&amp;#39;s you know the geographically to the area right like there&amp;#39;s no big Stakes here but like if we had not you know confronted and taken down Joan and like you know basically reformed uh the New Frontier entirely into something else like they would have continued to raid settlement after settlement after settlement right they would have continued to do the things that they were doing um and that&amp;#39;s like like we did good not only by like our own personal and like I guess would be like you know familial needs right like for like our friend friends and family but we did good by like the whole um we did good by like the whole like uh region right cuz now now nobody has to worry like anymore like they they&amp;#39;re we&amp;#39;re not going to be raiding other settlements and [ __ ] trying to be like you know and all that stuff like that&amp;#39;s just not something they&amp;#39;re going to have to worry about anymore so we did good for like the whole area which was like really really good so I liked that there was a like a bigger like a bigger plot going on and a bigger blowoff for all I liked that a lot like I really really appreciate that because of the communities uh which are from the comic series oh I didn&amp;#39;t know that did not know that yeah I don&amp;#39;t know I don&amp;#39;t know what else to say like even like David is like got almost kind of like in his own sense kind of like a like a sub antagonist like a side antagonist but he&amp;#39;s not like he&amp;#39;s not like an antagonist in the sense of like oh he&amp;#39;s just bad he&amp;#39;s not like Carver or anything like they it seemed like they try to like they tried to make him kind of like like like a Carver s character yeah he&amp;#39;s more like an anti-hero yeah but Carver I think was just too comically evil and too comically bad cuz like when you&amp;#39;re when you&amp;#39;re sitting there in season two and Bonnie is like no he&amp;#39;s a good person you just don&amp;#39;t get that he just kind of like he&amp;#39;s just doing his best like I don&amp;#39;t believe that for a [ __ ] second right like I like of course Carver is not a good [ __ ] person like why is Bonnie so [ __ ] stupid is what you say to that but like if if Bonnie was like if Bonnie was in the um the new frontier and she was saying that about David there&amp;#39;s actually that would actually make a lot of sense outway because I don&amp;#39;t think David is fundamentally a bad person I think he&amp;#39;s been severely traumatized and [ __ ] up by the things that happening whether that be the military or like his dad dying and it&amp;#39;s making him do bad things because he&amp;#39;s got a lot of trauma issues that he&amp;#39;s just completely unresolved and part of that is him outright refusing to solve and and you know Rectify his own issues he thinks he can just talk it mascul his way out of everything and it&amp;#39;s not working and it&amp;#39;s causing him to lose everything important in his life including his own life at the end right like he just didn&amp;#39;t get it um so like you know that&amp;#39;s a really well-written character though right cuz that&amp;#39;s how that&amp;#39;s how a lot of people end up you know going down dark paths that they don&amp;#39;t come back from it&amp;#39;s like just not you know not accepting you know that you know things are going poorly or not accepting that they need help you know um and just kind of stubbornly soldiering on when maybe they should do something that&amp;#39;s a very very human character it&amp;#39;s a very very human character um and the side characters were all really good trip was cool Elanor was like I did not see her betrayal coming and then like when she started explaining it I was like oh you&amp;#39;re you&amp;#39;re you&amp;#39;re selfish you&amp;#39;re a selfish person you never helped people in Prescott because like it was the right thing to do it&amp;#39;s cuz you liked being seen as a good person and now when you got to when you got to uh when you got to Richmond you&amp;#39;re like oh now I can be an even bigger good person like it was all about you the whole time and I&amp;#39;m like oh okay well that makes sense why you&amp;#39;d be you would and also why she would be unwilling to like resolve things with trip because it&amp;#39;s all about herself she&amp;#39;s selfish she&amp;#39;s a selfish person but even then that&amp;#39;s good writing right because like she&amp;#39;s very much presenting as a good person for most of the most most of the season and it kind of comes out at the end you&amp;#39;re like oh it was all self serving if you went with Gabe and David by yourself Gabe would live get a really good Destiny with David oh that&amp;#39;s disappointing I just didn&amp;#39;t want uh I didn&amp;#39;t want the homie to uh I I didn&amp;#39;t want uh I didn&amp;#39;t want Kate to go by herself to fight a entire zombie horde by herself I that would be shite I do not I think that would be a good idea I thought she would get get [ __ ] bonked you know and I was worried about that so I did not want that to be a thing yeah I did not want to get her to get bonked that was my worry I did not want something bad to happen but uh yeah that was that was my logic at least if K goes by should be b a turn so yeah that&amp;#39;s a really tough choice then yeah that is a really yeah I I I definitely made the right choice there it sucks that it results in Gabe dying because Gabe didn&amp;#39;t Gabe didn&amp;#39;t really deserve that I don&amp;#39;t think I don&amp;#39;t think Gabe just like Gabe like Gabe believed in his father that&amp;#39;s that was Gabe&amp;#39;s like like like Gabe believed in his dad and you know you know to be fair so so did so did uh like so did um so did hobby so did hobby I don&amp;#39;t know why I was like where that like I just froze there um yeah like so did Javi but like you know obviously for David Gabe was a soft spot so the fact that Dave still believed in him or Gabe still believed in him was like you know he didn&amp;#39;t do anything wrong he just believed in and loved his dad which is you know a sweet thing the one that seems to have the most people is send is to send clam after Gabe is that like the best ending as you split him up if CLM doesn&amp;#39;t decide to follow AI she&amp;#39;ll go with you or you don&amp;#39;t pick okay but like so is that like a a weird consequence of being too friendly and having too good of a relationship with with uh CLM like I like I kind of like that though I like that like a bad circumstance happens because I was too kind to someone that&amp;#39;s interesting that&amp;#39;s really interesting yeah did I build too good of a relationship boils down to Conrad like if I hadn&amp;#39;t defended her in that that by killing Conrad there interesting so like what I perceived to be kind of like an objectively good thing than to like keep and be kind and protect Clem ended up like being a bad thing later that&amp;#39;s interesting I like that because that&amp;#39;s like that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s real life right like sometimes like being too kind to someone and caring too much like sometimes people do weird stuff some people do weird things you know and it&amp;#39;s not always the best for everyone D can only live if both jav and Clen go after him but Kate dies yeah I don&amp;#39;t think that&amp;#39;s an equal trade especially considering like the um like the circumstances which is that like Gate&amp;#39;s trying to liberate the whole [ __ ] city the whole [ __ ] settlement right like I feel like it&amp;#39;s a you know I feel like it&amp;#39;s important that&amp;#39;s very very important yeah that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s funny because in season 2 it felt like I felt like like none of my choices mattered like most of my choices were non- choices and then this season three like it feels like all my choices matter which is how it should be I was very impressed like I like I I really love this a lot like like actually I mean that with an L with an L I love this I I love it almost as much as I did season one I love the characters I love the plot like there&amp;#39;s nothing contrived or weird or things I&amp;#39;m like like the only thing I kind of stuck out was like they clearly didn&amp;#39;t want Kenny in the story anymore so they killed him off kind of just like halfhazard but like I guess it makes like it makes sense because like anybody can die right like anybody can die anytime and that&amp;#39;s realistic for unfortunately right as much as you uh nobody would want that to happen it&amp;#39;s realistic right it&amp;#39;s realistic that that would happen even if it sucks so yeah and cl going that [Music] scenario let&amp;#39;s watch this real quick my watch party screen k where are you of wow they the the the defend series really turned up the uh like how good the game [Music] looked she&amp;#39;s like she yeah she she made it she made it all the way up and did that she still she still stopped more walkers from coming in that that&amp;#39;s crazy so even by herself she made it that far that&amp;#39;s crazy that kind of speaks to like the resilience of that character you know that even solo she made it that far&amp;#39;s beere she is just not in the way you want her that sucks I&amp;#39;m glad I didn&amp;#39;t have this happen cuz she&amp;#39;s the one that gave a [ __ ] about the people that lived here even David was going to cut and and run and David was one of the four leaders of the town she gave a [ __ ] up until the end more than the actual [ __ ] doctor did more than Elanor did I was just in it for herself oh it makes you actually click that&amp;#39;s [ __ ] that&amp;#39;s [ __ ] up are the graphics of this yeah it shows how much they really like cleaned it up for the definitive edition this cuz this looks kind of rough Definitive Edition is it&amp;#39;s beautiful very very beautiful I can see kind of like the the roughness of this what happened she going what no no Sheed to I have a question did if if that&amp;#39;s his mom why does he call her Kate I&amp;#39;ve noticed that the entire game and I I was expecting at the end like somewhere near the end they explain it like he had like some sort of like beef with her or something why does he call her Kate let&amp;#39;s hope that&amp;#39;s enough stepmom oh oh okay oh okay okay okay so so David had kids with another woman and then she married in later okay I missed that okay okay okay okay Goa so she she&amp;#39;s she&amp;#39;s not their by olical Mom that&amp;#39;s interesting okay okay okay yeah like interesting okay call by is name yeah okay yeah that makes sense I just didn&amp;#39;t I just I I like I I I guess I just like glossed over that like when I heard like stepmom I assumed she like I don&amp;#39;t know somewhere my brain like I guess they just didn&amp;#39;t really like they didn&amp;#39;t get too deep into it and they&amp;#39;re just kind of like here that&amp;#39;s the thing go it&amp;#39;s like I was like did she have one of them did she have both of them did she I she would have both of them because she wouldn&amp;#39;t be a step bom but did she have one of them and not the other or like what was the deal there you know I didn&amp;#39;t I didn&amp;#39;t I was waiting for it to get explained and it just like they never went further so yeah Poland says a lot about her morals true true but also she deserves better because she did that she deserves better because she did that so I feel like we did better by her uh by doing that um yeah that was really good though that was really really good and I I I thoroughly thoroughly enjoyed that now season 4 which is what we&amp;#39;re looking at for next week which which you know if it wins right like but it&amp;#39;s probably going to win let&amp;#39;s be real like um it it seems that we&amp;#39;re just kind of like you know going through all these this is like and that&amp;#39;s fine 1 million th% fine especially after this week where like I was blown away by this I loved this a lot and I was very very very very happy to be um very very happy to uh like play this and if season four is on part with season one I already think season 3 I already think season 3 is on part of with season one it w be real not not fully it&amp;#39;s like close second but I thought the writing was incredible like I was sitting here cycle analyzing characters like Midway I haven&amp;#39;t done that since season one you know what I&amp;#39;m saying I was S I was sitting here going like like wow that actually makes sense based on this person&amp;#39;s trauma and what they&amp;#39;ve been through and hey that&amp;#39;s unhealthy or that hey that&amp;#39;s healthy you know like that [ __ ] was cool and I and I miss doing that and I miss having the characters having so much depth so if season 4 season 4 is even better like season 4 is going to be like bring even more of that cool stuff even more of that like o I can wait I cannot wait I I I I really hope that that wins uh next week it was funny cuz like I didn&amp;#39;t even think we were going to be doing um I didn&amp;#39;t think we&amp;#39;re going to be doing season 3 uh this week because uh it made it the adventure was ahead with like four votes for like the first three days and then it like turned around pretty quickly only has four episodes oh so it&amp;#39;s shorter in terante in terante we could probably speed depending how long the episodes are we could probably do it all in one night like we did this one yeah I I I thoroughly enjoyed this I I&amp;#39;m very happy I&amp;#39;m very happy and I I&amp;#39;m glad because like I&amp;#39;m glad because like season 2 was kind of a let down it was kind of meh so I&amp;#39;m happy that they were for TR to form able to watch your vods from the previous Seasons yeah so like if you go into my if you go into into my my highlights I highlight everything so everything&amp;#39;s voted So like um yeah everything&amp;#39;s a highlight so you can go back into my twitch page um and it&amp;#39;ll say like Walking Dead season 2 episodes 1 through 3 and it&amp;#39;ll like you know and it has the whole vot highlighted so yeah you can go back through there cuz naturally they disappear uh I think it&amp;#39;s two weeks that things stay up but uh because for important stuff like like let&amp;#39;s plays like this that we do on The Saturdays I highlight everything so uh yeah all that&amp;#39;s up uh I have thought about doing that I have thought about doing like I used I actually did used to upload certain things to the YouTube like way back in the day back when I was first getting my YouTube like my feet under me for like my YouTube stuff I did used to upload like the stuff we did on the Saturdays but like it was like like for example like for example I&amp;#39;m going to pull up uh I&amp;#39;m going to pull up like my latest video which is a react to uh a mid skull video uh this has 662 views my like let&amp;#39;s plays that I would do that I would like upload here don&amp;#39;t talk yeah this one a year later only has 60 see blood wash amazing amazing game 86 murder house one of the best indie horror games that I have ever played 88 you know like people just don&amp;#39;t care like I I tried to make that a thing and I really wanted it to be a thing but like people just didn&amp;#39;t care which is fine you know like I said I still have you still have access to it through my twitch uh highlights but like when I tried to put that up on the YouTube just like nobody really cared so they&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re just here to hear me rant about dbd for the most part whether that be through a react to somebody else&amp;#39;s video or like my own video people are just there to watch me complain for it appears so um yeah uh but yeah that is going to be uh it for today friends uh I would watch them but bust over DVD vids yeah that&amp;#39;s essentially it it&amp;#39;s like nobody cares like they just like if you&amp;#39;re here like if you&amp;#39;re here on the twitch you&amp;#39;re here to watch me do a bunch of other things like the indie horror games and the Saturday let&amp;#39;s plays but like the people on YouTube just want something to watch over dinner they want just want to hear somebody whine about DVD on a car ride home or something like that like it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s a different vibe it&amp;#39;s definitely a different vibe uh and that&amp;#39;s what I&amp;#39;ve been trying to like figure out for a while because like if I ever decide to not do dbd for some reason or like DVD dies for some reason like YouTube my YouTube channel is like all only dbd so that&amp;#39;s Oh weird um my twitch is Diversified enough that if something happened to DVD I could just like ship gears and do something else not so much with the YouTube so but that&amp;#39;s for me to figure out and worry about not you the characters from season 3 don&amp;#39;t appear all in season 4 [ __ ] [ __ ] I hate that because they were good characters I like them a lot I like them a lot I like them a lot that makes me sad are we going somewhere yes yes we are so um like I said or what I was about to say um thank you so much for hanging out guys this is a really really fun let&amp;#39;s play and I really appreciate you guys you know weighing in with your polls and such it

God for touch I think it&amp;#39;s breaking my heart think about it I&amp;#39;m small amount I don&amp;#39;t know I mean it&amp;#39;s proba a lot of time it&amp;#39;s just better to uh use melee to conserve on ammo anyways and save the Weaponry like the guns and stuff for uh boss fights it&amp;#39;s a 102 that&amp;#39;s on the other side I use doors cuz I&amp;#39;m cool whenever I open the save menu my cursor delocks is kind of weird don&amp;#39;t that was the thing last time I just didn&amp;#39;t notice it or what the deal was so one of two is too right we&amp;#39;ve already been in one of two was that just the hint to go come here to find stuff cuz I already been here yeah maybe three shots was there like three to four in the original twoo isn&amp;#39;t that like consistent I feel like I remember that there&amp;#39;s nothing at 102 we do have the second floor key now yeah I feel like I remember that where&amp;#39;s the staircase I think I walked by it we briskly jogged by it as the case may be here it is all righty don&amp;#39;t like this oh hi buddy that&amp;#39;s where this part happens Hi friend he you uh you enjoy doing your thing over there I&amp;#39;m going to walk in here so wait so we don&amp;#39;t have to do the I thought original you had to like was there like a soda pack or something jamming it and you had to like like force it out I love this song this is also one of my favorite tracks the original it&amp;#39;s just so moody and scary no still do okay that&amp;#39;s why I do remember that correctly have go crazy I yeah I would res evil I love so much in a different spot okay I was like I remember that I love this track so much it&amp;#39;s so cool very moody a memory a time I tried so hard and got so far but in the end it didn&amp;#39;t a mattress I had to fall to lose it all where am I now oh okay weit up somewhere else renovation works it&amp;#39;s has to keep out the floor of the building okay okay I love the Silent Hill too is uh up to the spirit of the original with the the door jam simulator door jammed door jam door jam simulator door jammed can&amp;#39;t go in there door jammed in strictly contemporary terms we refer to that as the illusion of content this is a big apartment building with a lot of rooms but realistically what can you actually do in here a minimal amount a gun how do I get my board back out I know there&amp;#39;s a cool thing that uh with these two items that I won&amp;#39;t spoil in case I [ __ ] up realistically if I [ __ ] up it won&amp;#39;t be a thing but I wonder if those change as like the plot happens or do I have to like can I cuz I want to use my woodboard until I have to find a boss oh there we go I have to press e e is the key to do that do the DVD jokes symbolism probably not don&amp;#39;t think about it okay all right so huh what what do you mean this is America I do like this one oh it&amp;#39;s this part this part I like how some of the songs are done but the other songs they&amp;#39;ve just left as is you fult which is right here oh he&amp;#39;s gone never did end up using the restroom and the true Silent Hill was inside of us all along that&amp;#39;s what I Lear oh you can go out there this one&amp;#39;s not going to like collab something yeah I was actually a huge lost fan never got super into that show okay cool I can be out here but step one I can go out here step two what oh okay I see over here what&amp;#39;s say are you down there or are you close oh [ __ ] hi not the fridge bro your shit&amp;#39;ll spoil this is probably going to be the next part of this all I would have looked at that there can I turn this around um um it&amp;#39;s not letting me turn these anymore um hello yeah cuz the other one had something on the back of it which is why I wanted to turn this one over but I can&amp;#39;t turn this one over either it&amp;#39;s just not letting me do the the turnaround motion I&amp;#39;m usually able to do game broken I do know that like be night were talking about how like the game&amp;#39;s kind of buggy I guess I&amp;#39;m seeing more of that hello I probably need whatever numbers on the back of that they in the whole monitor that&amp;#39;s a thought as I can zoom right click puts it away left click does nothing usually in I was able to just move my mouse like my camera and it would flip that&amp;#39;s not oh q and E it switched to q and E for some reason interesting I used to be able to move my mouse that&amp;#39;s just okay okay okay buddy okay whatever you say okay so it&amp;#39;s Q ande now to do that I don&amp;#39;t know why that changed but next time I Dragon Ball Z hello oh hi how are you yeah item so because even though okay so that didn&amp;#39;t work the same way cuz previously even though it was like also a photo it&amp;#39;s not a key item so key items have a different control scheme okay okay so it&amp;#39;s not a bug it&amp;#39;s just a design Choice a little duus hey buddy oh [ __ ] I took it I kind of knew I should have uh dodged there but I just didn&amp;#39;t for some reason I was just kind of like no I can just tank it I just keep mashing on him hey can you get back here [ __ ] welcome home thank you oh oh [ __ ] know there&amp;#39;s another guy in here why am I being greedy all of a sudden bro GR chill chill stop [ __ ] just wailing on him and pay the [ __ ] attention skill issue honestly like I&amp;#39;m just being a dumbass yeah I took way more damage than I should have there that was just me being stupid I don&amp;#39;t know why I just randomly was like I&amp;#39;m going to wail on him oh it&amp;#39;s like a shortcut now want a taco yes please good good good see where are we now does it realisticly take us anywhere hard shell hard shell hav I already been here yeah I have oh that&amp;#39;s right cuz this is where this is you what&amp;#39;s really good there&amp;#39;s like Dorito taco shells those are good here we are back back to the lobby I was having such a good like like a run with the combat and then I just like got lazy and just [ __ ] it that it matters too much just Heck on me Heck on you Heck on your family Heck on your cow yeah back on my family get your taco back no oh I have cover you said taco and then you said talk no took it away think maybe like think combat&amp;#39;s going to go slightly harder cuz this game&amp;#39;s going to be expecting me to use my gun I&amp;#39;m just not going to and it&amp;#39;s going to be rough okay yeah I know I&amp;#39;m so funny I&amp;#39;m very fun funny looking hey uh I was going to I was going to make a make a make a bit out of that but you just like popped up [ __ ] relax oh that was just like a threatened display oh did you just dodge me it dodged back it also has a Dodge that&amp;#39;s crazy yo wise it&amp;#39;s been forever friend how the hell are you haven&amp;#39;t been on Twitch lately but I love to support a creator with a prime sub so I&amp;#39;m back also what do you think of languid touch on Zeno since Zeno calling doesn&amp;#39;t scarecrows very good spies and languid have extra good Synergy with the zor excellent choices I was actually using spies on our last game that we played for zor today uh it&amp;#39;s really nice because uh you get more you know Crow disturbances on the survivors end because you don&amp;#39;t disturb them yourself unless you literally step on them so yeah they&amp;#39;re great great picks although genetic limits is also nice than zorf and kind of fills a similar role to languid Touch without being as inconsistent so just keep that in mind but are there other people here this that&amp;#39;s a very long that&amp;#39;s a there&amp;#39;s a very long answer to that question which the game kind of sort of gets into but also does so I don&amp;#39;t know how much I should get into it um essentially Silent Hill if you played the first game which is a very very old PS1 game that quite frankly like needs the Remake really badly cuz it is actually in a not a very playable State um a long time ago um there was a cult that lived in this town and then um they uh were trying to bring about the birth of kunuk God which is not actually God it&amp;#39;s like some some crazy demon thing um but to do so they uh tortured this little girl called Alessa Gesa gaspie which is actually my uh favorite character in the sil Hill series and she kind of blew up not really not actually she didn&amp;#39;t blow up like explosion but uh her powers that she had like were Unleashed and created this kind of like pseudo Purgatory over the land of of Silent Hill and as a result um the fog and the power of the town quotequote um like reflects your greatest fears back at you or torments or traumas so it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s pretty complicated it&amp;#39;s pretty cool story but essentially the tldr is like it&amp;#39;s a creepy town that like prays on you and your deepest psychological psychological fears and regrets and whatever it happens to be and it&amp;#39;s different for everybody like uh in Silent Hill one most of the enemies are like like deform birds and dogs and bugs because you know what would what cuz Alessa was like 12 13 when she she got tortured by the cult so like what what would like a little girl be scared of realistically big dog you know scary uh scary bird you know like two before one cuz two is the best game two is the best game in this series so they wanted to make the one that would make the most money you think I&amp;#39;m cruel but this prison is on your own making this Choice was yours I watched you make it over and over again this time it&amp;#39;s not going to be a different I&amp;#39;ll be your watching oh [ __ ] [ __ ] is this Jesse what the [ __ ] are we talking about dude I love this noise that it makes the hell is this I just did all this just for whatever the [ __ ] going on in here somehow I feel further away progressing than before see what do I have so we have a partial code not quite sure what we do next I remember when I played the hospital level of the original Silent Hill 2 I just missed a tiny item in a tiny corner at the very beginning of the of the hospital and I I&amp;#39;m spending like 5 hours there because I just like genuinely could not figure out like what I was supposed to be doing it was cuz I cuz like there was so many like you know how like they&amp;#39;ll like you know I&amp;#39;ll walk over here and there&amp;#39;s that like this little prompt here to interact um there was like three of those in a tiny corner and uh I only got two of them and I assume because there were three in a tiny Corner that I already gotten all of them and that was not the case um let me go back save real quick so I end up playing the hospital level for like 5 hours wondering what the [ __ ] was going on on and then I just decided out of like resonation to go back through every single room and comb every single inch until I was like oh [ __ ] there was a third prompt in this room [ __ ] me and it just suddenly everything else fell into place okay I&amp;#39;m going to try to finally use the restroom my roommate was in there the last two times I tried I&amp;#39;m going to going to try to see if that&amp;#39;s the thing for for you&amp;#39;re back finally okay unfortunately I don&amp;#39;t really know where to go right now um we know that the coin is at the bottom of the shoot but I need to knock something out of the shoot right stuck on the key bed for an hour that sounds like pain but that sounds about right that&amp;#39;s a pretty convoluted level yeah cuz we need to wedge this free but we&amp;#39;re not at that yet I don&amp;#39;t know what that weird room is about the weird like peaco room I don&amp;#39;t know what the whole deal with that is like I don&amp;#39;t I&amp;#39;m not quite sure what to do with that so it feels like everything that we do from this point on is kind of like focused around that it seems very important but there&amp;#39;s like nothing to do there you just look and that&amp;#39;s it written in there there&amp;#39;s writing everywhere it&amp;#39;s all gbly good really make much sense of it there&amp;#39;s this thing over here but like can&amp;#39;t interact with it at all and on the other side of that we don&amp;#39;t have access to that yet and anything in red is a block so we actually have no Pathway to to like 206 or 204 right now on the map there&amp;#39;s a circle on two1 don&amp;#39;t know remember what the circles mean though question and Mark in 206 that&amp;#39;s the uh that&amp;#39;s the room we&amp;#39;re looking into the the weird room with all the writing that&amp;#39;s the room we&amp;#39;re looking into I guess I treat it like we were just talking about it like [ __ ] like uh just talking about the hospital something you need to do what we do have what this room that&amp;#39;s blocked off the only way through here is through here that&amp;#39;s right we need uh like some bolt cutters or some [ __ ] where we found the gun I still not fired a single shot of either that go way yeah that&amp;#39;s how that&amp;#39;s what led us into this area um cuz we didn&amp;#39;t have access to this part of the second floor you think I could just unlock that from this side the fact I have to go around every time is kind of annoying what do I have to do down here I need a key for it I do not have a key I have no idea what we need to do or where we need to go like at all those doors are open now it&amp;#39;s kind of what I&amp;#39;m just like [ __ ] around for tried shooting the lock no but I kind of don&amp;#39;t want to waste ammo if it&amp;#39;s not going to work can I just save and like one around hav would I not technically progress the gam since that point I mean it wouldn&amp;#39;t be bad it just like save coming I guess in survival horror games you got kind of got to like right it does not work [ __ ] me man oh q and E is to switch between the floors I see oh cool that&amp;#39;s neat I didn&amp;#39;t know that I just fat fingered that by accident and learned something new you call room no I tried looking around like it l all you can do is peek into that room and that&amp;#39;s it I know what looking I&amp;#39;m just looking for anything anything that jump out to me everything in that room I did there was that little side thing on the wall but it had no prompt nice accur accur how&amp;#39;s it going friend yeah I didn&amp;#39;t have a prompt so there&amp;#39;s nothing to interact with with that how do I get around this oh yeah I around yeah it&amp;#39;s like the one thing it&amp;#39;s like not H is great puzzles are kind of like hit or miss cuz it&amp;#39;s like all like some puzzles are fun cuz they actually take like thought to figure out and other times it&amp;#39;s just like oh you just missed the tiny McGuffin so now you just have to get stuck for like 15 hours because you walked bu something we were just talking about that funly enough we were just talking about that with the hospital section I walked by some a singular prompt and got stuck there for 5 hours cuz I [ __ ] missed a prompt just barely which is [ __ ] unreal that something that small can like brick your process oh I see Yep this is exactly the same [ __ ] thing this is literally the exact same [ __ ] thing I walked in this corner like four [ __ ] times no prompt I even stood like at this like side of it no prompt so I was wandering around for like what like 20 minutes because I stood here looked at this didn&amp;#39;t get prompt so I assumed nothing was happening and it wasn&amp;#39;t cuz I didn&amp;#39;t know what to do it was just the prompt didn&amp;#39;t show up that&amp;#39;s [ __ ] cool and this is where seven or four seven then we don&amp;#39;t know the last one I haven&amp;#39;t had to work as safe until since I was a McDonald&amp;#39;s manager unless they&amp;#39;re out of order like it&amp;#39;s 74 and something else CU technically realistically don&amp;#39;t you only need the two opening your hey spooky how&amp;#39;s it going I guess we need that there&amp;#39;s another one no I think that was our room number sour cream cheese brownies or sour some cream cheese sour cream cheese what the heck what is this dark magic you have summoned something is shuffling behind me love the intro thank you people still argued on it the same regards to the funny intro but it was funny at least right where the rooftops pierced through the night right where the rooftops pierced the night left are homebound Footprints with no one in sight but he has found home all police spray tow or her memories right there this hell that&amp;#39;s really insightful that&amp;#39;s really cool uh that tells me basically nothing yes sing Brown is down [ __ ] disgusting what the where not have what I need for this I need like a third photo oh you have to attempt okay you don&amp;#39;t just okay well that&amp;#39;s scary cuz I have no idea what the final number is that&amp;#39;s concerning technically you could reforce this but it&amp;#39;d be awful Huck so we finally get into this room and we&amp;#39;re like okay there&amp;#39;s a safe but we don&amp;#39;t have the full combination so we no closer than we were before so that&amp;#39;s cool I um like this puzzle I it&amp;#39;s not really a puzzle it&amp;#39;s just a McGuffin find the McGuffin to go find the McGuffin to grab the other McGuffin it&amp;#39;s not like it&amp;#39;s not actually a puzzle find the thing to go find the thing to find the thing see [ __ ] hell dude oh I&amp;#39;m stuck in here until I figure it out oh joy that makes me think it&amp;#39;s not cuz there&amp;#39;s no way they would softlock you it has to be that stupid puzzle then it has to be the riddle then not like the numbers we&amp;#39;ve had before so it&amp;#39;s uh right right where rooftops okay I guess I just don&amp;#39;t need this anymore right where the rooftops pierce the night through the night rooftop Spears to the night the [ __ ] does that mean left our homebound Footprints with no owner in sight yes found home oh please pray tell the river of memories lead right to this hell I&amp;#39;m going to take a picture of this okay okay so we don&amp;#39;t actually [ __ ] use any of the numbers that we have found so far for anything it&amp;#39;s a self-contained puzzle okay so this is telling us the direction right left but the whole foot rooftops pierced through the night homebound Footprints no owner inside like in the F he has found home these pre toel or a river of memories I don&amp;#39;t that last part gets kind of murky I was thinking like maybe like with what it says here I I&amp;#39;ll leave it on it with what it says like like the third floor is like rooftop access right um left our homebound Footprints with no owner sight I don&amp;#39;t know what that means cuz there&amp;#39;s cuz people live on the second and first floor and the third floor technically so homebound Footprints with no owner in sight I don&amp;#39;t know what that means like at all um but has he has he found home oh please pray tell or river memories lead right to this hell would that mean that last one leads here would that be second floor so two 312 if it&amp;#39;s not about the floors then I don&amp;#39;t know nope oh I have no idea then n yeah that I have no no idea then yeah yeah cuz there&amp;#39;s no like numbers associated with this right cuz like the only thing I think that was like number Association is like like the rooftops Fierce the night so the highest floor is three look around is there something else here cuz there&amp;#39;s no other prompts like at all there&amp;#39;s no other prom so like okay here&amp;#39;s this so out of all this garble G there is Tiny garble GS that matter but most don&amp;#39;t that&amp;#39;s kind of that&amp;#39;s sloppy you like that but it&amp;#39;s sloppy I actually don&amp;#39;t like this is this a number the [Music] rooftops cuz like it&amp;#39;s all like this is okay down here River 11 yeah this okay this is just like searching through a needle and a Hy stack okay 13 okay 13 7eleven 7-Eleven I love 7-Eleven I&amp;#39;ve never actually been to a 7 in my life coin Man coin man and a key to something steel key about to get me out of here there we go yeah I it&amp;#39;s like a cool idea but just with like how sloppy everything like how all the stuff&amp;#39;s just scribbled everywhere trying to find like like which parts matter and which didn&amp;#39;t was kind of like annoying FG I hear you where are you there&amp;#39;s another one hi buddy be find your dead small staircase t t key I feel like it&amp;#39;s just like the way they designed the puzzle it kind of has to be that way too it&amp;#39;s kind of like the the sad part because like like either like it&amp;#39;s too clear and it&amp;#39;s an easy puzzle or it&amp;#39;s like it was for me where it&amp;#39;s like okay this is kind of giving me a headache to look at this all just seems pointless so but it wasn&amp;#39;t pointless I didn&amp;#39;t think I&amp;#39;d be stuck in apartments for this long there&amp;#39;s the other way right yeah did you guys see that the guy&amp;#39;s standing up and then just saw me plop back down yeah we have the coin for [Music] okay we need to get more of these that&amp;#39;s in there so we don&amp;#39;t have to worry about that anymore glasses back on so second floor small staircase key moner case where are you at oh okay the padlock my Resident Evil ass brain&amp;#39;s like oh I got to get uh something to break that but I guess you could just unlock it hey there&amp;#39;s nobody here before what she doing oh the whole thing olved that&amp;#39;s crazy I remember the save point I remember this big here that&amp;#39;s funny okay this should allow us to get on the first floor from the other side cuz we don&amp;#39;t have access to the first floor apartments from this initially I said it ke [ __ ] apparently I hate that addon acidic key bro terrible choice nice there you go what kind unlocked sounds a good time well somebody&amp;#39;s having an even worse time sorry just a second looting the place I&amp;#39;ll be right with you hey who&amp;#39;s there it wasn&amp;#39;t me I didn&amp;#39;t do it I didn&amp;#39;t do it I swear where hey are you okay I didn&amp;#39;t do anything he was like that when I got here he Oh you mean the man back there in the kitchen I didn&amp;#39;t do it I swear I didn&amp;#39;t kill him it&amp;#39;s all right I&amp;#39;m not saying that you did my name is James James Sunderland um Eddie Eddie okay so uh do you live here Eddie no I&amp;#39;m not even from this town it&amp;#39;s just something brought you here yeah yeah you could say that I well they came at me I didn&amp;#39;t know what to do so I ran I came here figured it might be safe but but then I found the guy in the fridge easy deep breaths this place it&amp;#39;s not safe these things this whole town there&amp;#39;s something wrong with it might be best if you just get out of here yeah yeah you&amp;#39;re righty you want to come with maybe together we can find a way out of this town sorry but I can&amp;#39;t leave not yet I I need to find someone he&amp;#39;s so sad he&amp;#39;s like oh and Eddie be careful yeah you too just leave him to it pyramed thing is that cuz I didn&amp;#39;t approach the thing or is that just not in this game not the Remake doesn&amp;#39;t say it pange I remember this [ __ ] out here it was ass what okay whatever usually I they I got it down to like it&amp;#39;s two hits and then they like come after you but that guy just randomly interrupted it he was just like no one hit I&amp;#39;m good be careful about engaging he&amp;#39;s a little close yes anybody else out here I know there&amp;#39;s these guys down here but that&amp;#39;s a that&amp;#39;s a whole mess and a half might waste some ammo on them I would prefer not to but like that&amp;#39;s just a messy situation with three of them let&amp;#39;s ask him to get [ __ ] [ __ ] on do you think so speed you find out well the game doesn&amp;#39;t directly tell you but as you continue to learn about uh the town James people in it it&amp;#39;s it becomes apparent what&amp;#39;s happening I&amp;#39;m going to pull party yeah baby car yeah okay here the stairs I was like where are the stairs I&amp;#39;m trying to like aggro one of them and maybe okay all right come on come on come on oh [ __ ] they all got aggroed anyway [ __ ] me hold on maybe we can lead them out into a more advantageous area I mean even fighting like two in a even moderately tightly enclosed area could be a pain brother you not if I&amp;#39;m careful I should be able to do this it&amp;#39;s just going to be really stressful little C around the rosie with the peanut gallery over here looping by okay this guy is by himself un fairly injured already that&amp;#39;s huge oh my God God you like locked on that was too close oh [ __ ] oh [ __ ] hi buddy did he just not actually PUK he was just like H I don&amp;#39;t feel like it anymore I don&amp;#39;t feel like being gross like that [ __ ] I don&amp;#39;t know why they just randomly break the cycle like that that&amp;#39;s crazy I know I don&amp;#39;t need to like as long as I&amp;#39;m not below half health I should be fine but like for the thing but like it still makes me anxious just having any damage at all don&amp;#39;t like it is that you in the thumb video Yeah snake I don&amp;#39;t like like sneaks got SL d i sure dud oh you can just hop up here interesting anything else around here I remember that part being kind of a troubling in the original as well SES on a planing is like my worst nightmare like lit taking my two phobias and mashing them together inside Apartments open for. to 7 P.M outside does hours requested assistance at reception a door I came out of planes on snakes that&amp;#39;s all oh it&amp;#39;s this door okay get a discount I wouldn&amp;#39;t want to live here I&amp;#39;ve lived in a not great place not great part of town before but I would not I would not live here I wouldn&amp;#39;t mess with this stuff okay so we have the snake thing they pay you to live here I&amp;#39;m down Purgatory raids that&amp;#39;s not good I&amp;#39;ll just put it in for now cuz we we need three coins anyways to even do that so we need that one we need the one in the shoot that&amp;#39;s like our next step the shoot gosh we need something to to Lodge that or to get that unlodge cuz the trash Sho is blocked from the bottom so I need to find a way to dis Lodge it so I can get the coin that&amp;#39;s at the bottom of the shoot you feeling Pig shap no be funny though door jam G that needs a key oh that&amp;#39;s lovely nothing says cozing inviting like creepy hole in the wall oh [ __ ] hi where are you going okay goodbye oh what the [ __ ] whoa was there another one was there two in this room CU she left what the [ __ ] she didn&amp;#39;t make any noise when she reappeared either that&amp;#39;s the crazy part okay teleporting manans good to know that&amp;#39;s why I didn&amp;#39;t react at all cuz like she like ran away then just without noise no there are two there are two okay what the [ __ ] I feel like I get that they&amp;#39;re supposed to be like creepy crawly scary but like why was I not able to hear her just appear there that&amp;#39;s really [ __ ] weird I feel like I took a lot of damage there that like I didn&amp;#39;t deserve cuz like it just like I don&amp;#39;t know I should have heard that one coming and it just made zero noise I don&amp;#39;t mean on the like the radio either like literally like homie just uped on me okay hi Bru how are you brother I&amp;#39;m a level of 1 to 10 10 being excited and one being depressed I&amp;#39;m at like a 39 TOA with you brother yeah like H didn&amp;#39;t make a noise like they just kind of like appeared very interesting I do like these things Dodge back it&amp;#39;s kind of exciting yeah it&amp;#39;s a torso and a torso just the legs just just together he should just chilling there n here though play to hardcore yeah they they [ __ ] you up if you&amp;#39;re not careful oh I dodged I was L mid do I&amp;#39;m um what they have a grab move since when this is kind of annoying I because I&amp;#39;m autoed on the other guy I can&amp;#39;t Dodge this one that&amp;#39;s crazy it&amp;#39;s kind of sad too cuz like the combat so far has felt really good honestly that felt clunky as [ __ ] because I literally couldn&amp;#39;t like I couldn&amp;#39;t get out of the way of the one CU it auto locked me to the other one so I was just dodging away from the one that I was locked on to and not the one that was currently attacking me so I was just dodging into the way of the thing that was activ fighting me that&amp;#39;s really [ __ ] dumb [ __ ] how many [ __ ] are in this [ __ ] place come on come on Brother come on get it over with I do like that they Dodge it&amp;#39;s very neat yeah so far like it&amp;#39;s like comat is fun when there&amp;#39;s one but when there&amp;#39;s two it&amp;#39;s just kind of like the game just kind of doesn&amp;#39;t know who to lock on to intuitively so you just kind of end up eating [ __ ] for things that aren&amp;#39;t your fault which feels kind of lame sauce to be honest what the heck is this I was wrong wrong wrong no I wasn&amp;#39;t but I was entirely right I need to peel off more something more blood close I was looking outside but it is in me there&amp;#39;s someone inside me you at you I believe she did want to see something real quick there creepy background that Chang as you&amp;#39;re injured is uh my understanding that&amp;#39;s what I&amp;#39;m looking at right now is like the like uh like what level am I at here F hold on somebody may have lied to me about this one [ __ ] the replay this point another indicator it&amp;#39;s harder to tell yeah e okay they&amp;#39;re healing what dbd yeah healing got buffed a lot of healing perks are really good yeah all right I&amp;#39;ll be there in a second oh okay I found out that I uh [ __ ] something up which is really [ __ ] lame and that makes me sad yeah that&amp;#39;s fine I&amp;#39;ll redo that part I had a funky feeling but yeah I [ __ ] I [ __ ] that up that&amp;#39;s really annoying oh want to at least get the apartment on so as is customary apparently twitch streams and the such somebody was not truthful with me earlier or just like didn&amp;#39;t know there been some Mis misinformation about the ending that I was currently slated forwards um and I&amp;#39;ve just been I&amp;#39;m I&amp;#39;m just kind of like [ __ ] now and I don&amp;#39;t get that ending so I think what I&amp;#39;ll do is I&amp;#39;ll just play back up to the point that we are currently at on stream off stream what somebody said that as long as like I&amp;#39;m not below 50% Health like I&amp;#39;m not canceled out of the ending that I was currently going for but that is not the case I just have to be healed up so I&amp;#39;ve been spending a great deal of the game with one hit on me so far cuz I was under the impression that that&amp;#39;s how that worked but apparently that is not the case so that&amp;#39;s pretty sad cuz I have played like four hours of game playay with that and yeah so I&amp;#39;m just [ __ ] because that person lied to me so that is incredibly sick um cuz they had said as long as I was above 50 Health I&amp;#39;d be fine just not the case at all oh I still have to get the thing sucks so much realistically what happens is we&amp;#39;ll get through this part I off stream I play all the way back up to this point don&amp;#39;t you move and you don&amp;#39;t miss a thing we&amp;#39;ll be back on track but the fact that that person lied to me actually like actively upsets me CU like that sign in the right Courtyard um they had lied to me about the parameters for that ending sucks was questioning that but nice to have said something potentially especially cuz I I think I think you were chat when that person said that too but he may have been doing something else there it is should be on the floor here or something right yeah I&amp;#39;m not going to cut the stream short and start that now but and force you guys to sit through any of that it&amp;#39;s not the first time that&amp;#39;s happened on stream like uh there have been Resident Evil games where I&amp;#39;ve had the same situation where like I play like the first part really inefficiently and I just kind of like go back um so um I go back through off stream and start back up and you didn&amp;#39;t miss a thing just I not down like 30 items real quick yeah I&amp;#39;m going to have to do that [Music] see from this think can speed yeah I&amp;#39;ll just like like I said I&amp;#39;ll just do it off stream so you guys don&amp;#39;t have to worry about it sure with the reach new start yeah I&amp;#39;ll be fine it&amp;#39;s just disappointing when from behind the maiden so she has to have a space behind her here comes the man it doesn&amp;#39;t necessarily say that like there lie it on Twitch it could be it could really be anything to be honest could just be them being silly or not you&amp;#39;re actually probably fine I think so I know in the original you have to stay healed up like as much as possible I was told by one person that like you have to as long as you&amp;#39;re not in the actually like Zone like you&amp;#39;re below 50% you&amp;#39;re good not the case I have also looked at certain items more than I should have which I thought were good because they were of Mary but apparently that locks you into a bad ending for some reason hey how&amp;#39;s it going I thought you were playing this earlier did you like it a bunch you&amp;#39;re fine I want the uh yeah I SPO which any I&amp;#39;m going for if people haven&amp;#39;t played it but it&amp;#39;s the one I got in the first one so far it&amp;#39;s really fun about to be in the ouchi zone uh I&amp;#39;m going for a specific ending cuz I played the original and I love that ending ending a lot and uh so I&amp;#39;m going for a specific ending so you can you you are in no trouble I just like that ending a lot from the original so I want to get it again here comes the man s sleep conf I&amp;#39;m not actually giving any thought to this I&amp;#39;m just kind of like devastated at the replay of the game right now but you know see puzzles pain yeah I just haven&amp;#39;t been looking at it long night ahead for bran you have to replay yeah I essentially have to play everything up until this point all over again cuz I just didn&amp;#39;t meet the parameters made some decisions that were first the main sit underneath the tree so here when behind her so she needs a space behind her not in front of her and he goes under the moon on the side where the snake goes so she&amp;#39;s under the tree does she have to be like directly under the tree I would assume so no it is what it is that&amp;#39;s fine um it&amp;#39;s whatever it&amp;#39;s a game I like so I&amp;#39;m not going to hate it the pale moonlight [Music] so behind your you FL alone has to go here comes eyes St shine well he&amp;#39;s under the moon over there if he&amp;#39;s Bel out yeah I&amp;#39;ve looked at Mary stuff more than once maybe even three times so um yeah that&amp;#39;s kind of also something I [ __ ] up cuz I was just like o content but I forgotten that that was the thing I do something to it what do you mean what do you mean let me do oh what oh you flip it over into the flower okay I see you the manth approach is blade now revealed be shining steel there&amp;#39;s the far away from the tree oh I see he killed her definely a large P circumstance I just think it would be really awful if I got that deep in the game and like I had like I didn&amp;#39;t get the ending I wanted after trying so hard these two has his teeth in her CU I I can just make sure by just playing a game I already enjoy a lot all over again you know it is the snake right right it&amp;#39;s 100% the snake that I do want to know I did do that correct right now that it matters I&amp;#39;m going to have to play up until this point again yeah I figured it&amp;#39;s been a while good ending that&amp;#39;s what I remembered but it it been a while just I think that was in there two on yeah we&amp;#39;ll play a little bit more and then I&amp;#39;ll just have to play it all the way back oh other the way and that&amp;#39;s okay this is probably where the thing happens i&amp;#39; imagine is this about where I started watching you play these like during this section it was right about here was it it&amp;#39;s Triangle Man the judgmental traffic cone you got to bust a move real quick jly why does he do that what he just had hit the dab on him I started blasting pyramid realisticly is not that big but he makes big stomping noises like he&amp;#39;s Nemesis sized I make sure always found this part really weird in the original f is my afid of heights my fear of heights also takes that whole like you know [ __ ] you know Crossing into health a little [ __ ] literally there you were literally Crossing in oh he had a little tantrum tantrum hi you look a little different you feeling okay I dodged okay highly press the space bar and he ran right into it and he got hit oh that&amp;#39;s right that was the thing that happened in your stream that I was like whoa I know why I&amp;#39;m to healing up now CU I&amp;#39;ve already [ __ ] it up so doesn&amp;#39;t matter come back office save you a little time maybe that is possible everything is blocked you cannot do anything yeah that&amp;#39;s possible I just don&amp;#39;t know what time I&amp;#39;ve done what you know especially with the trivial stuff like looking at Mary&amp;#39;s items um more than once I don&amp;#39;t know when I did that I definitely looked at it at least once for like you know like content sake but I don&amp;#39;t know if because I&amp;#39;ve definitely looked at more than once okay where the [ __ ] do I go here as much as I love Silent Hill as like a like can I can I get through here oh I can&amp;#39;t break it down as much I love Silent Hill I do think sometimes it kind of airs on this like it gets sometimes it gets on the side of like being too like Hoy toyy with kind of like a subject matter like I again it&amp;#39;s about like deeper matters but sometimes I feel like they just kind of be saying [ __ ] and it doesn&amp;#39;t really have substance Hey Duck how&amp;#39;s it going we&amp;#39;re uh trying to make it through a s Hill to play through oh oh this is where you got you you got really messed up yeah this is hot ass soz I want to be hitting him but I couldn&amp;#39;t be hitting multi combat in this game kind of sucks I will say that like the auto locks thing is not as intuitive so you just kind of end up like dodging the wrong person person at the time which feels like [ __ ] like you&amp;#39;ll be autol locked onto one dude and you&amp;#39;ll want to dodge from the one that&amp;#39;s like coming from the side but like because the game&amp;#39;s like why would you ever want to be locked on the guy behind him you just end up like dodging into the attack you&amp;#39;re trying to avoid which feels like [ __ ] manr the movies Silent Hill the first silent movie is a good movie but not a good Silent Hill movie that makes sense it&amp;#39;s not it&amp;#39;s just like if I could switch targets is there a control for that I just is there just a key binding they haven&amp;#39;t told me like the fact if I could just switch between them it&amp;#39;d be fine but the fact that I can&amp;#39;t makes it to where I just like I can change weapons wow there really is no re no way huh yeah it&amp;#39;s crazy you can&amp;#39;t switch targets so like literally that is something I&amp;#39;m going to have to deal with for the rest of the game that is really unfortunate actually oh [ __ ] me I don&amp;#39;t like that design Scot so that&amp;#39;s the uh position once I get this stuff I think I have to replay everything so I think I&amp;#39;ll play like a tiny bit more and then just and we&amp;#39;ll call it Fe Scott he&amp;#39;ll run from and hide he fled to the west to the other side here yeah play a little bit more just CU it&amp;#39; be kind of lame to end here but I&amp;#39;ll get right back to the same point no I don&amp;#39;t think there&amp;#39;s a visual indicator once again I was talking about this I was kind of like referring to it very vaguely earlier I was like sometimes I feel like Silent Hill in certain aspects kind of gets a little bit too Hoy toyy for its own good like something as small as oh you looked at an item twice instead of once okay now you&amp;#39;re locked out ending it&amp;#39;s just like oh okay um why I don&amp;#39;t know CU we said so and I think at a certain point like s unfortunately does suffer from what like a lot of like other franchises do where like s h great a lot of fans are like oh that&amp;#39;s right that&amp;#39;s a thing I&amp;#39;m kind of just being kind of like LAX of days go with it because I&amp;#39;m obviously going to have to redo all this anyway um anyways what I was saying is that sometimes silent fans try to just like assign meanings to a lot of things that realistically don&amp;#39;t because like the whole game is a subtext of everything that&amp;#39;s happening so like I feel like s fans end up just like trying to sign a meaning to everything in the game where that is like not always the case back go back okay you just randomly do that or you just want to hit away from from Death that entire time yeah the combat in the original is clunky on purpose cuz you&amp;#39;re not supposed to be able to handle combat well as just a normal dude but you could also argue it&amp;#39;s like more um there would be better ways to uh Institute that feeling without literally making the combat feel bad which is what this game does this game does have like Good Feeling combat aside from the one situation where like multiple enemies there seems to be a uh some confusion when it comes to which it character it auto locks to right now I&amp;#39;m just going to be familiarizing myself with the area that I have to go back through later anyways I really do like that song a lot it&amp;#39;s second time it showed up in the game and it usually it hasn&amp;#39;t even played by now [Music] that&amp;#39;s just game mechanic I think it&amp;#39;s one of those things where like when it lands it lands and when it doesn&amp;#39;t it&amp;#39;s like it&amp;#39;s just not my favorite oh no like when it&amp;#39;s cool it&amp;#39;s really cool but when it&amp;#39;s kind of like up to I&amp;#39;m just kind of like okay I press space I even started dodging and it hit me anyway hello excuse the [ __ ] me oh okay I was literally dodging the guy that wasn&amp;#39;t in the room yet by the way I was dodging a guy who was literally not in the room because of the [ __ ] auto lock system that&amp;#39;s [ __ ] sick yeah cuz that guy was in here and he hadn&amp;#39;t even come into the room yet but for some reason James locked onto him so I dodged right into the guy I was currently fighting that&amp;#39;s really obnoxious and it would be it&amp;#39;s a simple fix too it&amp;#39;s just like allow me to switch between enemies organically but like just allow me to have agency over which enemy I I go between but there isn&amp;#39;t so I&amp;#39;m just I&amp;#39;m just [ __ ] in that situation I guess that&amp;#39;s so [ __ ] lame oh taking a lot of damage well the point is like not the fighting without taking a lot of damage but more so just being able or like being um just being healed up all the time no items do that break off do I have think I grab that like it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s like a resource expenditure it&amp;#39;s not like forcing people to do a no hit run it just forces you to expend a lot of resources to stay healed up than you usually would cuz usually in um survival horror games the whole gist of the situation is to uh not burn through healing items so it&amp;#39;s kind of like an anti kind of like thing that you would not like otherwise like know to do also I&amp;#39;m going for a specific ending you can play the game just fine and like not do what I&amp;#39;m doing I just got this ending the first time so I feel attached to it so I want it you canot do what I&amp;#39;m doing and get plenty of the other endings so in a certain sense I&amp;#39;m making the game harder on myself at the same time what how do you avoid that I literally hit the Dodge button and he she just Auto locked onto me like I dodged out of the way and it just didn&amp;#39;t who was one of you was saying like earlier at the beginning of this game&amp;#39;s playthrough that like the Dodge is too strong and it&amp;#39;s just too easy but there&amp;#39;s been like three or four situations in recent memory of just like this stream session where I dodge and I get hit anyway so like is that true yeah just so happens the other guy I&amp;#39;m wanting to go for is the one where like ending that I happened to one is the one where like you got to stay healed up yeah like I I dodged out of the way of that and it just like landed on me and I&amp;#39;m just like okay I don&amp;#39;t know what to do here all right night wh like I said I&amp;#39;m just going to I&amp;#39;m going to have to replay this part anyway so it doesn&amp;#39;t realistically matter too much I just want to see what this area is about yeah but like that&amp;#39;s the thing BR is I was hitting the ey frames the entire game up until this point and then just like randomly in this section I&amp;#39;m just getting like I&amp;#39;m just getting hit it&amp;#39;s to use a gun that is true there&amp;#39;s no point in like worrying about expended ammo like I&amp;#39;m not I&amp;#39;m not going to stick with this run let&amp;#39;s get a HD in yeah but even that that that&amp;#39;s where that one was frustrating cuz I I was in combat with her in an open area and I dodged to the right and she her her [ __ ] like her uh her attack still bounc me like I she still grappled me and I&amp;#39;m like why oh I see I was supposed to grab this I think it&amp;#39;s one of those things where like time makes the heart grow fonder you know I I was like I always look back that like time 2 with almost like a uniquely like perfect lens which is of course like Ro s glasses like nothing&amp;#39;s perfect but like playing through remake I&amp;#39;m seeing how a lot of the uh not so great stuff like stayed in the game as well STP on to death okay I forgot which one I was fighting oopsies I&amp;#39;ve been going the like the old school have just like only using like saving ammo for like big moments not expending it too much but you back here oh my god that&amp;#39;s way easier that&amp;#39;s way easier holy [ __ ] obviously that&amp;#39;s an ammo expender but that&amp;#39;s crazy also I have 8 bullets I think I&amp;#39;m being a little too careful Le I that one part of sill PT I think they went overboard I guess so so I&amp;#39;ll find that out so at the start of night to 80 I haven&amp;#39;t been using it like literally at all yeah I haven&amp;#39;t been using my ammo like literally at all that&amp;#39;s why I hav that this is the first time like what you&amp;#39;re witnessing right now is the first time I&amp;#39;ve used the gun like I just have not been using it the entire time which I&amp;#39;m beginning to realize is kind of silly with the amount of ammo that I now currently have I think my like Neal thumb will be like oh okay this why are there so many in this [ __ ] room I can also stop her stupid little pounce thing too okay why did you oh that&amp;#39;s just an attack you can do I thought he died I was like how did I hurt you oh n okay I about say you didn&amp;#39;t look like one of those the special ones that blow up I was about to be really upset and Confused so like thematically thematically right thematically walk with me here if the whole point of the ending I&amp;#39;m trying to get to is like remembering Mary fondly and like you know mourning her loss and all that wonderful stuff why is looking at her stuff more than once a bad thing to do why that doesn&amp;#39;t make any sense damn me caring about the person that I I you know that was my wife like how [ __ ] me right that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s bad bad stuff right there that doesn&amp;#39;t make sense to me shouldn&amp;#39;t be for the ending you&amp;#39;re going for you sure cuz when I looked up the health state things there&amp;#39;s a thing that&amp;#39;s like yeah well this is important because you should do a BC D EFG to get the to get the ending and I was like oh Wade I see wait if I&amp;#39;m just locked in here what&amp;#39;s the point of being in here why can you break the mirrors yeah why can you get in here what is the what is the purpose Alo that&amp;#39;s funny AIO break evidently say when I get to a part of the game where I&amp;#39;m like resorting to like maze logic to figure out what to do or I&amp;#39;m just kind of like okay just hold my hand to a wall I&amp;#39;ll eventually run into a prompt or something that I need to be at I think I remember talking about this during like the original like play through the game too sto games do be kind of like that where they&amp;#39;re just kind of like the flow of gameplay is very like stop start stop start like they you&amp;#39;ll be like okay I&amp;#39;m picking up the thing to go to the thing to go do the thing to do this and it feels good and it feels great and then out of knowwhere it&amp;#39;ll just be like oh well you didn&amp;#39;t check this one corner of this one room 20 minutes ago so now you&amp;#39;re going to be walking around for hours it&amp;#39;s like a little interesting you can&amp;#39;t interact with that on yeah I feel like that&amp;#39;s maybe why I enjoy res evil more cuz it feels like it doesn&amp;#39;t do that as much cuz like it is part of like silent Hill&amp;#39;s design to be confusing and weird cuz it&amp;#39;s supposed to be like a mind warp Purgatory nightmare thing so like I don&amp;#39;t know kind of makes sense 3 or six I don&amp;#39;t remember we just were we just turned this thing oh we could oh I see so after turning it you can yank it off okay obvious it&amp;#39;s a it&amp;#39;s like it&amp;#39;s hard to make something that&amp;#39;s like obvious to everybody because especially with the game that&amp;#39;s supposed to be like a puzzle at the same time you know you got to make it like sensible without making it like too obvious it&amp;#39;s just like challenging you know let&amp;#39;s see our hand our hand not that kind of our an hour H he man man hello from [ __ ] forward why you so wrong now because there&amp;#39;s multip Co layers of this like evil Purgatory thing how&amp;#39;d you do that in this streate your standards are fairly low aren&amp;#39;t they are you doing it on purpose it the keep imp gz that&amp;#39;s awful that&amp;#39;s rough buddy honestly I&amp;#39;m brand for you realistically but that&amp;#39;s awful I come back to oh fire just being in character doing her thing I know James we were roommates I know him oh it&amp;#39;s this part again it feels like I like unlock an area and then it&amp;#39;s just like okay cool I have anything nothing special at the hour hand we have the hour hand but not the other hand [Music] oh there a reason to be in here yet the lights are on no lights are on but still no reason to be in here we finally played the electricity bill I guess but that doesn&amp;#39;t really have any bearing on what we need to do huh I&amp;#39;m kind of I probably would need to stop soon anyways CU I&amp;#39;m just like my bra is kind of microwaved like I&amp;#39;m not actually thinking I&amp;#39;m just kind of like mindlessly walking and just like praying something shows up because I&amp;#39;m just going of like realizing I have to redo so much and I&amp;#39;m just like H okay this is just suddenly open okay see walking around till something happen does work I&amp;#39;m learning I don&amp;#39;t have to be as concerned about the bullets as I have been at least when I get to the Blue Creek Apartments which are these creepy ones oh hey it&amp;#39;s the Toilet Time toilet time the clock yeah just a cuz it says age for hour know it&amp;#39;s the other one love how much they really milk this show too like not only is he like you know reach again like he&amp;#39;s going like arm deep man what that Prof yeah it&amp;#39;s getting worse in [Music] here it&amp;#39;s getting more and more [ __ ] up interesting oh he just kind of silently waited for me to do that like yeah you know go ahead I know what you&amp;#39;re about to do just get it over with same brother same honestly he righty listen brother I ain&amp;#39;t in that ASMR [ __ ] leave me the [ __ ] alone was back in here was it oh it&amp;#39;s just a part of the figure so I got to find the other part okay okay okay buddy okay whatever you say get off of me door we came in in here we grabed the thing now we must go we should thetically so be able to just go back downstairs and grab or put the minute on the thing and do the puzzle this is a weird d mechanic breaking through walls and [ __ ] I all you sorry don&amp;#39;t you run from me okay run from me buddy ma&amp;#39;am I see you wasn&amp;#39;t trying to waste bullets there but kind of weird yeah I guess for like the learning curve here is that like if you can&amp;#39;t deal with like if you can&amp;#39;t like switch opponents like it&amp;#39;s like a resource expectation at that point it&amp;#39;s like hey you because we have it to where you can&amp;#39;t switch opponents Qui quickly you&amp;#39;re just going to have to expend your pistol ammo to very immediately deal with the threat can I thank you that&amp;#39;s a weird looking Goose I mean Swan sorry wrong word don&amp;#39;t hurt me don&amp;#39;t I&amp;#39;ma me please I know I&amp;#39;m stupid you don&amp;#39;t have to let me know I mean look at me I&amp;#39;m going to run around this apartment like a chicken with my head cut off oh got to balance it balanced is all thing should be hey key get key I don&amp;#39;t think I&amp;#39;ve seen where to put that bad boy there was a tree some tree door somewhere why is that tree that M hand will open once we get the clock arm on it the game is melting my brain insane in the M insane in the bra ah now let me go why am I back in here where am I trying to be what are the secrets to life how do I get out of here where do I go that&amp;#39;s a bathroom how did I get in here and how do I get out through here oh winky oh big hole

that&amp;#39; be nice that&amp;#39;s the hole I came down from oh so the only way I was through here [ __ ] 109 give it up for 109 ammo yeah I&amp;#39;ve been way too conservative about the ammo

I&amp;#39;m not sure what you&amp;#39;re planning but there&amp;#39;s always another way really what&amp;#39;s the point it&amp;#39;s easier just to run maybe it&amp;#39;s all we deserve we me you

we&amp;#39;ll probably be doing that as well H day he good to see you hope you&amp;#39;re doing well this Saturday this Saturday evening um yeah that&amp;#39;s what we&amp;#39;re doing so without further Ado get started previously on The Walking Dead I still like how Le voices all the intros myself like he&amp;#39;s still here supposed to ra a child why is what is happening with the Shadows I wasn&amp;#39;t truthful when I came across y&amp;#39;all at the lodge now folks are dead and I can&amp;#39;t help but feel I&amp;#39;m to blame my question is how did she get so high up in the ranks being still softy you know no no like hard did Carver trust her so much when she was still so soft when you cover yourself and smell believe me it&amp;#39;s a thing I don&amp;#39;t know how car trusted it&amp;#39;s kind of like a confusing go on you don&amp;#39;t need to see this yeah get him K I&amp;#39;m not going anywhere she&amp;#39;s so hard I love her anywhere watching this dude sassy badass clam is like the best yeah we cut off her arm too we were like we&amp;#39;re keeping you on this planet cuz we found out that that works with uh because that one guy the funny dude that was in charge of us he cut off his arm and he he was fine dude I loved doing that Des like the whole time Cara was investigating the house I was just like just like face pan just dead pan the whole time oh she just gets eaten anyway what the [ __ ] what was the Goddamn point of this is this is one of the things that like like I was just talking about like you know how like season 2 in a lot of ways is like a step down from season one that&amp;#39;s one of them there&amp;#39;s so many non choices there&amp;#39;s so many non choices in this game where like no matter what you choose the outcome is literally the same which when when the only game play is choices that&amp;#39;s so dumb won&amp;#39;t let you die to move there&amp;#39;s too many he&amp;#39;s right and now she&amp;#39;s got double bit come on bab she&amp;#39;s dead man leave alone Henny we have to go come on the [ __ ] away from us this is your goddamn fault how it&amp;#39;s going to go like this how was it how was it Clem&amp;#39;s fault alone again we&amp;#39;re going to we&amp;#39;re going to get out of this that&amp;#39; be so cold [ __ ] are saying you&amp;#39;re going to be we can&amp;#39;t make it without you have to let her go I feel like the game&amp;#39;s kind of quiet did I turn down the volume or something yeah Master volumes down a little bit I&amp;#39;m sorry I love you yeah damn it she got bit once and then she got double bit she would have been fine if we cut off her arm but then she like panicked she panicked and then [ __ ] ran into more wait what what oh okay that was weird I&amp;#39;m going after Sarah ow that [ __ ] hurt like the inputs are a little delayed interesting that must be warm too yeah we just need to keep quiet God can&amp;#39;t find anybody I know what are we doing keep moving was with me we can&amp;#39;t stay here Rebecca we need to keep moving such a badass Lookers are still moving make it out if we stick to I&amp;#39;m glad you&amp;#39;re here we can watch each other&amp;#39;s back I&amp;#39;ll stick with you thank you she&amp;#39;s 11 by the way we need clear to the tree she&amp;#39;s 11 years old maybe they&amp;#39;re getting out somewhere do you see any openings anything there was something there damn it go back go back God most reasonable yeah somehow somehow Cory good to see you friend hopefully you&amp;#39;re doing well today you&amp;#39;ll be fine I can&amp;#39;t do this you have to help us we can&amp;#39;t come together like this it&amp;#39;s better if we spread out you two will be fine no you don&amp;#39;t understand just you think we should spread out we spread out you said you would stay with me what were you doing your 11 years old playing Dragon Ball Z games and staying in school that&amp;#39;s what I was doing damn it we&amp;#39;ll have to push through that cluster of Walkers there&amp;#39;s so many we&amp;#39;ll make a cow catcher just we need okay just tell me what to do there that one looks light enough to carry I&amp;#39;m going to get the I need you to get her attention we&amp;#39;re doing what [Music] now just politely tap her anybody now follow me stay close if you fall I can&amp;#39;t come back for you yeah so many of the choices in season 2 are just like incredibly linear and it seems like so much of this is just kind of like a four gun conclusion well that&amp;#39;s the only gameplay that&amp;#39;s kind of like something let&amp;#39;s go or is impact I&amp;#39;m noticing man which is sad cuz there is good stuff in here like K he surviving in Clementine&amp;#39;s growth as a character but like some of it is just you know washer repeat very formula is everything all right no I&amp;#39;m not all right but I&amp;#39;ll be a lot better once we get with the others I need to make sure everyone else made it out Luke Sarah Kenny God damn it what if they aren&amp;#39;t there if they aren&amp;#39;t nothing we can do about it don&amp;#39;t even say things like that fine sorry Jesus I don&amp;#39;t even know if we&amp;#39;re safe what if the herd is still following us we&amp;#39;re fine it&amp;#39;s been quiet but who knows we&amp;#39;ll watch out for each other so long as we keep up a good Pace I know I know just I&amp;#39;m going as fast as I can hey you are on foron an I know I should feel glad that we escaped but I just can&amp;#39;t stop thinking about the others it was stupid what was escaping look I know we all agreed to use the herd to get out but maybe we should have been more patient come up with something better it worked if you can call that working we could have I don&amp;#39;t know Jane saved us I don&amp;#39;t know how we would have gotten out without you you don&amp;#39;t give yourself enough credit I&amp;#39;m just saying that if people hadn&amp;#39;t panicked things might have turned out better you mean like Kenny&amp;#39;s uh new wife Serita [ __ ] like panicking after I saved her life and then getting herself killed and then Kenny blaming me even though she just played it Cal we would have [ __ ] been out like oh so much pain of course we panicked we were scared the plan was good the execution was the messy part that sounds an awful lot like you&amp;#39;re saying it was their fault what no no that&amp;#39;s not what I&amp;#39;m saying just I have to stop I&amp;#39;m sorry I don&amp;#39;t want to slow us down can I just have

fault in the first place it was it oh my god there was nothing I could do seeing how things turned out I think I might have preferred you do nothing I tried to save her you think because

Mike it&amp;#39;s still early Clen how&amp;#39;d it go not great Kenny&amp;#39;s really mad at me Clen you can&amp;#39;t just expect him to bounce back really that man&amp;#39;s going through at least you try still doesn&amp;#39;t exactly help us figure out what we&amp;#39;re going to do now we got no food no water it&amp;#39;s getting damn cold and we&amp;#39;re losing daylight fast when the others get back they&amp;#39;ll know what to do Luc will have a plan we thought Kenny would have a plan Mike honnie Mike&amp;#39;s got a point you can&amp;#39;t just keep sitting around waiting things are difficult enough right now and soon you&amp;#39;ll have a baby on your hands too what suddenly you&amp;#39;re pretending to be concerned seeing you people floundering the minute things don&amp;#39;t go according to plan is just got me on edge all right Rebecca needs a safe warm place to have her baby maybe we should keep moving and find one doubles down she&amp;#39;s just under so much grief that I can&amp;#39;t expect him to act in any way rational you know sure you&amp;#39;re it keeps going through so much yeah listen Rebecca if anything goes wrong here you got something to protect yourself I&amp;#39;ve got this you don&amp;#39;t think I&amp;#39;d need to I don&amp;#39;t know but you better keep that close come on Clen I like the Civil War inventry considering the state of our group at the moment makes me nervous very nervous look I&amp;#39;m going to level with you there&amp;#39;s no real point in scouting ahead and you should know that finding your friends that&amp;#39;s a shot in the dark well then why&amp;#39; we come out here I wanted to talk to you away from them you wouldn&amp;#39;t have made it this far if you weren&amp;#39;t smart but I still I just got to warn you that group is cracking I&amp;#39;ve seen it before and well a lot of times it&amp;#39;s better to be on your own I know you see what I&amp;#39;m talking about you don&amp;#39;t want to be here when they start they&amp;#39;re not bad people but there have been problems before I don&amp;#39;t always agree with what they say or do neither do I usually does but it just takes him a while to get there I don&amp;#39;t know where to begin with what a liability it doesn&amp;#39;t process stuff for a long time situation is not making things better back there you get enough broken people together and all you&amp;#39;re going to get are broken decisions how can you get along without trusting anyone that&amp;#39;s exactly how I get along for what it&amp;#39;s worth I like most of the people in your crew but groups fall apart people get killed then why did you bring me with you I&amp;#39;m just trying to give you the tools you need to make it if you want to like your jacket it looks warm but a walker will bite right through that my sister Jamie had a good leather one wish I still had it you could have I always wanted a sister I used to make my babysitter Sandra play a game G that we were Secret Sisters it was stupid kid stuff you know being a big sister is well it&amp;#39;s funny it&amp;#39;s really easy to be mean oh you know hide her toys make fun of her bad haircut give her the bad haircut on purpose I mean I did put the gum there I figured I should get it out I don&amp;#39;t even know why is that really what it&amp;#39;s like having a sister no no it&amp;#39;s not all bad but what could I do she thought I was her best friend I couldn&amp;#39;t go unpunished every summer we&amp;#39;d go to this amusement park in Virginia but the best part wasn&amp;#39;t the rides it was that nobody knew us there and I&amp;#39;d I&amp;#39;d pretend we weren&amp;#39;t sisters just friends all right jackpot bet these walkers got some good stuff yeah we should check them out but you know why right only because they&amp;#39;re fresh take a look I love Club they&amp;#39;re holding credit cards and busted old pagers but these ones weren&amp;#39;t loers all that long ago they were survivors they might have useful stuff that one&amp;#39;s not coming back see what else he&amp;#39;s got I&amp;#39;ll check this one smart haircut blind play through yeah I&amp;#39;ve never played it before I had seen bits and pieces of season one but nothing been so dysfunctional you fit in there but you weren&amp;#39;t like them I was with a different group before that one worked better I think that was when I got my haircut like this find anything driver&amp;#39;s licenses two of them well I guess some people just can&amp;#39;t leave the past behind hold on to him Emo&amp;#39;s getting hard to come by and things aren&amp;#39;t going to get better all right bar she&amp;#39;s just like the side ey file these things are great sharpen a blade strike a flint Jamie always had one in her purse it jab my hand when I went reaching in can never be too sure with these things here give me a hand these glasses they&amp;#39;re Sarah&amp;#39;s oh looks like your friend didn&amp;#39;t make it sorry all we know is that she was here it could be a good sign don&amp;#39;t go getting your hopes up look Clen good want to say but s God damn hey see [ __ ] okay come on we got to find a way in looks like there&amp;#39;s an opening over there like that&amp;#39;s Luke too oh oh no that sucks it&amp;#39;s Nick or Nick sorry wrong guy got to show back the car the season look he&amp;#39;s your friend you should do this oops goodbye he existed yeah I know he didn&amp;#39;t die right away so he got to get killed off somehow you just [ __ ] bite it not like L bite something don&amp;#39;t spread the disease but like literally bite it like die fight the bullet hey noodle what&amp;#39;s up are it&amp;#39;s all right it&amp;#39;s done if it comes to it if Luke or Sarah or anybody needs to be put down you got to be ready for it seems like a girl cuz she is one that be why you know that right I know that hatchet of yours seems to get stuck pretty easily going to get you killed here use this very effective we can do this second season more it&amp;#39;s not bad it&amp;#39;s just pretty linear like a lot of your decisions don&amp;#39;t matter sometimes characters are reacting kind of rashly because they&amp;#39;re because Clem is the main main character now so they&amp;#39;re treating her like an adult when they I feel like they wouldn&amp;#39;t do that as much I&amp;#39;m ready I know you are we need to get a better look how about you get the close one and I&amp;#39;ll hop the fence to get the other go for it like this makes sense with Jane because Jane is obviously having a soft spot for like uh Jade&amp;#39;s having a soft spot for her sister which is reminding her of CLM which is you know why she&amp;#39;s putting so much on nice work you know what you&amp;#39;re doing because like a it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s an emotionally thing but it&amp;#39;s because of the way she feels about her little sister the other characters don&amp;#39;t really have a reason to Tre the way they do pick out the knees first then put a knife in the back of its head when it&amp;#39;s down all right let&amp;#39;s get a look at what we&amp;#39;ve got on Deck it&amp;#39;s going to take some work to get over there there&amp;#39;s too many we&amp;#39;re not getting in while they&amp;#39;re still hanging out over there maybe we can get them to move anybody any bell towers well let&amp;#39;s see if we can find anything over there oh [ __ ] stop it I was already mashing Q doing it you did the knee thing nice trick huh she&amp;#39;s so proud of herself he&amp;#39;s like that&amp;#39;s a lot of Walkers they look worked up about something and what gets the interest of the dead people how do we get in if we can make enough noise on this side we can lure those Walkers over here then we might just be able to go through that other trailer and get to your friends what do you think of that if you think that&amp;#39;s best I&amp;#39;m with you good what&amp;#39;s going to grab their attention I got you covered uh probably the car alarm I would imagine hking the Horn of the truck I would [Music] imagine watch our backs get it yes Valkyrie joke that&amp;#39;s good but we need to keep it going somehow [Music] let&amp;#39;s find a way to keep it on okay how do I get out of this then okay back out there we go nothing there not going to bang on the barricade what are you thinking if we lean him on the horn it&amp;#39;ll keep honking and draw the Walkers just like moths to a flame give me a hand been having dreams lately probably because of this game about me living in a zombie apocalypse I do better in my dreams than I do and I probably would ever would in real life it&amp;#39;s working come on what are you doing why are you doing this KNE KN there you go come on why did it stop we got to move it wait why did it stop did they move the body wait why did that stop then try something else you&amp;#39;re

in there you were ready to help but then something changed look I just I&amp;#39;d seen that kind of thing before I just didn&amp;#39;t want to stick around for The Bitter End sorry I I don&amp;#39;t mean to sound harsh it&amp;#39;s just the way things are it&amp;#39;s okay I get it things aren&amp;#39;t always simple and just because you got her out of there today doesn&amp;#39;t mean you saved her trust me I tried to save Jamie too but she gave up I just I can&amp;#39;t believe it as soon as you guys said go I was the first one up on the roof like I had already made up my mind Luke you can&amp;#39;t let it eat away at you relax it&amp;#39;s not a big deal what are you worried about brother well I can&amp;#39;t forget it forget what I dragged my sister across four states and every morning she&amp;#39;d say she wasn&amp;#39;t getting up so I&amp;#39;d convince her or push her or goddamn carrier if I had to until this time Walkers cornered us forced us up to the roof and then when they kept coming I I couldn&amp;#39;t make her jump couldn&amp;#39;t throw her so I tried something else I told her she could have what she wanted and I left her there damn jumped to the next building over by myself you left your sister Jane I&amp;#39;m really sorry it killed me for a long time but I finally realized that I&amp;#39;d put her on a forced March through hell but all she really wanted was for me to Let Her Go Sarah was that way too Jane no regard for her own safety or ours Sarah and Jamie aren&amp;#39;t the same person we don&amp;#39;t know if she&amp;#39;ll end up like that people don&amp;#39;t change people do change for better often for let&amp;#39;s get back to your friends everybody changes son of a [ __ ] you found him yeah I&amp;#39;m a little amazed myself tell you the truth it weren&amp;#39;t for Clement Jane well I don&amp;#39;t know what would have happened Clement Jane SS like like a like a brand Sarah like a condent brand or something oh you know my favorite brand of grape jelly is Clem Jane I&amp;#39;m just glad you&amp;#39;re here is dead right no he&amp;#39;s not where&amp;#39;s nick uh Rebecca how about we uh we go for a walk for a minute let&amp;#39;s just give him some space I have something I need to talk to you about too why am I so damn important I&amp;#39;m just a child oh probably got I ain&amp;#39;t going to sugar coat this that baby&amp;#39;s coming even faster than Rebecca&amp;#39;s letting on but I was hoping you might no does Luke know anything about babies has he I don&amp;#39;t know mentioned Carlos teaching him anything no I don&amp;#39;t think so I was afraid of that I don&amp;#39;t know anything Mike sure as hell doesn&amp;#39;t I don&amp;#39;t even know how to ask Jane and that just leaves y good old Kenny good old K he went in there after he left said he needed a minute by himself I ain&amp;#39;t seen him since I don&amp;#39;t think he&amp;#39;s doing well I&amp;#39;ll go in there thank you Clan I this isn&amp;#39;t making her do an adult decision really it&amp;#39;s as much as like he has the long this relationship with him out of anybody so that makes a little bit more sense I wanted to check on you make sure you&amp;#39;re okay you know what it feels like to get beaten almost to death peaceful it feels peaceful it was like I was floating away watching the whole thing happen to me and then I woke up again and nothing&amp;#39;s changed I&amp;#39;m still taking a beaten every day duck gotcha Serita no peace no rest the punch is just keep coming why the hell couldn&amp;#39;t Carver have just finished me off obviously I ain&amp;#39;t helping anyone by being here that baby&amp;#39;s almost here and Rebecca needs your help yeah I guess she does n don&amp;#39;t worry yourself about this it&amp;#39;s nothing hadn&amp;#39;t killed me yet anyway don&amp;#39;t be stupid it could be infected well oh [ __ ] does that mean what I think it does what are we supposed to do we should see what&amp;#39;s going on I mean he&amp;#39;s not wrong like you might imagine emotional turmoil and he&amp;#39;s undertaking not that like he he has suffered a lot how does it feel it feels wet that&amp;#39;s how it feels what&amp;#39;s going on Rebecca&amp;#39;s water broke oh Christ we should I don&amp;#39;t know what we should do oh [ __ ] that means the baby&amp;#39;s coming right Kenny yeah she&amp;#39;s 11 she wouldn&amp;#39;t know that I think the baby&amp;#39;s coming what do we do all right all right give me a second no way can Rebecca Trapper like this he&amp;#39;s right she&amp;#39;s going to make a lot of noise they&amp;#39;ll be able to smell her too this place doesn&amp;#39;t seem safe for a baby being born that map shows a couple of buildings nearby maybe one of them could do the trick the museum seems like it could be a good start I&amp;#39;ll go good idea m think you could go with her sure thing I&amp;#39;ll check the building by the river okay then Kenny you uh you stick with Rebecca and I will check the perimeter for Walkers Sarah Sarah you just stay here with Rebecca and Kenny okay Clen I know it must have been hard but thank you for talking to Kenny I&amp;#39;d love for you to give me and ma a hand looking at the Museum but I was thinking how do we know Jane ain&amp;#39;t just going to take off maybe you should go with her make sure she comes back what do you mean by that it&amp;#39;s not like you can force her to stay here doesn&amp;#39;t seem to like being around people much and she volunteered to head off awful fast I guess it could be nothing she&amp;#39;s helped us so far and nether she does walk off like yeah no you&amp;#39;re right maybe it&amp;#39;s nothing we can&amp;#39;t keep her here just something to think about she&amp;#39;s not like forced to be part of our group she doesn&amp;#39;t want to be F she assd super helpful yeah warm blankets clean water disinfected that all sound right don&amp;#39;t worry everything&amp;#39;s going to be fine I don&amp;#39;t know who to go with it what Sarah Mike and Bonnie Mike and Bonnie have it handled they don&amp;#39;t need that I&amp;#39;m not really putting a lot of stock in Jane not coming back but if I&amp;#39;m going to go anywhere probably go with Jane but I also have the option to stay with Sarah uh but if I&amp;#39;m staying with Sarah I&amp;#39;m staying with everybody who&amp;#39;s uh who&amp;#39;s still here so that&amp;#39;d be uh Rebecca and Kenny as well um I think I&amp;#39;ll just stay I think I want to check on Sarah I&amp;#39;ll help everyone else too I think that&amp;#39;d be good yeah yeah sure all right everyone Jane is self-sufficient she doesn&amp;#39;t really need help and let&amp;#39;s be careful and honestly if they had put that forward that Bonnie hadn&amp;#39;t put forward that maybe she would leave I wouldn&amp;#39;t even think about going with her anyway hey Sarah you know Rebecca&amp;#39;s starting they were going to leave me weren&amp;#39;t they of course not Luke tried really hard to get you to come with him how come you didn&amp;#39;t leave me as were friends because we&amp;#39;re friends I could never be that good of a friend I just want my dad I know when he when he gets here we should all go back to the ca he&amp;#39;s dead sweetheart we safe there Sarah your dad you know he isn&amp;#39;t coming right Sarah hey I think that&amp;#39;s all she can take for now she&amp;#39;ll be all right I don&amp;#39;t know about that could really use a hand Scout for supplies oh so once again it was a non-choice you can check on Sarah but like it really doesn&amp;#39;t matter I&amp;#39;ll go help Jane good don&amp;#39;t be too long if you can help it okay so it was another non-choice thank you

go cry and that makes those things come please if that medicine&amp;#39;s for your sister why are you hiding it in the garbage I uh I need to keep it I need to keep it safe sister or not we could really use that stuff you are not nice people you have already left me defenseless and now you you take my sister&amp;#39;s medicine you hey we&amp;#39;ve got people who are suffering who need this medicine Luke&amp;#39;s still a wreck after Carvers Kenny&amp;#39;s a mess Rebecca&amp;#39;s in pain look at all of it Clementine we need that stuff are suffering just as much as yours you are not special Clementine yes you must we don&amp;#39;t believe a [ __ ] word about your sick sister please don&amp;#39;t make my sister suffer this one&amp;#39;s hard cuz like cuz usually what I go to in situations like this is that if you do like it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s just like in season one right like with the car there were people the the people that needed that actually ended up coming back to haunt us right like they came back to to to like put one over and us really really badly so by us just taking it we just made a bunch of enemies or made one really bad enemy be more exact but like um yeah it always seems very uh yeah you don&amp;#39;t want to make more enemies she has been through enough oh yeah doesn&amp;#39;t make a whole lot of sense though he&amp;#39;s also foreign like I know that&amp;#39;s kind of what the game is pushing on us right is that like oh well his story doesn&amp;#39;t make any sense so that&amp;#39;s why we should just take the bag but also like he&amp;#39;s also he&amp;#39;s also clearly not from here he&amp;#39;s babbling Russian every other sentence so his ability to explain himself he&amp;#39;s not able to explain himself even in his first language you know yeah freck that&amp;#39;s what I would ideally do in this situation which was the same thing the the the same deal that I had with um it was the same deal I had with the the car situation from season one it was like call out search around for the people if you don&amp;#39;t find them immediately take some not all take some just enough to hold us over for like a day and then just like leave the rest which is yeah like that that was that was my idea but also like I said I don&amp;#39;t know if the game would really take into take this into account but like he uh that&amp;#39;s obviously not his first language or uh English is not obviously his first language the way he&amp;#39;s explaining things is probably not um not uh as accurate or as fluent as it would be in his language H well I think you&amp;#39;re just some junkie you know what that word means huh oh no I&amp;#39;m I&amp;#39;m telling the truth I swear upon my own life you&amp;#39;re not taking them I&amp;#39;m not robbing anybody just let them go oh bu thank you Clementine thank you what are you doing you don&amp;#39;t have to do this Jane what are you doing don&amp;#39;t you ever come around here again I don&amp;#39;t care if you do have some sick sister the next time I see you you won&amp;#39;t just be walking away go [Music] can&amp;#39;t believe I&amp;#39;ve gotten into this in this threatening some stupid kid I thought we were just going to talk to him I needed to make sure he didn&amp;#39;t come back here again I definitely wouldn&amp;#39;t uh I wouldn&amp;#39;t have Rebecca&amp;#39;s baby here cuz that guy knows about it now go get the others I&amp;#39;m going to get this place open pocket we need to get moved in ASAP oh so we&amp;#39;re just going to settle in the place where we know a guy is here that now probably hates us that&amp;#39;s not smart that&amp;#39;s not smart at all Clen Clen hey any luck with that observation dick I was just checking on Rebecca and Kenny they said they hadn&amp;#39;t heard from me in a while I don&amp;#39;t guess there&amp;#39; be much but Jane seems pretty resourceful Jane and I were trying to open the gift shop and a stranger showed up what [ __ ] this is the last thing we need right now I&amp;#39;m worried he might be dangerous well I uh glad you&amp;#39;re okay not really him dangerous but like be traveling with yeah she&amp;#39;s trying to get theop open you know I can&amp;#39;t figure her out I mean she really lays it on the line but at the same time she doesn&amp;#39;t show you anything that counts I like her she&amp;#39;s honest and she knows what she&amp;#39;s doing still little un sometimes that&amp;#39;s more than I can say for some Jane seems like the kind of person who gets tempered by hardship you know but when I look at Kenny now he just he seems broken broken people get Reckless I know you got a history with him look I think he&amp;#39;s a good guy at least started as a good guy you&amp;#39;re wrong he stronger than anyone he tries to protect us I don&amp;#39;t know Glen I used to think that maybe all the horror hadn&amp;#39;t gotten to you yet but you watched your friend murder Carver not just kill him but CL you didn&amp;#39;t even blank what would you have done if it was you well I don&amp;#39;t know really I don&amp;#39;t I just think less I need to tell the others about the deck yeah good I will uh I&amp;#39;ll see you back there this game so far season one was fantastic and I can see why it was like such a like a constantly played game back in the day by everyone season 2 it&amp;#39;s kind of like way more linear and it feels like half my decisions or more just kind of don&amp;#39;t matter and they&amp;#39;re kind of like non decisions it feels like the characters act kind of like rashly sometimes and kind of like weird because Clementine&amp;#39;s being treated essentially as adult despite not being one I&amp;#39;m not supposed to be in labor yet Kenny what if something bad by any means just babies know how to be born Clementine where&amp;#39;d you find the building around back has an observation deck somewhere the baby will be safer it&amp;#39;s coming so much faster than I thought it&amp;#39;s high up so it should be safe from Walkers sounds good as soon as M can bnie your back will go yeah all this would make sense if like if I were still Lee right but like as clam that doesn&amp;#39;t make a whole lot of sense glad you made it back safe how are you feeling scared and it hurts I wish Alvin was here Alvin would be really proud of you right now you think so I hope you&amp;#39;re right I know it&amp;#39;s a waste of time but I can&amp;#39;t stop thinking about things I should have said to him that&amp;#39;s also true talk to him about how am I ever going to do this without him well I&amp;#39;ll help you keep the baby safe oh yeah you&amp;#39;re a good kid Clementine I&amp;#39;m glad you&amp;#39;ll be there to watch out for this baby oh [ __ ] I got this we ain&amp;#39;t seen Miker Bonnie in a while and I&amp;#39;m not saying I don&amp;#39;t trust him but I&amp;#39;d appreciate it if you went and checked up on him yeah go on ahead I&amp;#39;ll be fine a lot of dead people here hey clone I thought you went with Jane she didn&amp;#39;t take off did she we found a place for Rebecca to have the baby an observation deck with a gift shop it&amp;#39;s way up high and pretty safe from the wind oh that&amp;#39;s great just give me like 10 more minutes to search around he doesn&amp;#39;t want to go back empty-handed what I just want to help oh I am actively playing keep one eye on the woods while we&amp;#39;re in here I don&amp;#39;t want nothing sneaking up on us I&amp;#39;ll watch this side you watch the other souvenirs huh looking for a keychain with your name on it no why would I want a keychain I don&amp;#39;t even have any Keys good point hey look at this an old coat nice good find Clen you should hang on to that it&amp;#39;s going to get a lot colder before it starts getting warmer Kenny said we need blankets it&amp;#39;s not really a blanket but but it should do the trick good call I guess you&amp;#39;ve already got that old code I gave you I feel so bad about everything that happened hopefully you won&amp;#39;t always think of me like that not that I blame you if you did I haven&amp;#39;t always used the best judgment you finally opened your eyes about Carver and what a bad person he was that&amp;#39;s something yeah Clen found a jacket that&amp;#39;s great but uh isn&amp;#39;t gray the you know uh we can&amp;#39;t put Rebecca in a Confederate coat oh I didn&amp;#39;t even think about that guess it&amp;#39;s better than nothing though uh fun fact actually uh just as uh yeah I&amp;#39;m not going to pause do that um fun fact a lot lot of the South actually did not have a plentiful amount of uniforms um because almost all the factories were in the north watch where you&amp;#39;re so like the like in terms of like generalized production for like uniforms and supplies like a lot of the factories in the north so the North had most of that stuff a lot of people in the South just kind of like had to scramble stuff together no not so much unless you want some broken glass than you teacher yeah there&amp;#39;s my degree going to work I tell you I sure don&amp;#39;t like being near a graveyard with the world the way it is now way things are now you&amp;#39;re in a graveyard all the time yeah true over here Water bottled and clean that&amp;#39;s just what we need yeah the south is mostly like farms and stuff like that so they had like like rations they had like Food Supplies but in terms of mass production maybe you know if somebody was small which is a lot of the reason that they did so well sque through that Gap there I could try to pry it open some more but I don&amp;#39;t know if that&amp;#39;ll help much all right all right I&amp;#39;ll go thanks Clen just open the door from the other side Mike will carry those things out might be a bit heavy for you this be on the test oh I mean I would have put on a test back in the day okay maybe I push from I knew there would be a [ __ ] Walker in here cuz of course there has to be break the door down this whole time well that happened thanks Mike yeah no problem I&amp;#39;m so sorry about that Clementine we should have been more careful well we got water now at least now we got something to bring back I&amp;#39;ll keep checking the other room yeah you keep doing that you keep doing that maybe something will magically [ __ ] appear just make the [ __ ] child carry this giant ass thing hey I got this don&amp;#39;t that looks pretty heavy it&amp;#39;s all right I know it looks like a lot we could all go through this pretty quick cargo was crazy but at least his shelves were always full we&amp;#39;ll make a plan everyone will have enough I hope so that baby&amp;#39;s going to be hard on everyone especially Rebecca and between you and me she&amp;#39;s not looking too good hey guys come on stay close it just walked on in like it owned the place figure it&amp;#39;d make a nice meal we can eat raccoon I&amp;#39;d eat the [ __ ] out of that raccoon not like I mean just just that I&amp;#39;d be really happy to eat that raccoon I am starving fresh meat would go a

wasn&amp;#39;t doing well but I didn&amp;#39;t know she was [ __ ] dying oh my [Music] God no matter what I a li since you robbed him this kind of what I hate about season 2 is just like so many choices are just non choices right like nothing really matter matters like the story is kind of just kind of like for the most part just kind of like written one way and then like you can make choices that kind of add some flavor attacks here and there but by and large the story is just kind of going to happen the same way it always does and there&amp;#39;s not much you can really do to actually like change things and I think that that&amp;#39;s when that&amp;#39;s the only gameplay available to you is like having your choices making those choices and having them matter like that&amp;#39;s kind of lame well here goes the last episode previously on The Walking Dead killing one in order to save many is part of survival you did nothing I don&amp;#39;t know need a minute but like yeah like I said it&amp;#39;s like the choice doesn&amp;#39;t matter right misery right then favorite do you know swws this really was your favorite interesting broken broken people give my favorite is one so far but obviously I&amp;#39;m lik need to get to the other ones here good see though be thanks if things start heading south don&amp;#39;t let them drag you down with them matter much yeah

back watch your language I didn&amp;#39;t want you to go in the first place thanks that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s good because you&amp;#39;re probably 90% of the reason I came back oh and it&amp;#39;d

pair on I should have gave myself up Alvin didn&amp;#39;t have to die like that I&amp;#39;m going to think about that every time I look at Alvin Jr here you can&amp;#39;t help that evil men want to do

for how I acted back there after see he always comes around like he gets upset in the moment but he always realizes what he&amp;#39; been wrong later I couldn&amp;#39;t handle his ability to apologize Sor like always hit me you could I wish more people were like him you tried to help and I blamed you for it you don&amp;#39;t have anything to apologize for I know you didn&amp;#39;t mean it thanks if half the people in the world were like Kenny were like owned up to mistakes the world would be a way better place I miss him so much I didn&amp;#39;t raise him like I should have made mistakes wasn&amp;#39;t there a whole lot for a couple years off on a boat somewhere or other I thought I enjoyed that time away from him from my family but I&amp;#39;d give anything for one more second with them yeah to play catch with duck to touch kot&amp;#39;s face I miss duck too he was a good friend and I haven&amp;#39;t had too many of them he was a good boy pure just wanted folks to be happy that&amp;#39;s all boy like that thrown into a world like this it&amp;#39;s going to be different with him he&amp;#39;s going to get raised right I won&amp;#39;t make the same mistakes again again that&amp;#39;s a promise you should get back over by the fire those should the baby ain&amp;#39;t no sense in both of us being over here the baby might be cold maybe you should bring him by the fire yeah okay you can only offer the you can&amp;#39;t talk to her just take take alkohol they expect you to lure me over there with alcohol I wouldn&amp;#39;t have expected a bottle to last this long will it work probably been a while for everyone we just want you to feel welcome it&amp;#39;s warm over so much yeah we complet the whole episode what is it it&amp;#39;s from thought so far this is my favorite episode and it&amp;#39;s the last one of the Season like if this episode if this if the SE have been more or the season had been more like it this episode it would have been great I don&amp;#39;t know it might be awkward I wasn&amp;#39;t expecting to you know be around only if you make it beird if you save Sarah no just be cool hang out I wish it was that easy it is people just love making it harder than it has to be that is so [ __ ] true is so true like I&amp;#39;m signing a contract or something doesn&amp;#39;t have to be that [ __ ] difficult people make [ __ ] so difficult for themselves they just don&amp;#39;t have to have you had any you want to sit it&amp;#39;s okay um sure here the first time oh in the trailer yes in the trailer yeah uh oh busted I better take that back I wasn&amp;#39;t too much older than you when I had my first drink God I was so stupid back then just matter this time I broke into my parents liquor cabinet and drank a whole bottle of this really Spicy Sweet liquor what was its name that was dumb earthquake or something sounds like you were a bad kid I guess I was Fireball that&amp;#39;s what I was thinking at the bottom of the bottle there were these yeah Jade is like what Molly should have been I got it in my head that I really wanted to eat a couple so I got the bright idea to smash it on my parents&amp;#39; dining room floor to get at them and it shattered into a thousand pieces all over the dining room did you ever get caught yeah the problem with glasses it looks a lot like sugar crystals that&amp;#39;s never really been a problem for me keep it that way yeah same Cory found me drunk blood pouring out of my mouth Jamie thought I was dying so she called 911 holy [ __ ] CL I haven&amp;#39;t thought about that in a long time [Music] language I guess it deals deal here time to not make it weird lot time people rather make it weird than they just face the things they need to face want to sit here no that&amp;#39;s I&amp;#39;m fine oh yeah okay wherever you like J has changed the dialog not the story that&amp;#39;s what it feels like with this season AR over here by himself wait I didn&amp;#39;t get to talk to him Jane you don&amp;#39;t have to justify that with a response hey I find it&amp;#39;s best to just get this stuff out in the open let Dr well that&amp;#39;s fine but I can confirm there was no time for kissing Lord oh man out the open oh all right enough of that hey you clam it&amp;#39;s nice to hear people laughing yeah it is you just spend so much time trying to stay alive that you don&amp;#39;t get a chance to enjoy living well season one my choices actually mattered we need to make more time for that and this season not so much alcohol helps hell yeah it does momy&amp;#39;s crying over there we got someone else that might need some help sounds like a waste of good rum shut up Kenny he lost a sister today and whose fault was that that makes it even harder to deal with trust me I don&amp;#39;t like it either but we shouldn&amp;#39;t let it ruin a nice night I said my peace is it wouldn&amp;#39;t that be is it is it when you say that saying is it like my piece like my piece of like like a piece of something or is it I said my piece is in like like I spoke my truth so it would be like you know Zen piece like Pac is that how it&amp;#39;s supposed to be hold on I&amp;#39;m actually interested oh my God there&amp;#39;s actually a thing in the dictionary about this say your PE peace and hold your peace or separate idioms say your pece so like Kenny said it refers to stating your opinion or your piece or part of the conversation yeah flash HBY thank you so much for the follow I appreciate that hope you&amp;#39;re doing well tonight friend thank you for uh the follow try to make that worthwhile this often confused withhold your piece which is often ass associated with marriage objections that refers to remaining silent oh so say your pieces say your piece for part of the conversation but uh if you&amp;#39;re um if you&amp;#39;re like withdrawing from a conversation it&amp;#39;s hold your piece and that&amp;#39;s where people get confused okay I&amp;#39;m learning a lot about about about uh I&amp;#39;ve learned a whole lot of things playing this game today first I&amp;#39;m biing and now this I don&amp;#39;t think that boy I&amp;#39;m more educated today I just think good people do bad things sometimes and they do it a lot more nowadays with World being what it is so I think it&amp;#39;s best leave me alone stop being a baby sorry okay my fault I shouldn&amp;#39;t have leave me alone and you stay back there don&amp;#39;t do anything weird it&amp;#39;s okay it&amp;#39;s okay she&amp;#39;s in a better place it&amp;#39;s okay it&amp;#39;s okay maybe it&amp;#39;s best if we all get some rest who knows how long a walk we got tomorrow yeah that&amp;#39;s a good idea I&amp;#39;ll take first watch thank you Kenny really I uh don&amp;#39;t mention it you did good it was nice while it lasted for and this is where everything gets bad you sure you&amp;#39;re good yeah yeah I&amp;#39;m good if I I start the crap out

done something you regret even if it&amp;#39;s something you knew you had to do yeah everyone has go on all the time yeah what you do with them the matters so I&amp;#39;ll say one thing about Luke no matter where you end up there&amp;#39;s always one Bad Seed rocking the boat but I don&amp;#39;t think he would have ever been that guy let me ask you something Clen when&amp;#39;s the last time anyone did what you wanted good question I don&amp;#39;t really know what I want maybe ought to start thinking about it this from last time while we escaped from car&amp;#39;s group run with a lot of people run into a Russian Bandit uh listen to a lot of that killed a lot of us and I were just trying to survive ain&amp;#39;t one of them come true I&amp;#39;m starting to think there might be another way you know I&amp;#39;m going to go take a piss yeah whether it was Walkers or that Russian Bandit group a lot of a lot of us are no longer here now we at this Hideout uh which belong to the Russian Bandon group that we killed the most of down to like one dude but they have supplies and stuff so we&amp;#39;re chilling here for now looks broken same with attch on the Star season no it&amp;#39;s like a completely new thing that just showed up last uh episode busted need any help I&amp;#39;m fine go check on AJ hey Mike and arvo wouldn&amp;#39;t shut up so I moved him in here well he was clearly in on the Bandit group and wanted to Rob and kill us so yeah not a fantastic person but you know son of a [ __ ] he&amp;#39;ll be fine CLM he beat that boy within an inch of his life we are way past fine I know Kenny&amp;#39;s a nice guy Glen I bet Carver was a nice guy too once probably had a nice job and a nice pretty wife then all this happened and one day he caved some kids face in and realized he could sleep at [Music] night Kenny isn&amp;#39;t Carver he just made a mistake all I&amp;#39;m saying is start thinking about what happens if you&amp;#39;re wrong well he did beat him with an inch of Life which was unnecessary but yeah two each other a long time not you&amp;#39;re going to have to decide how much that&amp;#39;s worth [Music] I think it needs food or something it you mean him baby not a robot seems like you&amp;#39;ve done that before want to try no way it&amp;#39;s going to puke Clen no hold it like this hey hi my name&amp;#39;s Jane I think it&amp;#39;s going to puke it&amp;#39;s not going to puke get puked get puked gross there&amp;#39;s much left I was running with some people a long time ago down near DC some guy got trapped in the middle of a crosswalk can&amp;#39;t remember his name he used to call me Mary Jane he was a douchebag anyway the dick got stuck under a car hiding from a dozen Walkers one after another they went down there trying to save him lost four people before we got him out all that for one person that&amp;#39;s what I&amp;#39;m saying didn&amp;#39;t find out till later he was already bit turned and ripped the neck right out of this old lady the look on her face was she was just staring up at the sky like she was watching a bird look Clen he got it working was a tank I remember that first episode I did watch that it works what I tell you so what&amp;#39;s the plan how much food do we have at least a week and for the baby we need to find a place for the baby yeah some place warm I agree we should head back south what we&amp;#39;re kind of freeze to death that&amp;#39;s what I said stupid idea it was to March up here in the first place but it was a bad one she&amp;#39;s right what if we went back to house wait what [ __ ] that I was thinking more like Texas Texas the [ __ ] it was just an idea we already talked about this I&amp;#39;m sorry we did we&amp;#39;re going to find Wellington right Clen Wellington Penny it&amp;#39;s freezing up here man we don&amp;#39;t have to leave right now let&amp;#39;s just sleep on it that sounds damn it we don&amp;#39;t have time says you yeah we do look I don&amp;#39;t give two shits about what you people think I got this truck working so I say where we go and we&amp;#39;re heading [ __ ] North it&amp;#39;s the best chance we got to help an AJ why are we going up to Wellington again who oh the rusy yeah he ain&amp;#39;t coming with us you&amp;#39;re just going to leave him here I don&amp;#39;t give a good goddamn where he goes he&amp;#39;s done we should ask him what he wants there&amp;#39;s a concept knows he can help us that is true some help he&amp;#39;s been he got Luke killed I ain&amp;#39;t going to say he helped the situation but maybe if you eased up on him before he wouldn&amp;#39;t have run away in the first place you think about that Kenny either way I&amp;#39;m not going anywhere in the middle of the night true yeah me neither there could be a hurt out there you want that child&amp;#39;s blood on your hands Mike we&amp;#39;re all going to die out here if you don&amp;#39;t calm the [ __ ] down Kenny haven&amp;#39;t we been through enough for one day Jesus [ __ ] Christ remember the last time we had a working car and sat around on our CL I&amp;#39;m going it&amp;#39;s for one night brother it&amp;#39;s one night it&amp;#39;s not the end of everything I promise God damn it you can&amp;#39;t just walk away from us you better talk some s yeah I keep having to do that lately for his sake right shelter and food you mean like all the other like weird towns that were supposed to be safe havens that we just went to and it was just like death and sadness all the way around damn it stupid [ __ ] get the [ __ ] out of here it&amp;#39;s me clam sorry just give me a second how close the door can you believe this Clen I bring them a working truck and they act like I just [ __ ] in their seral I knew Jane had have a stick up her ass but I thought at least Mike could have more sense they&amp;#39;re scared of you Kenny well their big plan is to wander around in the woods they ought to be scared of more than me did you hear me we&amp;#39;re all scared look we got maybe a day&amp;#39;s worth of food for that kid left that&amp;#39;s it Clen think about Rebecca and Alvin I mean what if Lee hadn&amp;#39;t gone tearing across half of Georgia looking for you a lot of folks died to make that happen a lot of folks died to get us this far I know you&amp;#39;re right someone&amp;#39;s got to keep this group together that kid&amp;#39;s depending on us I wish Lee was here yeah me too what you think he&amp;#39;d say I think he&amp;#39;d tell me to try to keep the group together and that we should keep moving yep it&amp;#39;s pretty accurate right we can&amp;#39;t just give up on this kid I mean what&amp;#39;s the point of going on after that that&amp;#39;s what people like Lee knew and what people like Jane won&amp;#39;t ever understand she came back for me she&amp;#39;s starting to get I know Willington might be [ __ ] but where there&amp;#39;s smoke there&amp;#39;s fire yeah that&amp;#39;s what you talking about about right you know when I first saw you back at that Lodge thought I was dreaming likewise and when you sat down next to me and we shared that meal well I could tell that you

do that anyway why would she even put them in that situation there was no [ __ ] reason for that like at all like what was her what would no reason at all to do that like at all the baby around she

okay so like obviously I want to stay with Kenny like obviously that&amp;#39;s like the emotional choice but that&amp;#39;s not what&amp;#39;s best for this like like it&amp;#39;s really not right like it&amp;#39;s like there&amp;#39;s no way to to know that that&amp;#39;s like the safe option like that&amp;#39;s there there&amp;#39;s no way there&amp;#39;s like no way to know that that&amp;#39;s like safe for them at all like and if we uh like if we go with Kenny it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s just back to like like whatever the [ __ ] right just like praying we find [ __ ] instead of like well I guess we could take the supplies but that only last us so long and then we got to find something else I may not go with whatever you guys go with but I might pull this one because this is pretty painful see what do we do leave with Kenny all right I&amp;#39;m going to use the restroom real quick and uh I&amp;#39;ll see what you guys say the moment I come back that&amp;#39;s this is intense I don&amp;#39;t like this oh boy let&amp;#39;s see what we&amp;#39;re looking at here wow people are really saying go with Kenny oh I hate it oh I hate it it&amp;#39;s like I want what&amp;#39;s best for for AJ for the baby but I I realistically also want what&amp;#39;s best for uh I also want the best what&amp;#39;s best for Kenny too because Kenny has gone out of his way to take care of me over and over and over right like he has gone out of his way to take care of me as well over and over and over when he didn&amp;#39;t have to so like I don&amp;#39;t know I don&amp;#39;t know like maybe uh I don&amp;#39;t know he&amp;#39;s put out his he&amp;#39;s put out he&amp;#39;s put himself out there for me over and over and over and over and over when he didn&amp;#39;t have to yeah when he didn&amp;#39;t have to so I don&amp;#39;t know but still not with this game I don&amp;#39;t think you&amp;#39;ll make France people better than me no no we&amp;#39;re leaving all of us together CL please it&amp;#39;s safe here you need to think about the stop okay we&amp;#39;re not staying so just stop that sounds like sounds like she means business he is going to cry up here yeah yeah it does come on we&amp;#39;re leaving she gave extra supplies I&amp;#39;m only supposed to give out one per group look if you&amp;#39;re in the area check back in a few months we might be accepting people then thank you for the help and uh sorry for the language well it&amp;#39;s a shitty situation we&amp;#39;re all doing the best we can you all stay safe out there survive for her yeah a that the truth here is stubborn as a damn mule yeah wonder where I got that from uh Who ah [ __ ] who wonder who I got that from [Music] wow and that&amp;#39;s how that ends that&amp;#39;s crazy that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s crazy wow that&amp;#39;s that was OB was not good as ending of season one but that was pretty like that last time was actually pretty solid you% of players with M every Everybody almost mutually came out with huh almost everyone came out and was like what the what is happening only 33 play three 33% of players go to help Luke wow everybody&amp;#39;s like wanted Luke to die 21% players are now with Kenny whoa whoa I made the weird decision interesting only 21% of people went with him wow that is wow that is huh I really was the uh I really was the weirdo this season or this episode that uh that uh I I made some interesting decisions apparently the def Edition I mean I feel like with the defintive I feel like it would be more even just cuz people doing multiple playthroughs so like that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s [Music] nutty I&amp;#39;ve been uh skipping these a lot because I actually got uh not a copyright strike but I got um my V partially muted during that section because apparently that music isn&amp;#39;t just there for uh uh apparently that music is not copyright safe even though it&amp;#39;s in the game well there was a uh there was a DLC or something right for the season 2 there was something or another right remember hearing about that you can go and do that I just don&amp;#39;t know what it&amp;#39;s called because obviously I&amp;#39;m doing this blind the miniseries this uh why is it like at the back did this come out after season 2 yeah did this come out after season two or is this just kind of like a one-off thing yeah that I me we&amp;#39;ll play it [Music] for the comic series which I have not not read R into kind of M you play a little and see [Music] okay oh this is multi episode oh oh this is like a whole [Music] thing yeah this is like a whole thing I would almost make want to make this its own like play through it&amp;#39;s not like 400 Days where it&amp;#39;s just like a oneoff thing h yeah I didn&amp;#39;t know it was like a whole thing on its [Music] own also if that&amp;#39;s the case we might as well uh just uh I play after the finale it&amp;#39;s actually pretty long yeah that&amp;#39;s might be what we do CU like I was looking for something like kind of like uh 400 Days is um where it was um like kind of its own like short thing but if it&amp;#39;s going to be a whole like thing especially if it&amp;#39;s long we can do say that for later well um in terms of um some we start season 3 I mean I I would rather save that for its own thing and vote for it right cuz if we start season 3 we&amp;#39;re going to be playing season 3 and I don&amp;#39;t want to like if somebody wants if if if we we PLL it and people don&amp;#39;t end up wanting Walking Dead that&amp;#39;s going to be kind of awkward you know um so um I think I might just uh uh opt out here and do some just like DVD for like an hour or two simply speed stop uh and then we&amp;#39;ll vote on this next week in terms of my feelings about um uh Walking Dead Season 2 um3 making Chris hey hey there you go That Guy voices everybody make me grab water yo thanks I appreciate I&amp;#39;m also going to open Spotify yeah in terms of my feelings about uh season 2 um like it&amp;#39;s definitely a step down from season one and I guess in a lot of fairness um season one is like pretty much a masterpiece pretty much a masterpiece like season season one is like amazing and I can see why it got as much uh as much attention and love as it did CU like that it was emotional it was good the writing was good it was just great all around it was it was just great like there really is new uh there really was no uh like I feel like it was just yeah like I don&amp;#39;t know how to say it just it was just good all around um but like season 2 was clearly a step down and I don&amp;#39;t think it was was bad like literally at all I don&amp;#39;t think it was bad literally at all um but uh it definitely like like like I said the main thing that was bothering me most of the time in like season 2 was that almost everything was a non-choice almost all of it was a non-choice like uh somebody said earlier and I thought this was really smart uh that most of the choices like were just ways to change dialogue and not ways to actually change the plot of the story it felt like nothing I said or did mattered at all until episode 5 like when episode 5 picked in there&amp;#39;s actually a lot of good emotional moments and like choices that mattered and stuff but like the most of the uh most of the um most of the stuff in the uh most of the stuff in the uh in the episodes before that were like like we said just like dial like diog would change but even if I ended up like saving a specific character they kind of just like fell into the background yeah exactly like you just you just said it like you took the words out my mouth fire like saving Nick and Sarah literally does nothing like literally nothing like they just fall into the background it&amp;#39;s like you didn&amp;#39;t save them at all anyway you know red yeah it&amp;#39;s just like it felt like just like nothing I didn&amp;#39;t mattered like at all and obviously in a in a game where the only gameplay choices like the only thing to do in the game is is to make choices that affect and see how they affect the story it&amp;#39;s kind of annoying right like the whole game is based off the premise of like like you know the butterfly effect and like the things you say and do change the outcome but when they just don&amp;#39;t it&amp;#39;s kind of just like just doesn&amp;#39;t matter yeah exactly like even though I did the right thing to not take ARA&amp;#39;s medicine like I like the the it essentially played out the exact same it wasn&amp;#39;t programmed to harm the crew",

loading again there we go you gaming getting a cow that&amp;#39;s what my uh my sister needs to do that soon my brother has one but my sister do not to the ground Bill I&amp;#39;m the oldest of three so they they are still getting a lot of their stuff still set up for life and [Music] things so we have to stop this killer train or something from like ruining Wonderland and we keep like porting back to real life in between that&amp;#39;s essentially the plot so far we just run into a very verying different iconic Al Wonderland characters going ah the train is yes who is it the train is killing us a you&amp;#39;re back I suppose you better come home we haven&amp;#39;t find any solid ways to deal with it [Music] I feel like most of the budget for this game went to the [ __ ] hair physics which do not surprised me a bit the Harry Potter ass music happening right [Music] now Oh you mean like while you&amp;#39;re streaming that&amp;#39;s kind of scary Radcliff Daniel Radcliff oh no all those people that keep samurai swords around the [Music] house so he&amp;#39;s in there kind hey B my friend how are you yeah that was a death moment you just came in with [Music] YY well more people speaking your language you do have my rabbit forgotten your manners and what else I wonder you abandoned it at rutage Asylum my dear we&amp;#39;ve been over this before in a huff as usual oozing with attitude and accusatory flamy I&amp;#39;ve stolen her rabbit ridiculous pretext she&amp;#39;s here about the fire again all the mad child wants to talk about my report found her family dead by misadventure Adventure she won&amp;#39;t accept it goes on and on about her killing memories and her need to know the truth the alleged truth is the fire began in the library when you can set your uh mic in OBS to be on a hot that probably help a lot sister lizy never even unlocked her door died in her bed the guilty cat that&amp;#39;s one of the best parts about having M mous and streaming is that I can just set to side of my M I have like didn&amp;#39;t mean to skip that but uh I can be like oh you need a zoom in zoom in did I rip his head off I you want Bon boy to say something hi there you go easy peasy yeah what&amp;#39;s left of my something real Qui explod which one&amp;#39;s that there we go is it mad to pray for better hallucinations you can set things to hot fed to expire right here [Music] play with PS5 ah gotcha so how do you do your editing then that you upload to your YouTube and stuff if you only have a A PS5 how&amp;#39;s that work I&amp;#39;m [Music] curious music&amp;#39;s nice you know what&amp;#39;s funny about that uh with the burping and the coughing that&amp;#39;s why I like a lot of my like that&amp;#39;s like the number one reason for like jump Cuts in my YouTube videos because I either run out of breath I for like I&amp;#39;m just like I go to I start talking I go where was I going with that point it&amp;#39;s like burp sneeze cough or like just kind of like Zing out on accident usually what&amp;#39;s responsible for my jump cuts [Music] only recordings how here Lan how&amp;#39;s it going [Music] friends you didn&amp;#39;t come in with the uh the dance song I was kind of like about say there it is Phantom always likes to use the uh Deadly Premonition song and that&amp;#39;s like your song that&amp;#39;s how I know that you V you guys are wrestlers wrestlers you have you you have entrance D like wrestlers oh that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s good I can&amp;#39;t jump or anything I&amp;#39;m still in like real life mode even though like shit&amp;#39;s getting crazy yep there&amp;#39;s the killer traino okay there we go corrup yeah we played for about 6 hours last time you saw us play World perhaps things only this is telling me I&amp;#39;m like going to be doing the game in third at this point I&amp;#39;m not that stupid but something a bit less would have yeah that&amp;#39;s true Charles this is the mitigated disaster and it will get worse your train keeps a henish sched get moving time waits for no one the change has begun the train is perfect capable of terrifying me cat you should find another job is there really so little hope there&amp;#39;s even less and if fear paralyzes you we are lost oh my gosh okay I need to remember the controls uh oh the game stopped yeah the game stopped responding I paused the game and it stopped responding oh yep it okay it heart crashed I just wanted to check the controls really quick I was like ah it&amp;#39;s been it&amp;#39;s been a bit since I played the game um I would like to check the controls real quick uh before I get into the combat and uh it hard crash and said video game yeah it&amp;#39;s been a last week uh it wasn&amp;#39;t functioning cuz it just wasn&amp;#39;t playing nice with the game capture um this week it&amp;#39;s just like not responding a lot it keeps not responding for some [Music] reason capture cards are expensive very very expensive that&amp;#39;s why I never streamed anything off my switch back in the day that&amp;#39;s how I do that so just hold right for that do like the gy that&amp;#39;s fun okay is that ow okay um R is the search weapon right yes it is okay I did like the big see there&amp;#39;s an umbrella how do I lock on again well tabber oh it&amp;#39;s I do I don&amp;#39;t want to check the controls again that got me in trouble last time oh uh maybe okay there we go configuration I want to you can&amp;#39;t check the controls without the game crashing I just want I just want to play holy [ __ ] oh no that&amp;#39;s funny oh man [Music] okay okay okay maybe there&amp;#39;s a way to check in the menu so I can stop crashing the video game okay where&amp;#39;s my [Music] umbrella a left control focus is caps lock [Music] okay umbrella block is e okay so it&amp;#39;s e e okay okay oh let&amp;#39;s try this the third time don&amp;#39;t don&amp;#39;t check the controls for any reason yeah don&amp;#39;t check the controls for any reason oh I got I just took all that gosh don&amp;#39;t last time okay that&amp;#39;s the good part about this thing is that I don&amp;#39;t need to wait for him to do the thing cuz my hammer is strong enough I love how the genon fight in the Forest Temple and like aaring a time just went on to inspire like so many different like enemy and Boss Designs it&amp;#39;s so funny was that the there was a fight with G in the AAR you know that did that exact mechanic where you have to reflect it back at him and then every game for the rest of humanity just like like that&amp;#39;s a good idea I want to do that too interesting oh nice here I was just looking I have a they&amp;#39;re doing a weed journey of Miles begins with a single step single step off London Bridge could end my journey failure your EP a boss fight true we already pointed out several times this game is kind of like uh the uh Legend of Zelda you have a home just got an Alice Wonderland skin over which is if you&amp;#39;re going to emate the game like good one to pick this is interesting oh is it you guys were recommending that game too for The Saturdays plugs why is the ambient so much louder than like the game noise I don&amp;#39;t have to deal with I just never played Hollow Knight I love souls games but I&amp;#39;m not a Souls like games I&amp;#39;ve never really gotten into like there&amp;#39;s like enough actual like Souls boring content that like I don&amp;#39;t need to do like like Soul&amp;#39;s likes get the same experience you know that vaporous ledge only appears as flimsy and insubstantial as your confidence it will hold you AHS right a few misses where are some of the good ones also how&amp;#39;s it going man where am I heading okay here right all night&amp;#39;s one of them yeah a lot of people in h night lot of people that&amp;#39;s the side scroller one yeah I&amp;#39;ve heard of that comparison too scar it&amp;#39;s like a Metroid Vania that&amp;#39;s more op comparison I&amp;#39;ve heard that too I&amp;#39;ve never been into like Metroid Vania kind of games I know it&amp;#39;s kind of a weird thing a lot of people love like those kind of games but they never really appeal to me for some reason yeah code ban I&amp;#39;ve heard of code V too Neo I&amp;#39;ve heard of Neo Neo like Neo Neo does the presence of Neo imply the the existence of o or fedo uhuh the teapot we were just I was just looking at this before stream started is that I was missing a weapon in my collection this is itot Cannon okay oh Mouse wheel okay I got bombs that&amp;#39;s very slow and just PE PE I guess there&amp;#39;s like like a big boss or a giant group that&amp;#39;ll be helpful but enemies are pretty fast in this game they don&amp;#39;t really stay congregated very much where how slow that is okay if you shoot it like straight down though to go off this big boys well I have to deal with these guys oh that&amp;#39;s right this is the one that aggravated me at the camera yeah this is the one that if you lock on it&amp;#39;s really hard to [ __ ] fight him yeah cuz like he runs so fast that he like ends up like going off screen and then when he goes off screen you can&amp;#39;t or like you can&amp;#39;t if he&amp;#39;s not you can&amp;#39;t see which way he&amp;#39;s facing he has a grab move that like that that just gets you yeah like right now like you got to stay out of his arm length but you got to keep an eye on him to do it but the camera just locks onto him in general and doesn&amp;#39;t like yeah doesn&amp;#39;t let you keep an eye on where he is grabbing oh oh cool the corner of the Arena yeah the corner of the Arena right there I don&amp;#39;t think that actually hit me I think the game why would you dash towards them Alice do that to see Z back there hopefully you&amp;#39;re well your Saturday treating oh he he his doesn&amp;#39;t let you do that oh oh that&amp;#39;s new that&amp;#39;s new that&amp;#39;s scary oh go get away hey Beast it&amp;#39;s good to see you friend ow you&amp;#39;re well oh my gosh that&amp;#39;s terrifying um good bet the lock on system hurts more than it helps like half the time I&amp;#39;m using it I think the camera is just like not very intuitive to oh my oh oh oh Alice go away from the guy that is actively trying to kill you why does the game want me to like Dodge into stop Dodge away from the thing that&amp;#39;s actively trying to kill you don&amp;#39;t Dodge into him yeah I don&amp;#39;t know why Alice chooses to Loop into the person that she&amp;#39;s trying that actually trying to hit her but it is not good okay did you finally die that was really problematic not because of him but because of the camera the camera was not very uh uh intuitive SP tee I&amp;#39;m afraid to bring up the menu I&amp;#39;m afraid uh for those of you who just got here the game has been crashing like every single time I bring up the menu and try to access something so uh I&amp;#39;m kind of scared to do that I do want to continue to upgrade my stuff though hey Justice it&amp;#39;s good to see you life is treating you in the world on a [ __ ] please don&amp;#39;t crash how do I we made it without crashing we made it the controls let&amp;#39;s see uh is it in this menu you I&amp;#39;m living controls were locked behind a boss you had to do the boss first weapons here we go uh 700 for that our next upgrade would be the teapot cannon at 525 and I almost have enough for that keep that in mind oh on hello hello I can&amp;#39;t break that one bugs I will say the pepper grinder is probably my favorite weapon it&amp;#39;s very fun I just like you few things just feels good I&amp;#39;m [Music] overheated I&amp;#39;m on the edge of glory you know and break this stuff down here make sure thiefs hey my dumbass brain was like I wonder if they could it about put a gun into a dead by daylight and I was like well the death linger that character you liked a lot for a long time that guy oh yeah it was miles away it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s really fun too it&amp;#39;s just like really satisfying weapon to use assault Seeker for Slugs oh my gosh that makes so much sense genous your Genius is showing catastrophe May strike even the best regulated catastrophe of course one family&amp;#39;s disaster may be another family&amp;#39;s opportunity and same goes for surviving family member if you know what I mean you know I mean I I don&amp;#39;t I&amp;#39;m devastated look what&amp;#39;s become of my beautiful oh by the way chat those are you dbd andies I finally finished last night I grinded for like 6 hours got every single General tile and how to loop at a xenomorph done yesterday so now map to your list and we&amp;#39;re done so probably like one or two nights will work more gu will be in pretty high did you just kill your own guy oh not him not him yep I had to take that hit because had to take that hit because the system wanted me to aim the the tiny slug not the thing that was AC know throwing something dangerous at me on the hor so satisfying but it&amp;#39;s so [ __ ] slow that was very quick yeah oh yep functional camera holy [ __ ] can I see the guy that&amp;#39;s actively trying to hit me hi Dino how&amp;#39;s it going okay we should have enough to get our teapot already leveled up she was censored yeah that&amp;#39;s her I don&amp;#39;t even know her now we out for a good bit I still don&amp;#39;t like how suggested the way they kind of like get excited explos ambros see you friend hope you&amp;#39;re well solo you had fun nice not something I often enjoy by what the point coming up here funny story that actually happened what do you mean just like in general look at my life dude probably need something a little bit more paic what&amp;#39;s the point of going up there yeah am I missing something we unlock this platform but like going up here actually there&amp;#39;s like nothing oh I see there we go wait I see the door he CH I BL these up with the thing maybe e no I guess aible wall right there I think so s could be fun just in the sense of just like absolute chaos like there there are chances you get good team but there also chances you get absolute idiots kind of like the RNG of it is like kind of like the fun part you know it&amp;#39;s like wow anything can happen you know yeah I can see the door back there but I guess until we find a way to clear out these guys usually with these kind of situations you just shoot the head and the thing goes away I guess these guys go away in some sort of special way that I have not learned or dealt with yeah just play killer if I&amp;#39;m playing alone yeah I wish I really do wish more people could find killer rocking as I do it&amp;#39;s just a Vibe for me people see it so stressfully and it just actually wish things were different they can see how it can be a more relxing room yeah like I generally aim to win but winning is not always the goal like winning is not the only way to have fun for me it&amp;#39;s just generally something I attempt to do if it doesn&amp;#39;t up working out working out oh I got to break it first that&amp;#39;s right it is what it is if it doesn&amp;#39;t work out you know okay I was like kind of worried I couldn&amp;#39;t make that one this guys I just like very passionately oh ow which is why that range to break the wall which one oh this one [Music] got him just anxiety playing the role sometimes yeah it&amp;#39;s one of those things though that like the more you play it the better it gets too you just have to get used to things I think that&amp;#39;s one of the wonderful things like like now that I&amp;#39;m done with like the tile thing on the guide like I can just like like it helps like lower a lot of that stress I think cuz like just generally know how to loot like every tile holy [ __ ] can I really wish very minor I wish that like Alice would like in instinctually Dodge away from the things that are trying to hit her but she just kind of dodges wherever she pleases which lead to these situations where she&amp;#39;s like you know where I&amp;#39;m saying I&amp;#39;m like you dodge straight into something and it can still hit you so it&amp;#39;s not even like truly a Dodge cuz you&amp;#39;re just still in r range for whatever attack is coming your way it&amp;#39;s just kind of frustrating that gets me hurt quite a lot in this game there&amp;#39;s new tiles on the new map I only do General tiles in the guide so like tiles that appear on three or more maps so if the tile is still fairly new I don&amp;#39;t actually have to be over here to do that I just kind of say hey those will be added in time as more maps get them if you want like specific advice on how to Loop a specific tile just let me know I will do it but I just for now did okay I just for out go this but see like the lockout system is kind of required to deal with certain enemies but it&amp;#39;s very bad house thank you yeah I just kind of did tiles that show up uh on at least three Maps or more and we&amp;#39;ll do the individual ones as people need them the map specific ones I dodge just kind of house was not fast enough to beat him I pressed it I anticipated it full metal Alice full metal Al alist I don&amp;#39;t know that works on out yeah for the purpose of the guy I only did piles that appear on like three or more maps and I&amp;#39;ll just add the the very very unique ones as we go as they appear or as people ask for them cuz like if I was going to cover every single possible tile in the game like the guide would be like 400 pages long um it is already longer than the clown guide and I&amp;#39;m already uncomfortable about that so like I&amp;#39;m trying to find ways to condense it so yeah yeah and I still have to do the map tier list cuz that&amp;#39;s like the last section I got to do so um it&amp;#39;s still going to increase in length I thought it was crashing can no please seems devs It&amp;#39;s kind of just useless like even M1 characters can play that tile fairly well like I also got kind of scared when I first saw that thing I realized that it was like it&amp;#39;s short it&amp;#39;s extremely short on both sides so you can just kind of circumvent it pretty easily specific trees of Forman how about the trees from McMillan dude there are people that ask that like unironically I I not looking for that what are you aiming at just to practicing and playing yeah cuz once you it&amp;#39;s like you got to get into the Motions right you got to get kind of an autopilot with it make a lot of stuff that is in the foreground of your brain back ground it&amp;#39;s not something you&amp;#39;re like actively thinking about and worrying about and that&amp;#39;s where like a lot of the funing killer comes through which is why I started the match review series that way I can like help people like realize the stuff that they&amp;#39;re they should be doing they&amp;#39;re not doing that way they can kind of get that autopilot going have like a more casual time on the rooll yeah I like the horse but it&amp;#39;s really bad against fast enemies fast enemies just your ass one in a while but they&amp;#39;re always there I don&amp;#39;t plan to stop doing them anytime soon hey asle yeah it&amp;#39;s Alice madness Returns it&amp;#39;s kind of like a like a Legend of Zelda clone but like edgy and Alice and Wonderland a mix that you never thought you would hear but there it is Hope be day oh I see I got to go down J are obnoxious I agree like I know Wesker Chase music is really good but sometimes it&amp;#39;s really obnoxious how loud it is oh mind me I meant to sit in that all right that&amp;#39;s good accept voice for my soul yeah I&amp;#39;ve seen a lot of people that like love this game say that they&amp;#39;re really sad we&amp;#39;ll never get another one either but stream not a clone I mean in a lot of ways it is in a lot of ways it&amp;#39;s not it&amp;#39;s heavily barring it from it I mean like down to even like this lock on system with the eye thing like that&amp;#39;s very Legend Zelda why did you just land on nothing hello is this another Behavior game no not that I&amp;#39;m aware of though not think so yeah I agree decep a lot of people do exaggerate how bad the game is but I&amp;#39;ve kind of come to realize that in fighting that fight to have people be a little bit more like realistic about how the game actually is like I&amp;#39;m not making a lot of friends I don&amp;#39;t I feel about that uh [Music] i&amp;#39;ve smoked a cigarette Alice no fun at all you you do know you like the windshield wiper Chase reason that what you like say long it&amp;#39;s because I love your video oh I me okay so when I made that comment I know what you&amp;#39;re talking about about like people writing essays it&amp;#39;s like if you&amp;#39;re really passionate about something you&amp;#39;re just popping off like by all means you to you fam but like it&amp;#39;s like the egregious like I hate everything and DVD is a failure and you make me mad because you said DVD is not a failure like just be like like yelling and complaining for that long like I&amp;#39;m like are you okay the sight the stink the Sinister sound imag Alice oh there a big boy over there oh I hate those guys I up finding the camera more I am fighting this dude well he&amp;#39;s got the [ __ ] squid guys up there I wish I could aim directly at them come on open up I want to deal with you before I have to fight that guy cuz you guys will make my day miserable while trying to fight him more oh hello answer my question real quick you do have another one I hate these things get out of camera mode so I can actually fight this guy you got to attack the little like little mask guys on him oh all right that that works I&amp;#39;m fine with this yeah I even if you don&amp;#39;t think the behavior is doing like quote unquote good like they have improved so much which I&amp;#39;m very happy about there no damage on strats been years DD yeah it&amp;#39;s been a long time going a long time kind of funny they&amp;#39;re having their vors at the tail end of their life cycle what&amp;#39;s funny too is I already saw that the killer clowns uh Twitter was posting on like hey humans could be bullies too and I&amp;#39;m like oh that&amp;#39;s a good start survivors can already bully the killer oh my gosh that just went through the wall I guess I&amp;#39;ve been choosing you this entire time so that&amp;#39;s fair you just ch me back just take it easy man oh he went around the pole he&amp;#39;s cheating okay this just goes everywhere I guess even if there&amp;#39;s something in the way actively this funny is a baby mask be too optimistic yeah being realistic is probably the best way to be about things like that what I try to be oh see like she she just Dodges into the enemy sometimes and I wish she wouldn&amp;#39;t why are you dodging into the enemy Alice like holy [ __ ] move away from the thing that&amp;#39;s actively trying to hurt you that whenever he does this I&amp;#39;m just going to like yeah uh Rainbow Six Siege had a a project Health patch update and it like really did save the game and kept it going they really should take give some thought to doing that as well okay this is the problem with this trat is now whenever they go down they staying inside the rock the Dwayne The Rock Johnson I know that&amp;#39;s F The Rock just been back in wrestling recently tooo kind of weird yeah I would to do know the problem is that like it&amp;#39;s a short-sided decision right cuz if they did a project called fch more people would play the game in the long term but in the short term they make zero money off of that so that&amp;#39;s probably why they don&amp;#39;t want to do it that&amp;#39;s a lot of effort for like no no um no return it&amp;#39;s not only about you Ellis look at the destruction around you consider its C then come join me this one the rock eating rocks no I&amp;#39;m not he time I get out of this again let me go let me go um nothing is getting me out um hello it&amp;#39;s not letting me go please I&amp;#39;m hitting everything is there a secret control to exit this I&amp;#39;m missing cuz I don&amp;#39;t think so I don&amp;#39;t think so okay okay I just had to pause a bunch like whatever video game you can I just make that yeah was like waiting for the platform to come down we&amp;#39;re fine yeah we just had to unpause and repa the game over and over until it like let me go little relinquish foror Alice no oh it just starts me back over here okay while deceptive uh if I keep up so I&amp;#39;m probably going to work on the Guide tonight I just try do the map cheerless stuff um I&amp;#39;ll probably have that out like this week or next week cuzz like literally doing the map tier list is the last thing I got to do then it&amp;#39;s just making the index wait I just jumped off again I did the exact same thing sorry that&amp;#39;s what I get for uh looking at chat while playing um do the map tier list and then it&amp;#39;s just making the index making sure the links work uh that sort of thing frame rate drop oh my we good yeah then we&amp;#39;re good arain is actually not F tier because there&amp;#39;s actually a lot of ways you can play the main house that is not possible on uh where the [ __ ] am I now where am I now um okay I fell and died and it put me somewhere weird oh it&amp;#39;s the other end of this this okay that&amp;#39;s why I was like what the hell is happening please let me go next time okay thank you how many pages is it so far if you don&amp;#39;t mind me saying uh like 207 something like that okay this time I need to make sure that I over to that place I just BL you know what&amp;#39;s funny deceptive how feel was initially going to have Sha but it never made it to live we doing the clim way not on purpose but I&amp;#39;m going to try to condense it too skin burn the fire I looks wrinkled like a to myen so far in Winter a map have a sha just awful one true yes it does functionally in the game files kind of sha even though it&amp;#39;s not really sha it&amp;#39;s it doesn&amp;#39;t have the same resources that sha does I&amp;#39;m theor it would really would be on the outside not the inside interesting that I did not know about when you sat down and work on the guide did you saw how many pages I were in uh actually no usually it&amp;#39;s not until like Liz asks or like somebody asks me when I mentioned working on it that they&amp;#39;re like oh how many pages I&amp;#39;m like oh it&amp;#39;s a it&amp;#39;s so and so pages that just it let just cap right yeah that hatch offering for Shaq does work on Z this map so if you bring a hatch at Shaq it will spawn at that little shuttle at the back of the map but despite not having the same resources as Sha it functionally is sha according to the game which is interesting May it&amp;#39;s kind of not good yeah it also runs really really ages are all your videos comb what do you mean Pages am I missing something video videos are not Pages videos are in a video format minutes seconds hours sorry for the flashbang did not see that coming scrip Pages uh not to brush your bubble I I don&amp;#39;t scrip my videos familiar with the saying that smoking stunts your at most I have like AET children with that adage usually while they&amp;#39;ve got a pipe stuck in their mouths I won&amp;#39;t ask you to inhale Let the Smoke envelop you I don&amp;#39;t know how to answer that question you want your videos to be a book how many pages of video I don&amp;#39;t know W this place is interesting mysteriously there&amp;#39;s just flying coni in the a grass oh that is pretty I&amp;#39;m glad you addressed that oh that does look nice as inspired level was not on my uh a Wonderland Bingo but like here we are [Music] yeah it&amp;#39;s this is my favorite one so far the steam punk one the steampunk one is also very nice but Absol B I don&amp;#39;t know about that I thank you get over there oh what is that thing [Music] fish taking your chain I remember what the even looks like that that area was kind of like repetitive and annoying that&amp;#39;s probably my least favorite level in the game so far wh Mar what Wall-E how you spell that like WALL-E WALL-E you don&amp;#39;t [Music] like I want that one best you wa that&amp;#39;s concerning I hear a stinky [Music] boy oh yeah that I think the main thing that bothered me about that specifically was just like the fact that it made me fight the same boss five times with like no reward and then we also had our first like actual game breaking bug there which you know certainly didn&amp;#39;t help things okay oh I see I was like how that help us uh whoever said true art serves neither ornament nor use is ignorant of the athetic of the East Len aesthetic try not to like bounce immediately back up kind of want to get over there the music kind of do be raiding on my ears after a while not going to lie oh it&amp;#39;s just yelling at me I&amp;#39;m just supposed to just jump from here instead of like doing the uh mushroom thing but the mushroom thing was way more fun I wish the bottles functionally did something besides just being like a collect theong item then again I&amp;#39;m never one of those people that has been into collectons just like I like I like collecting something to be worth something like with the memories the memories are cool because I get a little bit of lower little bit voice you know the balls was little just like nothing all right rest well scare thank you for hanging it does kind of have that Maro Galaxy energy done it that is true wow we used to be a true culture our games used to have double jumps what happened to us [Music] where back up to 340 Dodson is a pathetic sailor and an even worse a Sean if you will we&amp;#39;d have run a ground on the Isis if I hadn&amp;#39;t taken an or [Music] I mean geralt in general needed the opposite he falls like a foot in Wich three and he [ __ ] dies he needed like like a feather fall or something so he wouldn&amp;#39;t just break his ankles by Falling a foot and a half there&amp;#39;s an angry guy on the wall there there&amp;#39;s Phantom see fissan is the totha song Phantom is the de per song nearly 100 is that why is that the the lore explanation for why he can fall a foot and break his ankles die so here what I&amp;#39;m happy to have you here doing a lot lot this guy is witness said was fire pushed in lit up like the guy on cracker KN no one knows how she survived except Alice and she&amp;#39;s St remember yeah I was doing a call play through with my child best friend super fun trying to just trying to coordinate how we&amp;#39;re going to handle certain encounters was always like a really fun Samurai L sounds like a problem oh God there&amp;#39;s more oh really am here oh wait there&amp;#39;s more oh you can break that little masks off that&amp;#39;s cool nice little touch Hey Oh okay that&amp;#39;s a wind up attack this is be true this game is making me anxious [Music] man he go out there we&amp;#39;ll be right back that be a sound alert problem being is that we already have all of our free sound alerts taken so i&amp;#39; have to remove something find something we don&amp;#39;t use very much yank in your chain what happened to being still I thinking that game is really good like really really strong oh um you know this game is something oh more people that&amp;#39;s another thing is that like the problem with the horse is that like if you&amp;#39;re already locked into attack and you can&amp;#39;t stop it as easily as with like the knife so you&amp;#39;re just going to like hose okay is making up its mind like can you stand here or can you not nope you cannot what a viewer dream to watch yeah by the way the the main theme of this game is that uh I&amp;#39;m trying to stop a giant angry cathedral train from destroying Wonderland um if you could not gather that from the things that are happening in the game uh I do not blame you because despite it being incredbly uh incredibly uh perilous and immediate threat uh we do spend a tremendous amount of time just [ __ ] around instead it&amp;#39;s kind of funny like the sense of urgency is not there certain smells are one off you&amp;#39;d never mistake burning human flesh for roasting a lamb chop oh was that common knowledge my bad sorry yeah if anything I&amp;#39;ve attacked more things Wonderland than the [ __ ] train has am I the [ __ ] Menace am I the bad guy there&amp;#39;s probably some [ __ ] like video essay out there oh oh suddenly fire how Alice is the True Villain and Alice manness returns 3 hours and 4 minutes going to you going to go you going to go or just keep him until he goes that makes all killers manad see oh those have a very long wind up time J with a Walmart mic yeah I like Alice mandis returns those of you growing up on the on the what it 360 came out on back in the 360 there was this little game that had so much charm called Alice madness Returns but you may not be the protagonist you think you are you may in fact be the antagonist thank you for watching today&amp;#39;s video today we will be discussing how Alice is actually the main villain of Alice maners RS before we get started this video is sponsored by Squarespace if you use code madness Returns you can get 400% off on your next order of your website there we go I almost probably exactly explained the video that actually exists she who saves a single soul saves the universe remember do you remember I judge you based off of what comes next after that because there&amp;#39;s so many different songs that&amp;#39;s in whoa big angry boy look at that it&amp;#39;s angry clock oh that&amp;#39;s interesting it&amp;#39;s kind of okay oh take off all like okay so even if you dodge is attacks all around himself you just got to like unlock the camera and just run the hell away hello I say that all the time you know what&amp;#39;s funny you know what&amp;#39;s really [ __ ] funny I was uh I used to experiment with doing like let&amp;#39;s play content on the YouTube before I fully pivoted into being only a DVD content creator um and there&amp;#39;s actually oh it&amp;#39;s right here right in front of me it just looked like it was part of the decorations um and there was one of those videos I was playing of an indie horror game and I was like I wonder how many drugs they did while they were making this game developer actually comes into the YouTube comments is like uh none actually I was like sorry [Music] I also had another funny one there was a uh indie horror game where the M the music like that was playing during the game was just like exorbitantly loud I was like I it&amp;#39;s hard to focus cuz this music is just blaring at like 200% volume and the composer for the song YouTube and like uh the song&amp;#39;s actually fine it&amp;#39;s just the it&amp;#39;s just the audio it&amp;#39;s just it&amp;#39;s just raised too high so the song isn&amp;#39;t bad it&amp;#39;s just the audio I&amp;#39;m like don&amp;#39;t I don&amp;#39;t remember candy fing hey kaer how&amp;#39;s it going how you friend we well in the today Zone we&amp;#39;ll keep just the one lamp Alice as a nightlight but it stays in the upstairs H and only wow they&amp;#39;re using [Music] is she the massive video I would ask you what it&amp;#39;s about but no spoilers speak with the Elder yes you really must he knows things he even thinks things righted alert freeth thinker or the boas linking at me oh I jumped off and I went to jump back and there was an invisible wall exactly where I jumped off like oh oh he&amp;#39;s invisible over two hours long jesz p that do be a long time I&amp;#39;m inged to see what get you rambling for that long oh hi thank you oh another slide puzzle your Victory is in combat and conundra suggest your Fitness to confront the challenges ahead mental strength will confirm your worthiness or declare your defeat I do declare I hate the like I&amp;#39;m glad this is something that&amp;#39;s kind of like on the way to the doo when it comes to like do game design it&amp;#39;s like technically they could just let us through this door and have us go to the next section instead it&amp;#39;s just going to put like 40 roblocks in the way like we now we have to stop and gather like all these parts of the puzzle and then do the slide puzzle actually gather all the parts even back in the day it it still came off as padding and now especially in 2024 this stuff really comes off as padding so was just kind of like I&amp;#39;m glad that modern games don&amp;#39;t really do this you can argue that more modern games are like more handh holdy in that regard they&amp;#39;re a little bit less interesting I something be a little bit more handh holdy than like I don&amp;#39;t know or side quests that I don&amp;#39;t [Music] enjoy yeah bers gate is cool cuz like the ways you handle situations are so like flexible and creative when I&amp;#39;m in situations like this in like an old game it&amp;#39;s very clearly like oh roadblock you&amp;#39;re not allowed to play anymore you got to you got to pay you got to pay the the toll to get through and the toll is run around and do a bunch of other stuff oh you can actually walk in this water samur fly that&amp;#39;s probably the meme they were going for and I it took me a second to realize oops okay oh that was okay not Alice please holy mly hey slide puzzle unlocked I&amp;#39;m just here now okay do we have to do in a certain number of moves yeah only there ledge grabing yeah that would just easily save everything not that really loud music that was here earlier is like was only there for like one area almost missed this block because the camera yed to it that&amp;#39;s not where I wanted to go to the puzzle yeah true no I&amp;#39;m not going off the beacon path just to get one tooth not happening I&amp;#39;ll be Toothless the wicked was play see AG upon us and control the Peaks to East and West you must defeat them to reach

this depiction of domestic Harmony and order the fruitful landscape encouraged industry tolerance and cooperation loving families flourished happy children dear friends grateful for their well-being lived for Generations the fck Super Mario looks different it does a sudden onslaught of alien broke their fragile bodies and nearly crushed their generous Spirits oh scary I like what bran 2 said last week this game was like what kind of game should I be and the the dev said [Music] yes oh everything is this is a death are see don&amp;#39;t know oh I jumped over that what do you mean okay I&amp;#39;ll have to jump extremely early it&amp;#39;s not going to enough to jump over the fireball you have to clear it entirely by like a [ __ ] meter or else it just snags you anyway I&amp;#39;m literally jumping over it like why do I have to clear it by like a [ __ ] mile for it to not catch there you go I good enough there you go yeah it&amp;#39;s going to do a little bit of everything okay [Music] I wasn&amp;#39;t even like remotely close to those spikes what like okay I&amp;#39;ll just write this down and jump last second nope apparently there&amp;#39;s an extra foot of face of those can get you massive hit Bo what the [ __ ] okay we just stuck here oh okay this goes up this yeah Behavior to sound Collision literally this is annoying I got to jump off early was this and I got to like yeah cuz those oh my [Music] God beher didn&amp;#39;t me make this game maybe maybe just it was right May we&amp;#39;re [Music] wrong I did all that for a single tooth that&amp;#39;s not worth it not worth it at all going be tiny yeah I spend money on those and they make my weapon stronger I guess we don&amp;#39;t get up on top of that I want to see if I could [Music] you&amp;#39;re odd been interesting oh my gosh I don&amp;#39;t like the creaking makes me kind of nervous oh that moved me why did that move [Music] me feels like that one game getting over it the [ __ ] pipe and the the pot and the hammer like do I fall if I fall do I fall like the beginning of level again that would be wor first exit Okay we did it I guess did I teleport I somewhere else now up yourself only the foolish believe suffering just wages for being different yeah what he [Music] said liing doorknobs is illegal on other planets thanks bud I forgot what the point of the segment was I feel like this kind the point of this game in general there is an overarching story but really you&amp;#39;re just playing the game for the game play here and you&amp;#39;re just like oh yeah there&amp;#39;s a plot going on I&amp;#39;m not just like mindlessly destroying things for no reason did just not work what the [ __ ] was that it just like refused to pick me up yeah that&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s supposed to happen it&amp;#39;s supposed to like grab you when you jump I just went through it like no not this time Alice I&amp;#39;ve carried you for the last time a beautiful honorable daughter would commemorate her deceased family in Marvel I know A Gifted sculpter with whom I might negotiate a commission are you trying to [ __ ] extort me for money for my dead family just destroying [ __ ] I I love Fallout so much oh fire fire fire bad oh just turn me inside out um what the [ __ ] is happening in this game this is a interesting experience got back flipped on one of those and then I was stocked for so long that I just died I&amp;#39;m the [ __ ] yeah Insurance in general is just kind of a scam unfortunately it&amp;#39;s just kind of like hey you need to pay into this because you&amp;#39;re required to but if you use it you get penalized which doesn&amp;#39;t make any sense oh that&amp;#39;s annoying yeah they try to cover as little as possible when you actually need them but force you to pay into them for forever oh I oh I can&amp;#39;t jump while walk on interesting I was just stuck there dealing with that oh my God okay yeah I off mine too I feel that what a statue neat good to know you think builds all these like floating platforms how these even hover I&amp;#39;m in The Soup Bar why you buying clothes at the Soup Store friendship oh sorry my bad that should been the obvious answer it I always think it&amp;#39;s weird when there&amp;#39;s just like any society there is like you are required to have ABC that&amp;#39;s like pay cuz like people like you sa as much money as possible but it&amp;#39;s like you were required to pay this like what are you going to pay that for me are you going to pay that for me cuz if it&amp;#39;s required you&amp;#39;re going to pay it right you&amp;#39;re going to pay it for me since like you&amp;#39;ve made it required right it&amp;#39;s like nope oh okay so it&amp;#39;s just I just have to spend money but you you&amp;#39;re you&amp;#39;re demanding me to spend the money but like you&amp;#39;re you&amp;#39;re not going to subsidize that in any way okay that makes sense it just doesn&amp;#39;t yeah get blasted death Mac and Chee them but I love chefs I remember that old commercial well just weird the world is greedy is what it is greedy and unath look out scy probably make that jump but I don&amp;#39;t want to die say unnecessary profit yeah I was I was like I was on Twitter earlier and there was like some [ __ ] dude selling his Mansion for 17 million I&amp;#39;m like just your house just your house is 17 million holy [ __ ] oh one these guys oh these are little hives and I have to break them I see it&amp;#39;s just it&amp;#39;s just a resk of the enemies from earlier um I am did you force me into that scenario just so you can do the tutorial because I was pressing shift I remember how to deal with these things like no you&amp;#39;re not allowed to do it until we tell you yeah I&amp;#39;m F of the people are just kind of like weird in general you think with the world being the way it is people would be uh a little more empathetic and understanding though everybody&amp;#39;s just trying to make it by but a lot people see that as a place to exort others for their own benefit recover from that quickly [Music] now I can go back and grab these to go over and deal with that was nness literally a wasp nness uh as soon as possible one of these things I how still the the underwater version even though it&amp;#39;s in a different area that&amp;#39;s interesting there&amp;#39;s no time to waste there&amp;#39;s no time at all kill or be kill Let Die de with these things first so they don&amp;#39;t respawn and cause me a lot of Havoc I deal with what&amp;#39;s left oh hi everybody my name is Mark and welcome to finance and Freddy&amp;#39;s M Pat retirement uh I never cared for mat Pat from the moment he was like uh is it a problem that uh that the director of Five Nights at Freddy&amp;#39;s Scott cofin uh supports a bunch of anti-lgbtq politicians and policy it&amp;#39;s not really a hard business to say like um what you&amp;#39;ve already missed the train I&amp;#39;ll leave it up to you at home what yeah he homie kind of lost me there I kind of didn&amp;#39;t care about him after that okay the stairs go up here we can&amp;#39;t interact thing that was a very wild take oh that&amp;#39;s why it was a very very like controversial issue so there&amp;#39;s like it was going to be really you&amp;#39;d be really hard pressed to find a u like a an answer that would have satisfied everybody but I don&amp;#39;t think no answer was the answer yeah but that&amp;#39;s like the thing that like you said that Phantom but like that&amp;#39;s where I think I don&amp;#39;t like his response cuz it was very much like self-serving to be like yeah I should probably be responsible and tell my community that that was bad but homies set did the most like non- condemning response so he could benefit as much as possible which was not my [Music] favorite yeah cuz he&amp;#39;s definitely in like uh like a hard place there cuz if he does say yeah that was shitty of Scott to do and it really hurts cuz there&amp;#39;s a lot lot of lgbtq plus people in the FNAF community that sucks then like he angers the FNAF community that he has been you know for you know better or worse making tons and tons of money off for years um which just kind of shooting his own profits in the foot um and on the flip side if he says oh yeah that&amp;#39;s totally okay like once again you can&amp;#39;t say that when you&amp;#39;re not like a person being affected by set issues and it&amp;#39;s just being completely toned deaf so he just kind of didn&amp;#39;t go with you their response where the Penguins I jack knew what I was doing you know I was never one of those kids that threw them off I know that&amp;#39;s like the beam now I was like yeah we remember throwing the Penguins off the ledge in Mario 64 I&amp;#39;m sorry that was like never me okay it just threw me into nothing n dbd would be unlikely well essentially like For Better or Worse nobody really that nobody really cared about that kind of sucked but like essentially nobody really uh I guess I guess animatronic robot more important than people I don&amp;#39;t know but that essentially got swept under the rug very very quickly it didn&amp;#39;t really affect much I think it&amp;#39;s a pretty big deal I&amp;#39;m not a fan that that was just kind of swept under the rug oh that didn&amp;#39;t even reach that on to my [ __ ] yeah it&amp;#39;s like it&amp;#39;s it just kind of feels I know Zan will agree with that it just kind of feels like a well this issue doesn&amp;#39;t affect me so I don&amp;#39;t have to worry about it kind of things you know well Scott is retired to my understanding so technically it&amp;#39;s like whatever in terms of getting the license and DB or something to that extent you agree with you yeah I mean I think that it&amp;#39;s like being attacked in the cut scene and I&amp;#39;m not able to move I always have a statement is like people aren&amp;#39;t politics we can discuss like foreign policy we can discuss uh being eco-friendly versus not being eco-friendly we can discuss government spending role of government in people&amp;#39;s lives that&amp;#39;s political stuff people aren&amp;#39;t politics people aren&amp;#39;t politics that&amp;#39;s just not how that works people because they are born are inherent certain rights that can never ever be taken away from them and those should be defended to the death people aren&amp;#39;t politics can I afford an upgrade I can grinder level four oh it&amp;#39;s so cool now oh it&amp;#39;s maxed out that&amp;#39;s sick jumped up the wrong time I it&amp;#39;s something we&amp;#39;re good yeah yeah people are especially in in America like politics are probably the most radicalized they&amp;#39;ve been which is kind of scary yeah I think like creers at the end of the day like ESP almost because they&amp;#39;re like homegrown like have to fence it they don&amp;#39;t have to fence it but the let me that they have they choose to fence it way more than ow ow holy [ __ ] they choose to fence it way more than like other people in different positions I was dodging the whole time by the way the game is just like having issues registering that I&amp;#39;m trying to move that yeah I need to not lock on against this guy either cuz locking on means I just dodge straight into him and die my gosh dude I actually die for the first time and he was beating my ass that guy is really strong yeah there&amp;#39;s definitely in recent times like an extreme radicalization among American politics and oh I think like throw it over there like this I don&amp;#39;t think I can make it up there yeah there&amp;#39;s some things that I think this is a hard thing for a lot of people from like a okay they&amp;#39;re from over here from like a discussion like that is like like I said like there are some things we can compromise on uh people aren&amp;#39;t things we can compromise on people have inable rights that can&amp;#39;t be taken away those are things we can&amp;#39;t compromise on yeah you can still love what you love and just kind of like uh understand that there&amp;#39;s kind of some icky aspects to it as long as you&amp;#39;re like mature and willing to admit those things and confront them maturely constructively like that&amp;#39;s the difference I feel Oh They&amp;#39;ll shoot you down okay that&amp;#39;s fine right like I can still appreciate that like the FNAF games that Scott made are really really good and defined it literally defined a genre because they were so good probably one the most successful indie horror games of all time but I can still be like hey that guy sucks especially now since he&amp;#39;s retired I don&amp;#39;t have to worry about enjoying or paying for FNAF content without sporting like it&amp;#39;s just not a thing anymore you know I just don&amp;#39;t it&amp;#39;s not something I have to worry about yeah if they&amp;#39;re not getting money anymore we&amp;#39;re good Radcliff asked me in just the once OD very proud of his artifacts m I think he said and partial to tooa Japan doesn&amp;#39;t seem the samura perhaps that&amp;#39;sa to gawa prounce it you goer going to appropriate a bunch of Japanese architecture into your game can you Le pronounce things right I guess that&amp;#39;s that that is the point it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s being conscious about how she doesn&amp;#39;t know how to but like it&amp;#39;s just my joke that&amp;#39;s my two cents in the project I was seeing looked really really cool yeah I think that&amp;#39;s like it&amp;#39;s one of those things that like it&amp;#39;s really complex to understand Zan because like a lot of people don&amp;#39;t get CU it&amp;#39;s a very non American thing like a lot of like the like anti-semitic references in Harry Potter that are historically very like traditionally European in terms of its discrimination is not something that like Americans get so it&amp;#39;s like even harder for them to understand like how certain things are like you know the configuration&amp;#39;s point of origin was obvious first the library Court fire and it spread disastrously when the gas line exploded he still sitting there yeah where is like you know me who got my degree in post studies um and all that like you know I&amp;#39;m aware of it but like most Americans don&amp;#39;t understand like the historical uh caricatures and uh in bad faith betrayals of Jewish people so they don&amp;#39;t they don&amp;#39;t see that when they see it meita they don&amp;#39;t recognize it trying to saved my life I survived because she showed me how to escape I didn&amp;#39;t leave the lamp in the library and din didn&amp;#39;t knock yeah that&amp;#39;s another step Phantom is a lot of them would just probably be like the map thing a lot of them would probably still see him be like you know a lot of them would still probably not care even if they did fully understand it unfortunate ignorance is one thing but a lot of people choose to also not adjust after they know as well and that&amp;#39;s disappointing if you don&amp;#39;t know you don&amp;#39;t know right like we were discussing that on Tuesday cuz somebody dropped a good old r word in the middle of one of their videos reacting to um lot people even at Jo before still don&amp;#39;t know the full context of why that is harmful and how it affects people like even in 2024 but it&amp;#39;s different if they know when they&amp;#39;re using it anyways they just decide that they don&amp;#39;t care you know a whole different story in that regard okay they just kind of go at you until you&amp;#39;re done problem is like the the horse thing is so slow but like it&amp;#39;s the only thing that breaks through their guard I kind of need to use it this is terrible oh great caterpillar why have you abandoned us the daughters so peculiar too because like Harry Potter is such an inclusive like IP a dubious honor I suspect we&amp;#39;re doing music things no not I Wasing something important like there&amp;#39;s literally an entire plotline about like uh like mixed blood with her Min and describing how that discrimination is really harmful and bad with her but they&amp;#39;re like but then you know the Creator is very discriminatory herself it doesn&amp;#39;t really make sense doesn&amp;#39;t really match the messages of what the even the series itself is trying to [Music] send this is not music this is what I&amp;#39;m saying about the the bootleg Legend is all like this is the Ocarina stuff oh you&amp;#39;ve lost Rhythm oh sorry my bad a little [Music] early the tunes embedded in my memory like Twinkle Twinkle Little Bat look at those horses oh my gosh H to the tree are they good the games are Classics very very good games very very solid and wonderful experiences especially like the new ones that are more open like breath of wild and tear of the Kingdom breath of wild is one of my favorite recent like video game experiences I was listen to that soundtrack the other day when we were doing our house slipper uh stream it&amp;#39;s fun yeah I think it&amp;#39;s a good way to phrase this like she put that Arc into this into the plot that didn&amp;#39;t fully understand and the concept he I think it sucks especially with the rling thing because like she has uh had so many chances to understand the things she says and do are incorrect and harmful but she just always seems to choose to double down instead which is always very disheartening oh [ __ ] oh my God oh my God all these take care first all right he just does that any more of these yes going to take care of these things so I can fight him one V one I feel like there&amp;#39;s still one more out here if I&amp;#39;m still seeing those guys yeah I can hear it too yeah is if they blend in is the problem I was busy finding something else I love this thing so much especially now that it&amp;#39;s fully leveled up actually better to fight these things at range it feels like cuz that Spin Attack when he gets mad like it&amp;#39;s almost impossible to DOD so it&amp;#39;s better to find him like all the way out here but you can&amp;#39;t do that yeah I feel like it&amp;#39;s one of those things you know it&amp;#39;s like if you actually pay attention to like the uh like the rhetoric and lessons of the the movies books like the characters that are the protagonists would never ever stand for what their auth the author that made them is doing and to some extent you can still enjoy it for that reason right because I Harry wouldn&amp;#39;t be down for any of this that&amp;#39;s for damn sure might be the shrines from Dark Souls 2il there is another one I&amp;#39;m going upgrade the horse lot on next cuz as slow as it is it is like really satisfying to just whack somebody like full force with that thing oh my gosh Rec so fast I L hit that on purpose I could slow down a bit SL that&amp;#39;s fun sorry I had to lock in there yeah exactly what Matt said I feel like I remember them saying that like specifically because of that they would not come back in hindsight cuz they were kids when they started that and okay I I don&amp;#39;t know why it happens sometimes it&amp;#39;s like Smash Brothers sometimes when you leap off of that thing it eats your jumps like you only get one afterwards very odd I don&amp;#39;t know what exactly what causes that this looks like a boss oh why there&amp;#39;s active enemies in front of me and Al chose to look at the [ __ ] floor realiz it&amp;#39;s kind of funny we went from playing uh we ended up playing uh uh Detroit becomes human or one of the major Side characters was named Alice and obsession with Alice and Wonderland and now we&amp;#39;re playing an Alice and Wonderland game just do that on purpose the floor is your real enemy I mean in dbd it is the oh okay I see probably don&amp;#39;t have time anymore okay give minute full circle yep wait I have to go get that again just to make it all the way up there freaking oh that&amp;#39;s been my main word lately intriguing this game system foring on leges is very very uh always people that say like oh well it&amp;#39;s an old game so that&amp;#39;s why but like s Cooper in like 2000 was like making better Improvement system so like it&amp;#39;s all relative right I knew that [ __ ] was going to [ __ ] happen I knew it I knew it was going to do that thing where like I was technically above the platform but it was like hey well you&amp;#39;re not allowed up there dude that [ __ ] was happening I&amp;#39;m going to scream the system sucks it makes me sad yeah syy Cooper is amazing like Cooper is one of those games that like started off really really strong and only got better and better and better and better like there was decent time but we don&amp;#39;t talk about that one gosh I love everybody I didn&amp;#39;t mean do that yeah I just say then there&amp;#39;s number four we don&amp;#39;t talk about number four I believe so I believe yeah I can that with Dore I feel like okay so this is going to be an e thing so those you guys who remember pyer one remember the um like the like the voodoo like boss in levels I feel like that giant snake level where you spend that entire level running from that giant snake was the beginning of my aop phobia the music in that level is like super [ __ ] ominous and then they got the giant snake chasing you down like the end like absolutely terrifying open up hey ah they are they are wide Knock knock hello yeah you going to do something about I&amp;#39;m just going to pretend I&amp;#39;m not after you there you go I don&amp;#39;t know why that took so long was weird what you personally find rewarding and fun um making people happy that&amp;#39;s a really like basic answer like providing Comfort content for people a lot of people tell me to like go to sleep to my content or like use it on their breaks at work or how it got them through a hard time or something uh by extension the amount of charity work I&amp;#39;m able to do is never something I&amp;#39;ve ever had access to in my life before uh stuff like the charity tournament we just did last Saturday being able to take part in something that excellent and that helps the world so much I didn&amp;#39;t have access to that in any of the other jobs that I uh add but through streaming I&amp;#39;ve been have so many opportunities so many opportunities to raise money for good causes and um that&amp;#39;s Irreplaceable for me those are the things I enjoy the most I don&amp;#39;t like this area&amp;#39;s like obsession with like making you do the rabbit thing with these statues like the time stuff&amp;#39;s already kind of annoying and stressful as it is so making you do it twice is kind of like silly to me can I make it up from here I can I even need that good good so it&amp;#39;s not something you can do that with last one I had to for sure and that was not my favorite but it&amp;#39;s is fine da da da da you&amp;#39;re blocking that whole time H you&amp;#39;re blocking that whole time even though you&amp;#39;re flying and your sword isn&amp;#39;t in front of your face anymore you&amp;#39;re totally still blocking goo enjoy your nothing worth it often is that point that&amp;#39;s just a flex it&amp;#39;s just a point Flex that&amp;#39;s all that is look at how much time I spent here I can just Lally throw the [ __ ] away didn&amp;#39;t say something positive something positive um actually actually fulfill my an bargain sorry I&amp;#39;m very fortunate to have a group of people that are as supportive as you guys are the content creation space essentially you&amp;#39;re a public figure so you have to be kind of like just open to everything and anything which includes a lot of very negative and harsh treatment um and that is very not great for mental health but like there&amp;#39;s also very lovely supportive people like you guys that are positive for the mental health so I appreciate you guys that kind of like do your best to balance that out right enjoy Outlast deceptive have fun a bridge will complete the path but this substance has the way can help us to I believe I&amp;#39;ve got the proper tool at the top of the mountain you will find the entrance to the next sacred cave this looks like a boss Arena it is try as many of them up here as I can he&amp;#39;s fighting me back there&amp;#39;s dudes down here too I&amp;#39;m shooting the system a little bit but me I do not care wonder what okay so it&amp;#39;s like with these you defeat a certain amount of enemies and they go from like liquid to something you can actually break is it in the Next Room save you&amp;#39;re free my friends what [Music] Not Invisible one okay it&amp;#39;s not in this room hey Zeno how&amp;#39;s it going friend how are you what is this oh it&amp;#39;s all the way up here like all the way up here back up backing up backing up well that&amp;#39;s what unlocks this 52 I&amp;#39;m currently 52 y nice you grinding I was making a joke in a ghost stream the other day I was like I only talk to top 10 zenos somebody&amp;#39;s like what about Zeno them I didn&amp;#39;t stutter I was joking of course but yeah that was funny yeah not not dins you know good Pokemon I was playing poo earlier today they have a lot of like the new Scarlet Pokemon out now I got uh a level a three star pomy which is pretty cool trying to get one of those evolved Pokemon go yes I love Pogo Pogo is very fun is it as I used to I used to like travel take over gyms and like do raids and stuff but kind of just do it casually now these guys keep infinitely showing okay I was going to take care of these guys first but they just seem to infinitely show up so oh that disappeared yep that these just disappeared I need P why I just took damage while dead what a I don&amp;#39;t think that&amp;#39;s supposed to be a thing I just took damage dead interesting I guess these guys just infinitely spawn here CU they&amp;#39;re their little goopy Factory Nam bubblegum they go back through oh that their their stuff made it hey [ __ ] off I deal with yall but you&amp;#39;re infinitely respawning so there&amp;#39;s kind of no reason to bye my little hidey-ho ho course not hidey ho I just got [ __ ] Chucky flashback trust the unpleasant from your mind Alice reject the painful as you would the repulsive and deant forgetting is is therapist best advice he&amp;#39;s given in the entire game&amp;#39;s worth of ow the entire game worth of of like advice stus is just forget everything just forget okay the texture was just missing on that I was like does that mean I can&amp;#39;t go on that or like what&amp;#39;s the deal no it was just it was just broken yes I see the enemies but because they are infinitely responding I kind of not inclined to deal with them how much is the next 775 that&amp;#39;s expensive yeah but the the thing was like the platform came back up and it still did not have its sexure that was funny that sucks then I&amp;#39;m sorry to hear that sometimes I miss it sometimes I really don&amp;#39;t like even if you have like a oh okay the game crashed what is that like our fifth one today that&amp;#39;s like our fifth crash today oh man it was not this this game has such like super like positive reviews on uh skill issue that&amp;#39;s a skill issue on uh steam it&amp;#39;s a very poor port I&amp;#39;m surprised it&amp;#39;s not like reflected in the reviews I think we did a pretty good job so [Music] far was this made 2011 very very old game when of its 13th anniversary the same here it did I have that installed too I haven&amp;#39;t played it yet though usually doesn&amp;#39;t take this long to load might be not responding from the background again me see yeah it&amp;#39;s not responding again up to six six crashes yeah usually when it&amp;#39;s just loading back like it&amp;#39;s going back forth like that doesn&amp;#39;t load in immediately it&amp;#39;s just not responding in the background this point I should just keep F manager up nice wallp paper thank you I made it myself got the devious and evil logo but it&amp;#39;s uh over like a really cozy like sty background I think maybe we will love the original so much they&amp;#39;re just kind of like the reviews just kind of Overlook how terrible of a port it is and they&amp;#39;re just like well the old game was amazing oh this is amazing too our go and it&amp;#39;s like well I like the game to be playable there we go I have to redo this entire section cool I love that I think it crashed while trying to autosave after completing that section and that&amp;#39;s what caused it to up do I have to do the key thing again the keyhole thing I probably do probably didn&amp;#39;t say that either why is that oh oh why can it hit me while I&amp;#39;m already dead I do that&amp;#39;s [ __ ] up so it it hit me while I was already dead and then like proceeded to it hit me while I was already dead and then proceeded to hit me the moment I spawn by the way the reason I&amp;#39;m not dealing with these guys you can fight them just the problem the reason I&amp;#39;m not fighting them is cuz they infinitely respawn here so there&amp;#39;s like clearing there&amp;#39;s no way to clear them out they just come right back so yeah this this part&amp;#39;s very annoying certainly doesn&amp;#39;t help that I&amp;#39;m having to completely redo it but I&amp;#39;m probably going to have to redo that key thing again cuz it didn&amp;#39;t save the he I picked up so probably didn&amp;#39;t save that either video game moment yeah yeah I didn&amp;#39;t save it good thing I checked flush the unpleasant from your mind Alice reject the painful as you would the repulsive and depraved forgetting and heart I make it back onto here without having to no I&amp;#39;m just going to get [ __ ] slammed by like 13 dudes all right back up here again get my horse back out thank you why are they all up here am I getting I&amp;#39;m getting hit in the cut scene that I can&amp;#39;t move in Escape guys get away for the M as possible I can&amp;#39;t get rid of them that took way longer than it should have by the way there&amp;#39;s a giant evil train trying to destroy Wonderland that&amp;#39;s why we&amp;#39;re doing all this if if you forgotten it&amp;#39; be easy to forget considering how off topic We Are The Grateful most often confer benefit to the source of their gratitude that he didn&amp;#39;t even say anything there he said the Grateful are grateful to the person that made them grateful like that&amp;#39;s literally what he just said he made it try he dressed it up to make it sound kind of cool but like lit all he said was like if people are grateful to a person they express their gratitude yes what yeah and grass is green buddy thank you thank you for the update I can&amp;#39;t hit that from over here that&amp;#39;s funny [Music] [Music] hey picklocks that&amp;#39;s SC some people die when they are killed energy literally that&amp;#39;s like literally exactly like people die when they are killed it&amp;#39;s like uh yeah what is your point good to see you friend b a bit hopefully you been well am I supposed to make it from all the way over here I don&amp;#39;t think I cheated the system oh there was a platform there thought I thought it just allowed me to jump again they&amp;#39;re just very hard to see here is incredibly hard to see at this against this backdrop I thought it just allowed me to like double them like 14 times I was like wa that&amp;#39;s amazing my glitchless [Music] run when Papa grounded me I climbed down the trellis the tree branch makes a bridge yeah crossplay does so much for gaming in general cuz suddenly just we&amp;#39;re not sisters you get people just getting the game just cuz I go with dragon balls that&amp;#39;s it they don&amp;#39;t even think about it right just like o DBZ regardless of the game&amp;#39;s [Music] quality or like you know their parents or their grandparents will get it for him just because they&amp;#39;re like why don&amp;#39;t you like Dragon Ball this is a dragon ball game right it&amp;#39;s a funny story about that uh I&amp;#39;ve I&amp;#39;ve historically until I was like in college got every single Dragon Ball Z game that ever released um as it came out massive Dragon Ball nerd um and everybody in my family knew it so my childhood best friend got me Dragon Ball zai 2 but so did my grandma and so did my parents so I ended up with a three whopping copies of Dragon Ball zai 2 cuz everybody thought they were like oh I likes Dragon Ball I&amp;#39;ll get this for for his birthday but they all did it at the same time so I ended up with three copies of the game it&amp;#39;s very very funny that game was hard as [ __ ] cuz the story mode was like not like a fun story mode it was like some weird like chess game on top of like being really really difficult it was not that entertaining it was not that fun guy three though just KZ reg the for I to is kind of messy though like the second time like she&amp;#39;s look straight up while he&amp;#39;s talking and just like nothing&amp;#39;s appeared see I still haven&amp;#39;t played kakon it makes me sad I&amp;#39;ve heard such good things about it this is fun use the force let&amp;#39;s go Luke I still really adore that the shells have never changed despite not being in the ocean Area fire Ellis save yourself wake up Lizzy Lizzy open the door the key Lizzy unlock the door you&amp;#39;ll burn not paying attention there&amp;#39;s no time to waste there&amp;#39;s no time at all and you were ugly oh on these guys oh yeah this is where this is helpful oh yeah why does she Dodge into the enemy sometimes that&amp;#39;s so weird Dodge system leaves a lot to be desired in a lot of ways cuz she just kind of just halfhazard does it and doesn&amp;#39;t give much thought to like how she&amp;#39;s dodging and that could be the difference between you living or dying success oh I just have to survive come let&amp;#39;s don&amp;#39;t dou you&amp;#39;ve already missed the train oh I I I would I would prefer actually you know y I got an extra health I prefer to handle the main problem it&amp;#39;s just a linear game so I&amp;#39;m doing little side quest I&amp;#39;m not allowed to avoid not my fault man oh you&amp;#39;re not allowed back in there okay understood know that&amp;#39;s on purpose yeah shame me for not uh not going after the main uh Quest when you were padding out the main game by not allowing me to do the main quest I ask you daily ding well I don&amp;#39;t have agency in this game okay that hit him and me little [ __ ] it I&amp;#39;m not going to be SC on on the teeth cuz I&amp;#39;m want that maximum bone behave I didn&amp;#39;t mean it like that okay relax trying to get out of the way all [Music] right sorry dog wisdom my bad B I got to wait wait my turn oh there&amp;#39;s fire that&amp;#39;s not good I jumped early cuz I was afraid the fire was going to [ __ ] blast me when I got up there but oh mysterious West what would that be just like a bunch of McDonald&amp;#39;s on every corner in gas stations and some racist guy yelling on the corner would that be the mysterious West getting down with the man I&amp;#39;m trying another 2D level oh boy the belligerant without true cause or purpose abused and murdered their pacif why this area has been so long they hated for being different corrupted the Vivid world the assaulted could not comprehend brutality we almost spent the entire like on trying toate their oppressors entire play so far in one zone the cruel Interlopers attacked at intervals instead of killing them all at once The Wretched survivors suffered and ual Fe is there a worse F wday night zero where you weeds out there proud of [Music] me how was I supposed to avoid something that was quite literally at the time off screen what you know about the Fate series I watched it I watched all of Fate Zero I hate these Fireballs so [ __ ] much so [ __ ] much because like it&amp;#39;s not enough to jump them you have to clear them by like a mile or else they count it&amp;#39;s very very obnoxious okay her jump in this 2D zone is very like bad very sluggish OB I watched all Fate Zero I don&amp;#39;t know if I finished day night I know I was watching it at one point I [ __ ] hate these Fireballs more than I hate myself like holy [ __ ] they have the most forgiving hit box in the history of gaming like they will hit you from like a [ __ ] year away and be like oh that&amp;#39;s fine it&amp;#39;s not enough to avoid them you have to avoid them by at least a double jumps worth of space or else they [ __ ] hit you holy [ __ ] it&amp;#39;s probably because they&amp;#39;re the same ones that like these are the same projectiles that were supposed to be there for like the boat situation like the boat Sid scroller but now Alice is here and it&amp;#39;s just kind of like mixing badly oh my gosh I just smashed my head through yeah I watched all of Fate Zero supposed to be isn&amp;#39;t that supposed to be the prequel to the uh the rest of the series yeah yeah so we watched that first and we were in the middle of watching the other one I don&amp;#39;t know if we ever finished it they word for most tedious video game goes to like look I clearly jumped the [ __ ] over that and it [ __ ] hit me anyway like I&amp;#39;m so [ __ ] done this game sucks ass [Music] oh I just literally teleport this is the worst [ __ ] [ __ ] I hate this so much it&amp;#39;s so [ __ ] tedious and annoying I&amp;#39;m surprised that top Fireball didn&amp;#39;t hit me knowing this gamees and how it treats the fireball projectiles like hun Hatchet they literally are it&amp;#39;s so obnoxious hun hun hatchets under lack specifically may be on walls and [ __ ] hey look I&amp;#39;m Chris Redfield supposed to fall I was supposed to avoid the projectile I couldn&amp;#39;t see understood my bad at a certain point I feel like this game is trolling [Music] me there we go I just should have prec cognitively known exactly where to go and not die four times to things I literally couldn&amp;#39;t [ __ ] [Music] see dying sorry not in game not this time in real life [Music] he from the Mario serers you guys seen that it&amp;#39;s like the newest thing with uh Whatchamacallit with like the Mario like Community is that there&amp;#39;s evil Peach now like wow it&amp;#39;s so cool I oh say I don&amp;#39;t think I was supposed to be able to land on [Music] that you know when the the little thing disappears behind there I can barely [ __ ] see it so the fact that I need to avoid that or else it kills me is uh interesting [Music] you got my little toe got I got an air in my little pinky toe or you put in my knee that way I can never be an adventurer again just that joke hey this game&amp;#39;s from 2011 I need to to this game is an exercising patience I have played more annoying games that are like actually aggravating frustrating but I&amp;#39;ve never played a game that&amp;#39;s so casually just a pain in the ass like nothing about this flows or feels good everything about it is very like clunky and awkward like it is a very awkward game that just kind to it feels it&amp;#39;s got that like Behavior traa the fact that it feels like it&amp;#39;s held together by like spit and duct tape oh I just jumped over there back welcome back astral [Music] we it will still never bother me that that loading screen the loading text is offc Center for like literally no reason hello once again Alice dodging into the enemy not away from them for some reason oh well was even fighting you where did you come from I just continues to take the Fireballs in face like clearly this is not working out and he continues to like throw them at you she&amp;#39;s happy I&amp;#39;m even a big TF person but I got that more my brother then we&amp;#39;ll buy a pack of sticky gum Incorporated oh be Behavior interactive we come from our [ __ ] upgrade for our Hammer is like 700 it&amp;#39;s a lot oh boy another time to Pat out the game a little bit more with another slide puzzer Adventure second one this section the shadow dragon winds along the path drag nots on your got him ah I see how it goes makes perfect sense really at least now what happened to the killer train is it an immediate danger how do we have all this time to just like [ __ ] around oh ho with the bomb see the the danger is as immediately present as it seems to be thanks considered how many of these are there a lot was the answer thankfully it&amp;#39;s over I wish the Roses did something if you were already at fall and you collected them and maybe extra teeth or something that&amp;#39;d be cool that your perfect game what would it be um I&amp;#39;ll be some extra fulfilling and super awesome RPG to be honest or like a uh like an RPG or like a survival horror game probably something like that would probably be like a game I would make I like how if you weren&amp;#39;t in the small mode you wouldn&amp;#39;t even see them there that&amp;#39;s the funny part a little Story game that&amp;#39;d be cool I think in theory like I like games but I never want to design one I feel like getting those games just right is like kind of like a nightmare extremely difficult and I would not want to like designing like writing like the lore and designing the characters would be fun but like actually balancing them and getting that perfect mix of like [ __ ] and unfair versus like actually rewardingly hard is like that seems extremely difficult I would not trust myself to pull it off correctly he still more yeah there&amp;#39;s still more because yeah we didn&amp;#39;t teleport back to the puzzle should go tiny you can use uh the crow uh control of control to shrink that well helps you solve uh puzzles and stuff this one yeah just random yeah I be just oh there&amp;#39;s a mechanic you just randomly turn small I do think uh this is my favorite dress that she has had so far she pretty neat okay a long road to that 700 something that we need to upgrade this horce for the last time actually don&amp;#39;t even know I don&amp;#39;t remember what that is on the top of my hand I mean whatever you&amp;#39;re into I guess like that does it for you that does it for you but all yours I guess I really my thing I about say if there&amp;#39;s more I&amp;#39;m like this a lot all right um I&amp;#39;ll try to be quick as possible I have had to use rushan for quite some time I was looking for like a a uh like a more seamless place to like pause but seems like the the puzzle is going to be the quickest thing I&amp;#39;ll get I&amp;#39;ll be right back is oh we&amp;#39;re back yeah I would usually put up words but like this game doesn&amp;#39;t like being all tab so like just like I&amp;#39;ll just be quick also good as you hopefully it will I didn&amp;#39;t want to do that one oops that not working out though the gate is opened now it appears that I can continue my Ascent to the peak um hello okay well these are cages that are holding their friends so sad uh yeah Wesker for all intents and purpos is no longer human zombie I don&amp;#39;t think it would be the Zombie I don&amp;#39;t think is the right word but he is definitely an experiment he is not like human I switch to the imagination uhoh take things it&amp;#39;s not enough that they abuse and murder us they let their SP feed on our corses that&amp;#39;s rough buddy no trauma up being in stream why is that so funny just like a phenomena that happens while streaming usually sitting there playing your favorite game just vibing somebody&amp;#39;s like I have bad news something extremely [ __ ] traumatizing oh um I&amp;#39;m sorry this is like one of those things just like in context it&amp;#39;s like oh interesting I think people just generally derive like a lot of like comfort from their streamers so they just kind of like think that they can just like push that boundary in a public setting I guess would be like the rationale but I always find that phenomena very interesting oh I need to get out of here I&amp;#39;m going to die because of the camera being stuck on the staircase yeah uhoh you there come close I can recite Red Riding H backward I know my multiplication table 21s I I have intelligence really persuade me to remove the obstruction W the Frog and empty his belly wake that what about its tongue and the prospect of warts anyway from froms imag it was done while I was remember not want these things I need to AC get rid of that not oh I see cuz these guys have wings they can follow me anywhere interesting oh okay that makes sense what is happening what is dude [ __ ] the camera is having a problem he the the not playing nice with this whole like multiple levels of battle thing oh that the I&amp;#39;m not hitting you sound I believe that&amp;#39;s kind of terrifying Hi how are you this is fine toally fine I I can&amp;#39;t see a thing right side I can&amp;#39;t see oh okay it finally got me that&amp;#39;s do pleasure is for a lot of people Chelsea it&amp;#39;s like it&amp;#39;s a I called it a cold classic in the advertisement for a reason a lot of people&amp;#39;s like favorite game growing up okay how else do I hit you you have one more little guy ow how did that hit me brother what get out of this okay oh that&amp;#39;s by camera the game I getting hit more by the camera being woning than I ever have like an actual enemy come good he&amp;#39;s like I don&amp;#39;t know what to do here got him there&amp;#39;s one dude that just never come out of this came out of his hiy spot over there it&amp;#39;s kind of funny okay I see perhaps if I rang that gong he&amp;#39;ll wake up I&amp;#39;m wait for you is it right is it wrong how I get up there oh I&amp;#39;m in thank you y I wanted that heart that was up here no long who well that doesn&amp;#39;t seem helpy to am your digestive system but you know you I guess what the point of all that why did I do that how&amp;#39;s this helping me beat the the the demon train that is fully destroying Wonderland how&amp;#39;s this tied together de with friends that&amp;#39;s fun miss we&amp;#39;re still on this this level the mysterious East a 3our long section very interesting to say the least 609 close enough close enough thought I heard another one I guess not miss these nuts call them I&amp;#39;ve been good I haven&amp;#39;t been on about those jokes in quite a while that&amp;#39;s a Papa John&amp;#39;s what happened the Savage regard the endurance of pain as the measure of wor ah yeah Pain Olympics bad understood sometimes I&amp;#39;m like five service games are a plague and other times I&amp;#39;m like sometimes games just be wonky and [ __ ] broken and then they used to be stuck that way forever that it was loud what was that noise almost sounds like a snake rattle which is kind of unnerving me a little that&amp;#39;s a b you know I shoot the guy first I don&amp;#39;t like that snake rattle noise by everybody no I&amp;#39;m just going to [ __ ] for the 19 millionth time just like barely make it up to a platform and just be denied going up the platform because he of course oh Cool&amp;#39;s a clunky mess dude hi everybody I&amp;#39;m sure that&amp;#39;s what you&amp;#39;re supposed to do you&amp;#39;re just supposed to be able to just leave I&amp;#39;m sure they appreciate that I got memories to get back your BOS Rush okay that&amp;#39;s regrettably the creature has to die for its image to be properly captured the subjects of art often suffer just want cats do hey Ross how&amp;#39;s it going dude he was still cracking me up earlier was like what what did he say he was like if people are grateful to someone they show their gratitude like yeah I like the uh the analogy you guys here that gives uh people people die when they were killed energy that did more damage to me than most things in the game did that&amp;#39;s interesting he was hinting I think he was just rambling just old man yelling at Sky hey G canina how fck y&amp;#39;all [ __ ] these forehead but I do help them and they&amp;#39;re not helping me out at all they don&amp;#39;t they&amp;#39;re not they&amp;#39;re just kind of hard existing yeah but like they&amp;#39;re not helping me they&amp;#39;re just kind of hard existing so return to the point Chester shy just or Chester cat is just talking out his ass this guy just die already not taking a hint I&amp;#39;ll wait for it to go completely down so I can get maximum damage there we go we take the hit they don&amp;#39;t he&amp;#39;s just doing his little pouette over there he does he does his little pette and it doesn&amp;#39;t even like land near him kind of funny High maybe I have to go find him okay there we go easy peasy yeah just the plot armor just in context dude I&amp;#39;m doing my best just pulls out umbrella and only just like I can&amp;#39;t do anything anymore umbrella huh that&amp;#39;s all that defeats you brought missing Point earlier like we&amp;#39;re supposed to be like you know going through just you know stop this killer train from you know destroying out uh Wonderland but like we have killed and destroyed more things here than that train ever has so like&amp;#39;s the reality un certainty and unhappiness in her own life could not endure to see them suffering she began to fight against the Savage murderers abusers and defilers without quite knowing why or for whose sake she truly fought or how the struggle would end kill the villain that makes you a hero it&amp;#39;s Justified murder villains from cr&amp;#39;s point of view that&amp;#39;s the question okay I just missed that [Music] now no I&amp;#39;m a [Music] boss this level has been going on for three plus hours a very f [Music] I&amp;#39;ll never take you for granted again myself I don&amp;#39;t why her jump is so clunky in the 2D world but it is not as responsive as the 3D effort oh hey [ __ ] how&amp;#39;s it going friend how are you Beach I&amp;#39;m Princess Peach I&amp;#39;m so thrilled oh my gosh hor welcome to the stream oh my gosh I&amp;#39;m so happy to see you how is your day I hope you are smiling right now because I&amp;#39;m smiling cuz I&amp;#39;m so [ __ ] happy to see you how are you bestie was that better cuz it was fake I can leave immediate Karma what happened is I got stuck under this somehow while she was going for the animation to open it so now she yeah [ __ ] open it well the good thing is I can just go to the menu and come back in the game didn&amp;#39;t crash this [Music] time R the whole thing for why a Restless Seeker on private business arrived in the misery infested land she despite ignorance and I am theery in her own life could not Eno to see them suffering she began to fight against the Savage murderers abusers and defilers without quite knowing why or for who seek she truly fought yeah I I love how it&amp;#39;s like not only people that have previously been here are regulars but people coming in just specifically to watch the game we like yo this is the best game of all time I love this game so much and I can&amp;#39;t go [ __ ] 20 minutes without a [ __ ] crash or gamebreaking bug it&amp;#39;s the PC Port I understand but I just think it&amp;#39;s funny just like the duct is position of like emotional responses to what is happening you know they&amp;#39;re interesting to have side by [Music] [Music] side and the funny thing is a lot of like even the like the game breaking bugs are probably like py related itude just outside of the crashes just cuz like something&amp;#39;s just not clicking with the the game on the PC version it&amp;#39;s like huh I don&amp;#39;t know how to do that in this [Music] mode what&amp;#39;s really going to happen is I&amp;#39;m going to be like oh yeah the game was fine it&amp;#39;s just uh you know it&amp;#39;s just PC issues and I&amp;#39;m going to play the original version someday and it&amp;#39;s going to be Justice Bucky and be like you li to me this why did you do this to me oh I was coming sorry for breaking your game okay rest SW wh oh that was enough to hit me play it for uh looking at chat while trying to do a platform you second might would be so much happier if like if Alice was above something more than slightly that she would still make the platform that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s where I that&amp;#39;s if that was not in this game I I would I would love this game like 9 10 out of 10 the fact that like Alice for some reason if she&amp;#39;s above a platform but it&amp;#39;s not by at least a foot she just decides I can&amp;#39;t make that it&amp;#39;s probably the biggest um problem with progress that I&amp;#39;ve had in this game thus far he that&amp;#39;s good to see that&amp;#39;s funny that&amp;#39;s some Sonic ass [ __ ] with the [ __ ] uh Springs [Music] FL so right that&amp;#39;s why I don&amp;#39;t put a massive amount of effort into like big long over edited videos anymore because the algorithm despite the quality of the game can just say yeah that sucks even though it doesn&amp;#39;t and I&amp;#39;m just like oh cool I spent so much effort on that thanks I even crouched you like how the platform is patient up to wait and be like oh wow damn you got you got [ __ ] on there and then it kept going I hate this game so much [Music] I literally carried me for like half a second and then just dropped me like why is this happening I don&amp;#39;t understand it was just like I I I just I just just don&amp;#39;t feel like it right now was having a bad mental health day and just the [ __ ] the Little Gus thing I was supposed to car me was having a bad mental all day was like you know I should have taken to day off but I came to work anyway got to pay those bills you know sorry that your order was [Music] shitty oh you can land on that cool yeah you&amp;#39;ve been you&amp;#39;ve been killing it lately Kaiser your re has been hitting that algorithm like nobody&amp;#39;s business should be proud of that like a [ __ ] 4our section oh my gosh one of those is going to hit me skill issue almost mushed me [Music] it&amp;#39;s really good I&amp;#39;m happy for you I couldn&amp;#39;t jump it and avoid the bomb at or the fireball at the same time can you stop smooshing me please be very polite if you uh just didn&amp;#39;t fire k a lot so jumping is not the answer just running to one side of the platform and barely avoiding it is the answer long I&amp;#39;m getting my value though I pay for this game well I&amp;#39;m getting my money&amp;#39;s worth I having going to beong so let me jog my Amy Lee looking ass through this game beat it turn it in we will persevere we will save Wonderland and uh ride the Chuchu train got it&amp;#39;s the caterpillar that&amp;#39;s not a cat nor is it a pillar fire I&amp;#39;ve come all this way to find a similar If I Had the Time i&amp;#39; detail how often you prefer dealing with Illusions rather than the real thing problems you refuse to deal with don&amp;#39;t exist you deny reality okay I didn&amp;#39;t ask for [ __ ] therapy real no and you allow others to tell you what isn&amp;#39;t real now come inside this isn&amp;#39;t Charlotte&amp;#39;s Web it&amp;#39;s Al Wonderland what the hell is this got you Beed so you can wake me up so that&amp;#39;s why I said am that&amp;#39;s

Shrek somebody Me growing corruption or assist my search what does she know that I don&amp;#39;t she is someone you once knew and loved just some that I used to know not all change is good some remember that when you find used to know you really are a shk looking ass time changes as wow that was a three and a half hour level that was a lot a long long long long long level holy moly away what you there enough that in jail ni this time Fred howling outside the old lady muttering about a murder in thread needle Street cursing insects on the National Rail Road had to bring her end I men to herself but now D you do have surely she don&amp;#39;t belong in child too true but where then does she belong let&amp;#39;s walk her out F send her back to Dr Bambi he raised o l last time I kept her

walking Jack to the cells he&amp;#39;s M than the usual never wrong bloke nonsense when he sees Alice that&amp;#39;s a [ __ ] what D it he she screams you miserable C you L you maggot living off another&amp;#39;s labor etc etc I&amp;#39;m admiring her line of inquiry but suddenly she hits her head or something and Fates couldn&amp;#39;t send her own could I I imagine speaking fit said

fighting abusive language he said filing sign if you can [Music] K can ah flashbang sorry all right rest all Kaiser appreciate you thank you for hanging what the heck the heck is happening [Music] I&amp;#39;m I&amp;#39;m mildly [Music] Disturbed this level pissed me off is this the one Alice is was worrying about like you thought you hited the water level it&amp;#39;s a water level in video game okay it&amp;#39;s part of the course I love the jump cuts to like the cut scene freaking out my car [Music] I can change that quick yeah this game doesn&amp;#39;t play well with being uh being uh alt tabed which is why there not been a lot in the way of a [ __ ] lot of like redemptions and stuff [Music] wait that&amp;#39;s not you hello I just want the real you I adding a different you why no there an admin oh well okay well you just go to TTV just go to better TTV and log in with your Twitch and then them yeah I didn&amp;#39;t I should have just added you two as uh admins what a card huh [Music] sorry wait where am I now I still want the thing what was that was that here yeah that&amp;#39;s [Music] here hey [Music] claimed i&amp;#39; stolen his heart trifling with his affections creepy sort touching me told Papa to never invite him to tea again it&amp;#39;s un comfortable your favorite level I like everybody else is like oh my gosh [ __ ] this Level D he&amp;#39;s like he my [Music] favorite oh w [Music] did the C you mean this last one I I didn&amp;#39;t hate it as much as I it wasn&amp;#39;t bad it was just long the water was actually really long and really repetitive kind of got under under my skin a little fact they recycled the same boss like six times I was like dude we get it [ __ ] [Music] understand um okay that that was a very weird transl going to bed [Music] Bagel all I&amp;#39;ll be restful friend but it&amp;#39;s because of the crew was L accurate yeah L accurate these nuts I feel about [Music] that we&amp;#39;ve almost made it to the to be able to afford oh we did it yeah light light is useless if what it illuminates causes pain and suffering better to cast such things into the dark depths of leth the river of forgetfulness and if I if I pay for therapy my therapist just like BR just forget everything I&amp;#39;d be pissed [Music] [Music] [Music] explore around a little bit first oh I can only do so much please leave I try [Music] there just like okay so your parents are nice to you yeah and your life hasn&amp;#39;t been that traumatic yeah what the [ __ ] happened uh question [Music] [Music] so there&amp;#39;s nothing [Music] here oh there is it&amp;#39;s just up there for some reason oh and that activates that well how do we do that and open the door at the same [Music] time oh you wanted that that makes sense that TRS [Music] [Music] okay but going here has this help me [Music] it&amp;#39;s a Race Against Time but like here&amp;#39;s the but the problem is problem is you know is like to you even get the okay to even get that other platform moving I have to like use a a bomb thing so I already have one bomb taken so I can&amp;#39;t like double bomb unless this is actually going on in its own and it just takes [Music] forever we&amp;#39;ll sit here and wait yeah cuz this is the problem is like this is how I got up here and the reason I got up here is by using that one right there is how I&amp;#39;m able to even get up here in the first place so it&amp;#39;s not just a Race Against Time because to get this plat for you moving I need to hit that one and have this one pressed down but I can&amp;#39;t also have that pressed down and this press down at the same [ __ ] time I don&amp;#39;t know how I&amp;#39;m supposed to do that oh um okay plat I guess I don&amp;#39;t know well the thing is like this like I like I don&amp;#39;t know how I don&amp;#39;t know how to do what you&amp;#39;re suggesting cuz like what do you mean do that jump on this but then I how do I get back over there yeah that&amp;#39;s not like yeah it&amp;#39;s not it does not give me time to go to yeah it&amp;#39;s not yeah I think you&amp;#39;re missing the the part here that like the platform the platform needs to have that button press to lower so yeah we&amp;#39;re going to have to like maybe do this in reverse order and prey yeah just do it the other way around it&amp;#39;s like this plat we have to activate the platform yeah that no that&amp;#39;s yeah that that doesn&amp;#39;t work yeah cuz do that that still goes so like we still don&amp;#39;t have enough time [Music] [Music] this whole game&amp;#39;s been annoying to be honest big old exercise of patience put you here [Music] this even the hard part I&amp;#39;m guessing this this is supposed to be the fun [Music] part I&amp;#39;m guessing the obnoxious part L come later [Music] I literally am not fast enough to do that L I&amp;#39;m not fast enough but you know it&amp;#39;s been a skill issue before so I&amp;#39;m assuming it&amp;#39;s just a skill issue again if you were just a pro might return speedrunner you&amp;#39;d be able to make that jump every [Music] time cuz I just need the platform low enough to where I can jump onto it that that doesn&amp;#39;t need to stay up so to speak that makes sense this is the only one that needs to stay [Music] down I remember to do this one am I just way [ __ ] off cuzz this this does not seem like the right [Music] way that that&amp;#39;s turbo [ __ ] complicated for like no [ __ ] reason holy [ __ ] I do not like that the platform just goes straight up yeah the platform just goes straight back [Music] up wait so why are we button yeah but like okay I the bomb that at a specific time to actually make this holy [ __ ] that&amp;#39;s very annoying that was not fun that&amp;#39;s only the beginning of the level here we go oh hey hold on oh [Music] final level horse oo it&amp;#39;s a unicorn yeah nice steel [Music] boy oh you will play a Souls game you will make it happen soon as I&amp;#39;m done with the Zeno guide we&amp;#39;re playing games together all the [ __ ] time all the time what do you think I&amp;#39;m doing with all that free time I know where I was supposed to go after that jump it looked like straight ahead but it was just kind of [Music] [Music] like yeah we that we haven&amp;#39;t got any of like the well the maps the super super important item but like we haven&amp;#39;t got any of like [Music] the the super duper like plot progressing items yet which we can use the map to get those but why do the cars just [ __ ] disappear [Music] hello I hate levels like this in games where it&amp;#39;s just like there is a level it&amp;#39;s just like oh hey it&amp;#39;s just an abstract concept it&amp;#39;s Lally just bunch of platforms [Music] [Music] we where am I supposed toing Just Launch me the direct opposite direction of where I need to go like okay thanks game was very fun having such a good time smiling feeling joyous Jolly even I&amp;#39;ve never known a Greater Joy than playing Alice madness Returns on the PC [Music] okay where am I going oh I&amp;#39;m okay never all sorry I just jumped into a cut scene o this CH is nice I can&amp;#39;t break these oh what the [ __ ] what is are we at the end of [ __ ] Dark Souls 3 what what why where why are we here what is this the the place before was so bright and shiny and this is like the the the kilm from Dark Souls like what what is what is happening gosh bumper cars so uh how about that killer train that we&amp;#39;re trying to stop how&amp;#39;s that doing that something that is relevant still right maybe hopefully that was kind of like the whole point why we doing this would hit just right right now worms I bought Trail Mi for myself oh thank you brand from the past I love you wait for that oh I just supposed to okay I was supposed to there even though I couldn&amp;#39;t literally see the platform because of the fog oh oh and you got to do it all over again oh thank you awesome was Grand a few hours ago yeah that&amp;#39;s a good guy what Happ him I thought he&amp;#39;s pretty cool people just go downhill sometimes I guess ow I don&amp;#39;t like this well I didn&amp;#39;t even touch that one got really bit her listen listen Alice madness Returns is a is a cult classic it is a Flawless experience with no problems and uh it&amp;#39;s just everything that you ever dislike about any game is just a skill issue that&amp;#39;s what I&amp;#39;ve learned playing satly Let&amp;#39;s Plays just liking anything is a skill issue not having a good time skill issue your mother skill issue this dress is really good this is probably my favorite one we are literally a lord Ron what is what is happening back to admire your handiwork returning to the scene of the crime oh did we blow it up it had to be done cat you said so yourself you and this red queen cannot both survive she is a cancer in your body exercise her I like exercise well she was the face of evil in the Heart of Darkness oh [ __ ] it&amp;#39;s a Kingdom Hearts game didn&amp;#39;t treat you too well last time lost your head as I recall she was completely deranged you picked up her crown but now you&amp;#39;ve put it down you must speak to her what&amp;#39;s left of her anyway if she&amp;#39;s the darkness am I her nobody that how that works is see the rock this to my Sora yeah why does the wind just not take me sometimes does it do that in the original game like the wind just sometimes like I&amp;#39;ll go straight through it it just like does not pick me up like a lot of the other things are be like well it you could have like had a higher junk jump Arc or something but sometimes I just straight up going into the wind and it just goes N I don&amp;#39;t feel like it I&amp;#39;ve never been able to decipher why that particularly happens it&amp;#39;s always funny though super complex Lord that no one understands mom and dad and Vicky always giving him demands sorry wrong thing is it supposed to be possible I have two Basin to dbd no that&amp;#39;s a bug specific on Larry&amp;#39;s right now Larry&amp;#39;s can give you two basement but that&amp;#39;s just a bug with that specific map it will hopefully be patched soon give me my big hammer my big level four Hammer no more horsing around there&amp;#39;s a bot over there but I can probably see it from up there aha I do support the monarchy in principle I&amp;#39;m sure the queen is very good at what she does whatever that is but is she not a person just like ourselves one of us one of us another shell I&amp;#39;m more RP guy myself or a

thought I had to do like a very very specific kind of damage and he was just resistant to the others for that reason a weapon&amp;#39;s intended function is almost beside the point ultimately

of artists Home Team the home team&amp;#39;s pretty good too she&amp;#39;s a sh oh enemies but now they&amp;#39;re red that means they&amp;#39;re scarier oh something&amp;#39;s red it means it&amp;#39;s infinitely scarier already red is the scary color I didn&amp;#39;t heal up all the way cuz I was looking away oops oh don&amp;#39;t reat I&amp;#39;m playing video games oh there I overshot it A&amp;#39;s not really good at this game that was 13 years old is he even really a gamer this guy&amp;#39;s going to give me advice on how to play dead by daylight I see how he plays out L man returns 2011 not a very good help us Alice save us Alice don&amp;#39;t leave us alone Alice don&amp;#39;t abandon us Alice stay with us no no no it&amp;#39;s Alice madness Returns which means I got to leave first and then come back or else it&amp;#39;s not really a return so sorry you got to burn I don&amp;#39;t make the rules I hate that I&amp;#39;ll never get used to that the hey you&amp;#39;re not allowed to jump until the the propulsion from the wind is fully or the wind of the or the spring is fully over otherwise you just kind of [ __ ] jump once or twice and just like fall be too big of an ass to allow you to just have full control over your character got to wait see yeah there&amp;#39;s a moment where her her there&amp;#39;s a moment if you&amp;#39;re watching where like her body like resets after she&amp;#39;s been propelled into the air and that&amp;#39;s when you did jump if you don&amp;#39;t if you do it beforehand you end up in a in like a pritty situation yeah this I have to play like 10 more hours of this game and I&amp;#39;m going to cry this is even like the PC ports thing this is just the game why does it eat a jump there like I don&amp;#39;t get it like why why is it eating a jump why can&amp;#39;t it just be three jumps all the time why do we have to eat jumps one of the Smash Brothers we [ __ ] just make game simple please no got to eat the second jump because [ __ ] you that&amp;#39;s why this clunky ass old ass game being old as [ __ ] being [ __ ] annoying yep oh I realize why does it eat my third jump why do I have only two jumps there and when I have three jumps over there hate this game there we go we can float afterwards it&amp;#39;s like no we&amp;#39;re we&amp;#39;re cutting off your jumps cuz we need you to float we&amp;#39;re just going to take away your third jump that you have every other [ __ ] time you&amp;#39;re doing this dumbass [ __ ] just cuz we want you to do a very oddly specific thing this time so instead of just like naturally guiding you to that we&amp;#39;re just going to have you like fail 13 million [ __ ] times to realize you have to [ __ ] float here this game is made of garbage spit and hatred yeah sorry I will play the game only the way that you have permissed sorry no I hate this video game so [ __ ] much I hate it like outright it&amp;#39;s [ __ ] garbage I get it emo icon and all that whatever my favorite thing about that game Beast is that like it&amp;#39;s not popular at all outside of the fact that it it just is controversial that game has no merit of its own to stand on it just is a [ __ ] up game so that&amp;#39;s all they care about it for something special to do around once the Bounder followed me into the ladies at I&amp;#39;m sorry to feel that way about this game it&amp;#39;s just like well it&amp;#39;s just edgy that&amp;#39;s the appeal it&amp;#39;s just edgy you going a compl I&amp;#39;m PR proud of you for clim up the Xeno rankings you should be proud of that too that&amp;#39;s really really good [ __ ] it&amp;#39;s really hard to stay up there really really hard takes a lot a lot of grinding grinding is often not very fun there was a p there was a [ __ ] platform there I&amp;#39;m straight on it and it was like nope what about this time there we go I knew cuz the purple was around my character still which means I was I was on the platform I just fell through it cuz I still had the purple Sparkles around my character H like milk was good for his time that&amp;#39;s kind of the vibe I&amp;#39;m getting I am not particularly enjoying my experience there are really nice moments and there are just like really really ass moments suppos go here here no you&amp;#39;re fine you&amp;#39;re not supposed to there are going to be Parts I don&amp;#39;t enjoy about every game I mean like doesn&amp;#39;t mean it&amp;#39;s bad I just it is what it is it&amp;#39;s not like falling an impression until I&amp;#39;m done realistically so do I put that there and then like all the way around here that okay I just want to put the thing down just builds nice I think that&amp;#39;s one of my favorite things I&amp;#39;m really excited for about this Z guys I&amp;#39;m giving people uh 16 builds to try too that&amp;#39;s something I&amp;#39;ve particularly enjoyed about the process supposed to go over here do this one Lally if the if just if the jumping felt better it would just like suddenly just like I this would be an amazing experience like most of my grip with this game is just like the fact that Alice could be directly above a platform and not land on it for like zero reason besides just [ __ ] you that&amp;#39;s why why did I fall off that platform I wasn&amp;#39;t even moving and it&amp;#39;s a flat platform why did I why did I fall off of that oh there oh these are the platforms I came from that&amp;#39;s right I was like what&amp;#39;s going on down there I wasn&amp;#39;t moving I don&amp;#39;t know how I fell off that platform no no can&amp;#39;t the jump system just [ __ ] work why is that such a hard ask if I&amp;#39;m above something I land on it like why is the feedback so terrible I don&amp;#39;t understand like why does it have to be that way I feel like if I am on top of something I I should land on it correct that that weird holy [ __ ] I run off of that I I don&amp;#39;t care for that stuff I just want out of that section h I see well that only yeah that only uh raises the thing we don&amp;#39;t need to do that anymore was say in terms of athetics is my favorite level looks really really cool like I said I wish it had AED on the side of uh you know actually being a castle layout and I just once again just discombobulated platform Shenanigans which has been the literally the entire game&amp;#39;s level design just with different like color swaps um that part was really cool oh he&amp;#39;s really big now for some reason I was try to lock on him and hit you at the same time but it didn&amp;#39;t really work out that way come they just kind of like lost track of how to like get me around the level and they&amp;#39;re just like hey why don&amp;#39;t we just have an executioner guy just teleport you 18 million times oh oh I am supposed to go down here water is walice a reflection sometimes exposes more reality than the object it echoes OB Obsession no B deal [Music] okay so it doesn&amp;#39;t move like an actual night it just kind of goes wherever the [ __ ] it wants okay [Music] where is it where is it going like how does the night move exactly and why he&amp;#39;s going to does he just Patrol back and forth I guess he just patrols back and forth I can get Alice past this guy I get him where he like but the problem is like when I move he moves now we&amp;#39;re [ __ ] there&amp;#39;s no way to keep him where he needs to go not no way but no way yet breaking the game no you&amp;#39;re fine you didn&amp;#39;t do anything you didn&amp;#39;t actually break the game at all we were we were doing the meme we&amp;#39;re doing a funny I&amp;#39;ve almost had the right idea there yeah that doesn&amp;#39;t work that cuz like if you don&amp;#39;t scoot by him he just can like [ __ ] kill us so you have to spend a certain amount of moves just getting past the horse to begin with and then you got to worry about getting to your destination yeah that&amp;#39;s kind of the [ __ ] part is like you got to like spend so many moves just avoiding the horse as Alice that like you don&amp;#39;t have enough to like figure out what&amp;#39;s going on after the fact yeah cuz the horse is just piece of [ __ ] [ __ ] he doesn&amp;#39;t turn around and kill you though so that is like that has to be the way to sneak around him no barely got to sneak past the horse but but then what happens after is like difficult you got to wait for him to go by we should have gotten mer oh yeah that way that&amp;#39;s not good you don&amp;#39;t want him there yeah you don&amp;#39;t want him there is this why people hated the section was it the platforming or was it the puzzle thing cuz I can see this also kind of like blocky for like no reason n barely yeah ni Zeno appreciate you [Music] I didn&amp;#39;t think about the idea of like that&amp;#39;s just going to kill me cuz yeah but he moves off if I do that yeah at the same time yeah we got to get both of them in it&amp;#39;s the problem [Music] that was really annoying we thinking I was like trying to use the work The Rook to my advantage instead of something that was in my way I didn&amp;#39;t know which one to use amount of moves that I had to make that thing also I can upgrade a weapon I&amp;#39;ve had enough to upgrade a weapon for a while use the blade anymore just upgrade the teapot Cannon use that a fair bit e gross get so fleshy hey look the antagonist come back come back devious evil trange this is where the magic con sends out it&amp;#39;s uh Redemption from there&amp;#39;s no time to waste there&amp;#39;s no time at all oh my God not these guys oh not the water guys that&amp;#39;s what to survive right oh oh hey I did it come Ellis don&amp;#39;t dou you&amp;#39;ve already missed the train I say the Train&amp;#39;s missing me I&amp;#39;m chasing down the train oh we&amp;#39;re just still here for some reason I I don&amp;#39;t think he&amp;#39;s supposed to still be here why is he still here like hey dude you&amp;#39;re supposed to go home once you survived the trial want to finish the job no those are the rules we do not make them go home DD perk for killer is is nowhere to hide meta I know where to hide a lot I know I don&amp;#39;t like using B potentially bad perks it&amp;#39;s just like not no fun time a lot of the time up oh my God I wish the lock on system had some sort of like contess to it that like if you were being hit or attacked by something that it would switch targets but it kind of just doesn&amp;#39;t so you just end up like camera locked on one dude that&amp;#39;s like not even remotely a threat to you while one dude across the map is like [ __ ] peppering you to death you&amp;#39;re like no I want to look at this guy right in front of me that&amp;#39;s not doing anything at the moment it&amp;#39;s not to say that like I need to run metal all the time or want to run metal all the time but I also want my perks actually be helpful otherwise I just feel like I&amp;#39;m wasting my time I think uh fer of Chase new fer of Chase is pretty fun batteries included batteries include is probably the uh the right answer to that batteries include is pretty fun just suddenly winning a Chase just barely just because you have batteries included a good feeling in general it&amp;#39;s a bad perck because it requires you chase by finish gens which you really shouldn&amp;#39;t be doing but like sometimes it just happens like fire up yeah like fire up to technically get value out of it you got to lose do poorly to get more value but like it&amp;#39;s fun so I can never get the solution to really work I think a lot of the reason is because like I don&amp;#39;t play really a whole lot of M1 kills anymore the game&amp;#39;s map design just still is in like such a like a unfun spot a lot that like that uh playing one Killers kind of feels like crap a lot so like I don&amp;#39;t end up uh is it pointing this way oh um yeah it&amp;#39;s like usually in those situations with dissolution iend know a situation where like an M2 attack would have got me the exact same like result of not not better as they going up over the pallet instead of just having the pallet just know in as I W over and getting the hit seconds later there&amp;#39;s a this in here I&amp;#39;m supposed to be able to make that jump right it doesn&amp;#39;t look like it I&amp;#39;m get bit higher but I how do I like am I making it go down quicker I doing that I didn&amp;#39;t put the thing down right to way the bomb this is no [ __ ] ate my jump so I got to do this all over again Force hesitation I feel like force hesitation only has v on Killers where like it&amp;#39;s like hard pretty like that was the right answer like like fixer or Bubba where like can&amp;#39;t the Hocus how you get the most F out of it or like en Fang uh cenite I I don&amp;#39;t it in theory works I just personally be I&amp;#39;ll get ey out of it for whatever reason I think people just I think people generally know that likeing up against o is not a good idea so like I don&amp;#39;t get a lot of people grouped up very often CR the screen few find the way some don&amp;#39;t recognize it when they do some don&amp;#39;t ever want to oh he gets caught by that guy if I do that it&amp;#39;s interesting they can&amp;#39;t attack you from that side not funny there we go oh it was way easier than the other one I didn&amp;#39;t start the [Music] Lizzy hated locked rooms her room was further from the fire than mine smoke could not have killed her she never locked her door and besides she knew another way out of the house out of the window th someone incapacitated or killed Lizzy then locked her door then took the lamp downstairs and started the fire to cover up their crime their plan was to kill us all it&amp;#39;s our therapist I it&amp;#39;s like there&amp;#39;s more than one person with those round glasses be a minut but kind of look like our therapist then who was fun oh thank you my horse back Alice your hair is black did you know that what insulting talk should never go unchallenged Alice did you know if you like living you should not die oh cool thanks for the advice Alice make sure to do your taxes or else that is tax evasion thanks sh cat you work for the government now the IRS what are you looking at stop breaking the fourth wall look away just getting [ __ ] on like [ __ ] see me that we behind me that went behind me how did that happen that was funny think the game is like please stop cheating like that&amp;#39;s for cheesing us jez I did too yeah I don&amp;#39;t understand how people are been super harsh on version they did a really good job for not having your likeness and that was not their fault food looms large in your dreams Alice but cake occupies a special place never rejected deser I suspect nor tea if cake was on offer cake I love that manand amze wow you have lactose and tolerance hope you&amp;#39;re taking good care of them good job D you before the Executioner guy chases me down well I was hoping the horse would get a little bit faster when I fully leveled up but it&amp;#39;s still pretty slow I said we see that what happened Alice is the milk over time it learned it evolved it adapted said I&amp;#39;m tired of being drank and went to the gym started training now it&amp;#39;s got hands he came out with his back B and he&amp;#39;s like hey here give me a chance first WR yep salt Shaker&amp;#39;s best weapon he does that I&amp;#39;ll just be like thinking and like just tapping my leg just as I think and it&amp;#39;ll be like that hand belongs to me oh you think you said Color Guard like look at those moves I get EX opinion I know there are multiple color guard people in chat what is this form like oh my God there&amp;#39;s a bush here eat me don&amp;#39;t do it it&amp;#39;s mine good spe and all that went to your hips huh [Music] this game has not had a hint of humor the entire almost 12 hours I&amp;#39;ve played it that was SW out of left field but I&amp;#39;m here for it oh my gosh I&amp;#39;m huge oh while giant by ping or pounding ATT the Queen&amp;#39;s Towers to expose her heart I have there is still not a really good Godzilla sooner out there so I guess this this will be my second best he this maze oh no I can&amp;#39;t destroy maze look at them all yo I&amp;#39;m really glad that they decided not to bring out the entire Army on me like that while I was uh small been kind of unfair literally old smash I took so much damage from that what the whole point of being giant was to feel powerful yeah get out of the chest Club nerd how is this is this a lot of people&amp;#39;s worth level I I think it&amp;#39;s my favorite so

as mad as a hat poor de worst is over and over and over forget it Alice forget it oh sorry wasn&amp;#39;t supposed to do that can&amp;#39;t distinguish reality from illusion remember your last journey

what the word is like there&amp;#39;s a lot of interchangeable parts so like modular that&amp;#39;s what I&amp;#39;m looking for very modular yeah compared to like the earlier levels this is feels like where the game actually starts it feels like these like last levels have been are like way more fun ones I was just like [ __ ] around for the first like like 10 hours of the game now

to chees again we going to go through the window no why do you just fall go forward going to actively break the game then boy CW off when I actually get stuck [Music] no no why is it just knocking me off I have the right idea I just need the execution B me for being [Music] stupid I have no idea where to go now like ironically outside of the meme I&amp;#39;m trying to get through that window like you can&amp;#39;t go through here go through there you go back but like just Pur platforms you can&amp;#39;t get back up to them me I guess I could just fall and die and it&amp;#39;ll probably respa me where I need to vaguely [Music] go like you see the goober be over there oh it just put me right back here huh okay I guess I was evidently supposed to be able to reach that this whole time oh I see oh that&amp;#39;s the thing I blew up there we go okay that platform that just seems to Pride actually wasn&amp;#39;t isue oh [ __ ] hello oh oh [ __ ] hello oh no edges to this uh battle arena slipped off and what the where did you come from I taking care of all y&amp;#39;all yeah throw bombs at your own friend wa got yeah you got a little stuck there oh a lot I can see him the mighty dark has been lifted yeah I&amp;#39;m moved I&amp;#39;m no longer live where I live before the the soundproofing will go back up eventually it&amp;#39;s just see working progress should be happens you got to got to get good as they say where&amp;#39;s this hog is the second to last level oh are you trying to get me to just beat it one night where is this yeah it&amp;#39;s kind of hard sometimes to tell between like the pig sorting and like enemies growling especially during the uh aquita Hearts level the I appreciate it staring at it oh it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s her nose that&amp;#39;s cute that&amp;#39;s smart that&amp;#39;s adorable yeah it it&amp;#39;s her nose p now just new I really on the nose with that one is you just got here hit me the prime i h appreciate that though I&amp;#39;ll try to make that worth well thank you it&amp;#39;s very considerate take a bite out of that one sorry here NOS in the pl business uhhuh H do Wilson&amp;#39;s not fooled Alice discipline must be maintained clean my favorite doctor whatever you&amp;#39;ve imagined about electrical current it&amp;#39;s more half of it it could be a persuasive teacher strict mind demanding what a snier where&amp;#39;d you get a whiff of that one little more hours H [Music] intriguing I don&amp;#39;t think I would have beat it too what I do a bad no [Music] woo what is truly sld is most often found if it is findable I like how often it was separated there I thought you were really cool you yes I am I&amp;#39;m actually making the Zeno guide right now I have uh i l have one more section to do which is the map cheer list and I&amp;#39;m done so that will probably be that this week right I&amp;#39;ll try to have that out soon use it obviously I&amp;#39;ll be here I&amp;#39;m not playing dbd today but I do play DVD most of the time I can answer your questions and stuff W that almost got me a little hung up there [Music] please oh the slide oh oh my oh my gosh they hate her cuz she&amp;#39;s a zenos hated because it&amp;#39;s a very oppressive anti- Chase killer that&amp;#39;s why oppressive anti- Chase is always is like really hard to deal with it&amp;#39;s kind of something that&amp;#39;s like objectively strong you know and her counter play is very particular cuz you have that to put down the turrets so if you just it&amp;#39;s not like other character like if you all right choose uh to learn the counter playay you are just going to eat [ __ ] you know you kind of can&amp;#39;t just freeball it and call it a day go to learn character specific stuff which I know a lot of players AR into bye like it&amp;#39;s see below me or through a wall but this point not steal in the world kind scary oh you&amp;#39;re right here that was explosive that enough for that final upgrade not final but second the VY you sneeze yeah that&amp;#39;s what it was yeah essentially I&amp;#39;m Bo of making it like inconvenient for the zomorph to uh sure whatever whatever they&amp;#39;re trying to pressure whether be you and a Chase or like a Jen make them have to go out of the way to break said thing that&amp;#39;s where you find a lot of success This Ss pretty cool I like how it&amp;#39;s like a constantly moving dollhous I got to find maybe a piece of my mind you know there&amp;#39;s some how to counter like how like good places to place turrets oh I [ __ ] that timing there&amp;#39;s stuff like that in there in the flame tur section which I know that&amp;#39;s something I don&amp;#39;t see in other character guides because I&amp;#39;ve looked at other character guides to make mine they&amp;#39;re just like ah we&amp;#39;re not giving the secret how to beat us that&amp;#39;s kind figure that out for yourselves you think I&amp;#39;m letting you in on that just so you can beat me easier you don&amp;#39;t get it I&amp;#39;m the number one DVD player of all time I&amp;#39;m not letting anybody beat me even if that&amp;#39;s fairly we got two that what does that mean oh I was like oh my brain&amp;#39;s like oh do I need that do I need to go get that no nope nope I is that why you&amp;#39;ve been so silent oh my gosh we like your laugh though we

the same for your parents why did you say that to a child okay thanks for the assist appreciate it uh okay all right makes sense to me the floor facing spikes hurt me from the side there got me I&amp;#39;m a dollhous any be careful Al in the window was that it all you got okay I wasn&amp;#39;t being careful before but now I definitely will now that you&amp;#39;ve said something that speeduns I feel like those like depending on what they qualify for speedrun cuz like there&amp;#39;s a lot of like side quest and stuff oh interesting I know that what about that interestes you yeah real estly I don&amp;#39;t see espe made with that much money kind of lawyers he can afford getting in much trouble unfortunately I clearly made it through but it&amp;#39;s kind of like like nah but cuz the side counts so got to be careful about the side up um I actually do need two for this oh no this one isit that&amp;#39;s weird that&amp;#39;s just kind of like a trick oh this is just another one of these you sure I&amp;#39;m close to theend I still feel so far away from everything you see that I just kind of face through the [ __ ] thing that was funny like n you perish halfway [Music] through h I can also just up myself see how many like how much play time I have left much I&amp;#39;ve been following it&amp;#39;s all a it&amp;#39;s a very very like so like a lot of the legitimacy of it been thrown up in the air a lot of it is like you know well he clearly did it but he&amp;#39;s avoiding it with like money it&amp;#39;s like there&amp;#39;s a lot of [Music] different let&amp;#39;s see all right um honestly I might call it there with about halfway through this level because like I&amp;#39;m pretty tired um and sometimes the game has been known to like grind my gears so like if it I don&amp;#39;t think I have it in me to like push through and finish it if there&amp;#39;s like two or three hours left and we finish it early next week we can just go into dead by daylight afterwards um yeah we can just go into dead by daylight afterwards because I&amp;#39;m just tired I don&amp;#39;t really have the um yeah we we we were considering probably trying to finish it tonight but like I knowing that there is so much more so much more ahead of us like I don&amp;#39;t know I&amp;#39;m not necessarily looking forward to uh trying to like quot unquote like puff it out so to speak you

iracing.com [Music] n [Music] the last great Coliseum in Motorsports the half mile oval in Tennessee and for week number four of Apex Sim racing we&amp;#39;re coming to you live from Bristol Motor Speedway it&amp;#39;s the Apex Sim racing Cup Series live on vped things are about to get really good as we go short track racing in the daytime welcome in everybody I&amp;#39;m your host Bradley Cooper all season long we&amp;#39;ll be covering this event Apex Sim putting on a fantastic first three weeks and we come up here on week number four if there&amp;#39;s any tempers if there&amp;#39;s any bad blood it&amp;#39;s going to be settled here it is impossible to escape one another as this racetrack founded back in 1960 has stayed the same the only thing they&amp;#39;ve added to it is Grand stands it&amp;#39;s been a concrete surface since its Inception and here today we&amp;#39;re going to find out what the iRacing Service is like around this 53 Mi of 30° banking it&amp;#39;s been compared to to a gymnasium with cars inside of it think a look at our schedule and it&amp;#39;s week four we go on to Darlington next week another tight groved unique race track that track just over a mile then we have a track just under a mile in Iowa on the 30th to finish out March we go on to do Charlotte Nashville and Talladega to finish out our regular season and then our five race playoff begins May 18th as you can see they&amp;#39;re all the way down to Championship night at Homestead so three races completed Phoenix Raceway did not disappoint either a lot of drivers back and forth we had some tempers flare up there some drivers maybe not getting the finishes that they deserved in that race but overall it&amp;#39;s Eddie Smith who takes over the points lead by 12 points over Chuck Stevens Bame falls out of that points lead back to third garri ker after his win is in fourth position we have four different or three different winners this season Dylan Bates trying to find his way back to Victory Lane as well will it come here or is it somewhere in the near future quite a few fast drivers but winless here with Eddie Smith he is leading the points and I can guarantee you Eddie Smith is fast at this racetrack so if there&amp;#39;s a chance of a victory it could come right here at Bristol race analysis up on your screen it will be 150 laps here today stage lap at lap 45 35 mph Pit Road speed limit a very unique Pit Road as they will be pitting on the front and back straight away here we have enough cars to do that not enough pit stalls on that front stretch for all 27 of these cars that are trying to start here tonight so we will see drivers have to pick and choose uh their Prime moment to get to Pit Road it&amp;#39;s going to be rather difficult as H you can lose track of the front and back stretch just track very symmetrical and uh very very many times we&amp;#39;ve seen here on vs speed guys will come down the wrong entry on pit Lane and get a uh pass through penalty it&amp;#39;s happened to me personally so two green white Checkers and 70% fuel here today on the iRacing fix setup should get about 125 laps of fuel roughly here tonight so we will be just short of that finish is guaranteed they&amp;#39;re going to have to come down Pit Road for at least one stop here today but the likelihood of them staying green well you know it here on vssp spe we&amp;#39;ve seen it here before it&amp;#39;s a tight Groove racing you&amp;#39;re going to be side by side nose to tail the whole time it&amp;#39;s going to be rather difficult to stay off one another but with that it&amp;#39;s time to go track side and get the grid up on your scen screen starting grid here presented by American grit apparel Co like to apologize to them for last week but we have it up this week starting on the poll here tonight with a 14 433 it&amp;#39;s Jesse Winnington and the number 94 he beats Dylan Bates by almost a half a tenth of a second 500s of a second ahead be exact uh probably 70 100s of a second I think that&amp;#39;s quick math look that pans out row number two goes to Eric Tracy and AJ Rogers in the 88 Cody Bame and Noah Carman will start fifth and sixth position then you have Tracy passin Garrett Kinder a winner here in the series in these three races Elliot Carlson and Christian Deadman deadmond one of those drivers that probably deserved a better finish than he got at Phoenix looking to name himself here in week number four row number six goes to Christopher hen Kieran and church will start in 12 13th position goes to Rick rub Brandon Wallace in the 99 and 14th 15th Jason lotridge Aaron Adcock the league owner he&amp;#39;ll start in 16th position there&amp;#39;s Chuck Stevens in second in points he&amp;#39;ll start 17th here today and your leader in points right next to him Eddie Smith starting in 18 with a 14 730 Josh Oswald and damy Jones will start in row number 10 and eight cars left to talk about with Daniel Holt and Chuck Felts starting 21st 22nd 23rd Chris mclan Dana Shepard and 24th 25th Ray Rogers Allan Smith these drivers electing not to take a time in qualifying Matt Rogers and Anthony Edrington in 28th position here tonight they rolling around for our two Pace laps here today Winnington going to lead them into turn one he has Dylan Bates looking for his second win of the Season Jesse Winnington another one of those drivers that was having success at Phoenix but I believe was under the weather during that event it wasn&amp;#39;t last week it was the week before that but he was definitely running a fever wasn&amp;#39;t feeling the greatest was not in the Discord to pull him up into the broadcast Booth but it looks like maybe this week we&amp;#39;ll have an opportunity maybe not feeling any better as he&amp;#39;s out here on the racetrack we&amp;#39;re not seeing a Jesse Winnington in the Discord so hopefully he&amp;#39;s feeling a little bit better as we get set to tea off week number four Apex Sim racing about to be underway pace car will pull off this time around and here we go for 150 laps green flag is out an apex Sim Cup Series [Music] underway oh and Cody Bane loses it here on the front stretch there&amp;#39;s the left front off the car no caution will stay green but that car is broken he can&amp;#39;t steer it anymore not the start that he wanted he&amp;#39;s going to have to pull it down Road right out of the gate we come down the front stretch for lap one he gets loose off of turn four to the inside wall and here on our Jak K Kinder Ranch farman Ranch wreckage rewind loses control here and down Pit Road does have that fast repair Dylan Bates took the lead away from your B center right away on the start just shot out of a cannon and Jesse Winnington has been looking to get it back ever since he&amp;#39;ll look to the inside now nothing there on that velocity 91 he&amp;#39;ll look again to the inside side by side for the top spot down the backstretch and we&amp;#39;ll get a look here from our Chopper camera 91 prevails 88 to the outside of AJ Rogers he&amp;#39;s up two positions started back in fourth spot he&amp;#39;ll take it to the outside of the 94 just behind him you have some cars up in the wall I believe that&amp;#39;s the 14 of Noah Carman that just tagged the wall the 53 of Tracy passons on board with the 53 car and passing&amp;#39;s in that button up right now that&amp;#39;s got to be overheating him I don&amp;#39;t know how he&amp;#39;s able to do that as we&amp;#39;re looking three wide for the top spot right now just a moment there we saw three wide a glimpse by the 88 of Rogers on the outside of baates and that allowed Jesse Winnington to get back up to Second spot 88 Tagg the wall there he&amp;#39;ll get back to the right rear quarter Winnington holds [Music] on so they compare it to a gymnasium with Carter in it I compare it to throwing shoes in the dryer this track will beat you up you are continuously turning breaking adjusting micro Corrections all over this Racetrack and it&amp;#39;s hot today weather up on your screen 99° on a concrete surface it is very slippery out there and you can see trying to keep that car on the bottom for Jesse Winnington has proven difficult as Dy Bates pulls away 88 takes over to the second spot pass in to the outside or inside rather of the 67 of Eric Tracy that was for the top five and into the wall for passin wasn&amp;#39;t clear came up across the nose of the 13 of ker will go back on our vped instant replay the wreckage rewind you&amp;#39;ll see right here he gets to the inside of the 67 doesn&amp;#39;t get [Music] clear and the very next turn it looks like Kinder comes well he had no room to go there was no room left deeper in this field though a driver that&amp;#39;s worked up six spots already Eddie Smith I said he was going to be bad fast tonight well that proves it right there in 17 laps six positions and he&amp;#39;s working on cracking the top 10 he&amp;#39;s in 12th right now in the 87 [Music] see the 24 of Christopher Henner he gets by on the outside that&amp;#39;s Cody bamee who went two laps down he did use a fast repair the car is back in tiptop shape unfortunately for him though he loses a lot of ground and he&amp;#39;s waiting for a caution come out that hasn&amp;#39;t happen back here with another velocity motor Sports driver I believe with Jason lotridge he has about 9/10 of a second almost a full second back from Eddie Smith in 13th position Davy Jones getting passed by the one of Josh Oswald Ray Rogers side by side he&amp;#39;ll get by Daniel holdcraft for 16 deeper in this field it&amp;#39;s still a hornet&amp;#39;s [Music] nest 20 laps complete already here in Tennessee in the top five top six still right on top of each other all within a second starting to migrate up the racetrack as well outside line looks like it&amp;#39;s working enough for the 88 of Rogers but that will burn more fuel we were talking about 125 laps roughly he&amp;#39;ll lose a couple it&amp;#39;s not going to hurt him overall I think this is a One-Stop race if we stay green so far so good as we come up a lap 25 Jesse Winnington CH still oh contact in the back here Garrett Kinder and Kinder&amp;#39;s around the 53 of passes into the wall and CAU is out Tracy passing an innocent bystandard there he is collected in our first yellow at lap 26 right there you catch the tail end of this incident we&amp;#39;ll back it up even further the 99 of Brandon wall just nowhere to go there&amp;#39;s the contact between Kinder and the 14 of Noah Carman and just nowhere to go for these guys behind ride on board here with the 99 he sees it happening he&amp;#39;s on the brakes he&amp;#39;s still on the brakes trying to get this thing wed up just not enough this so down Pit Road for the 99 a few drivers electing to stay out Noah Carman did come down Pit Road and get some of that damage repaired Eddie Smith came into pits as well four tires in a full tank of fuel for the 87 Brandon Wallace gets his damage repaired some of it repaired Christian deadmond also with a little bit of damage and Cody Bame should be the Lucky Pass recipient he is and he will have one lap he is the only car a lap down here at Bristol light should go out on the pace car this time by we will rack them back up double fou looks like the 99 of Bates is going to choose the outside that he naturally had at the start of this race and it panned out well it worked out exactly the way he had planned the flashing lights turn off here on lap 29 we&amp;#39;ll go back green on lap 30 coming up on a quarter of a way through this race nice stent of green flag racing still still you have to wonder with racking them back up on older tires how would this pan out Mates is going to have to get an excellent restart as you look back at this field of 28 cars pace car out of the way Apex second time at Bristol green flag is out and another quick shot out of the cannon here excellent move here by Dylan Bates to choose the outside Eric Tracy up to second position Here Comes Jesse Winnington to the inside of the 88 again they&amp;#39;re starting on the pole he has not led a single lap here today tough break so far for the 94 team [Music] [Music] D bites continues to pull out that lead it&amp;#39;s over half a second on lap 35 will come across cross the stripe to start that lap now they take away relatively quickly last time by a 14791 fastest car on the racetrack is the 91 of Dylan Bates meanwhile deeper in this field you got Aon adock Christopher Henri seventh and eighth position up eight spots here for the 17 most positions gain go to this driver Ray Rogers from 25th up to ninth 16 positions in that short amount of [Music] time you&amp;#39;ll seeing that side by side up there for the third position Winnington still hasn&amp;#39;t been able to clear on the 88 and while this is happening Eric Tracy is starting to pull away he&amp;#39;s losing ground to the lead but he&amp;#39;s pulling away from these guys side by side ends now and here comes kinder to the inside for the fifth position he picked up a little bit of damage from that last incident but continues to stay out as long as the steering&amp;#39;s still good on this car he stands a chance and he will get up into the top five tags the wall a little bit there through one and two side by side behind that it&amp;#39;s Ray Rogers going to the inside Aaron adock on The High Line a little contact there with the 51 on board with the [Music] 17 the quarter of the way done here from Bristol Tennessee battles on this racetrack with Matt Rogers trying to get around the 96 or actually Noah Carman going around the 96 the five of Chris mlan so two spots lost there for Matt Rogers they will lose another one here as he gets into the wall the two of Daniel Hol to the bottom lotr side by side goes by on the outside of Dana Shepard and just behind him Stone by for 12th position and the caution is out for the stage y almost got me off guard stage winner though right here Dylan Bates getting stage number one top 10 on the left hand side of your screen and congratulations to Dylan Bates in the number 91 he&amp;#39;ll bring him down Pit Road and we&amp;#39;ll wrap back around the front straight away stage number one complete as the 91 goes left sides Up 77 really close here out of Pit Road but it&amp;#39;s Rogers Smith Eddie Smith stays out here he came in and got four tires earlier in this run about 27 lap difference on this stin he himself up to

back here live at Bristol you haven&amp;#39;t missed much we just took the green flag but what you did Miss was Dylan Bates getting to the inside of Eddie Smith who stayed out after that caution for the the stage stage one goes to the 91 of baates and oh my goodness a bunch of contact in baates into the outside wall he drifts it and saves it incredible driving by the 91 of Bates but he&amp;#39;s probably not happy with Eddie Smith we need to go back and unpack this Smith gets a run on the outside [Music] well Smith had the run and baates come up across his nose I don&amp;#39;t think he was quite clear there we&amp;#39;ll back this up one more time ah just not a good angle we&amp;#39;ll try to get it from the chopper camera take a look at it from this angle maybe we get a better look at it but yeah Smith has a run but Bates is clear that is a tough call Great save though oh and we got trouble in front of him ation is out and it&amp;#39;s the 96 I believe 81 of Rick rubbe also involved at the 96 heavy damage Elliot Carlson in the 09 and just like that on lap 57 we&amp;#39;re back under yellow this is on board with Elliot Carlson [Music] other drivers doing a great job rub actually avoided this entirely but there&amp;#39;s the 24 off the- wall to cause this that&amp;#39;s Christopher hin will watch on board with the 24 [Music] just like that we go back under caution drivers came down Pit Road so I think this is a chance here to pull up Dylan bites Dylan Bates It&amp;#39;s Bradley Cooper in the vped booth you got a copy I gotta Dylan uh great save there I got to say that was an excellent drive to save that car but how did you feel there coming off a turn four how how did you feel about that uh I don&amp;#39;t feel too good about it to be honest with you I&amp;#39;m not really sure what that was all about he was on 10 15 lap older tires than us and I just went up and took his Lane and he never took a attempt to cross me over again underneath me or anything and just wrecked us so I don&amp;#39;t really understand that but uh guess we&amp;#39;ll keep digging see if we can get back up there 25th position he started up front but you uh shouldn&amp;#39;t have much of a problem getting back up there his car looks bad fast tonight yeah let&amp;#39;s hope so well good luck out there and maybe we&amp;#39;ll get to talk to you for your second win 10 four appreciate it stage one winner velocity Motorsports driver Dylan Bates getting ready to restart here from 25th position so Eddie Smith is the leader now he has Jesse Winnington to the inside he also has the 88 of AJ Rogers the 13 of Garrett Kinder but Eddie Smith not making any friends out here early have to wait and see how it all pans out here on lap 61 as we go back green race recap with three lead changes and three cautions two of those being official cautions and here goes Eddie Smith into turn one Winnington already on the bottom looks to the inside Kinder into the wall [Music] Kinder&amp;#39;s actually able to get to the outside as the 94 wington got a little bit loose there through the exit of turn two he&amp;#39;ll fall back in line looking back here deeper in the field some side by side with the 14 the 75 and the 78 and there&amp;#39;s passet who got caught up in the first first one 14 who got caught up in the second one we had a couple incidents here tonight that did not bring out the yellows we stayed green with the 78 he got loose he&amp;#39;s going to get loose again car in the wall just ahead of them they&amp;#39;re three wide here at Bristol here Church got a piece of the wall Allan Smith also falling back it is a hornet&amp;#39;s nest and the caution is out Elliot Carlson involved in another one here with the leaders back on the replay has the 77 of Edrington behind him contact coming out of turn two sideways for the 09 Loops it around locks it down and this happens just in front of Eddie Smith and he comes back up on the racetrack Carlson almost takes Eddie Smith out back this up one more time right on board with the 87 here&amp;#39;s the contact he locks it down on the inside that&amp;#39;s what you want to do here he doesn&amp;#39;t want to go a lap down and so he pulls up on the racetrack Smith has to make invasive Maneuvers and as does the rest of the field so the over and under on cautions I talked to some of these drivers in the pre-race they said the number was seven so will exclude the stage break we&amp;#39;re at four so three official we only have four more to go coming up on that halfway Point here from Bristol Dylan Bates looking to get his way back to the front as he had a little bit of a get together with Eddie Smith early in this race halfway through here at Bristol more coverage of Apex Sim

Tennessee we&amp;#39;re on board here with AJ Rogers who&amp;#39;s restarting just behind Eddie Smith green flag is out and we&amp;#39;re back [Music] underway Eddie Smith Under Fire from Garrick Kinder already has a win this season and the 13 car with that left front damage doesn&amp;#39;t seem to be hindering the Kinder machine at all coming up on exactly the halfway mark Cody Bame who spun out to start off lap one is just outside the top 10 Eric Tracy sideways and Tracy loses it everyone able to avoid it no we have another car involved it&amp;#39;s the 19 and they were squeezing through there like a cheese grader to try to avoid that with the 19 Car of Christian deadmond trying to find a Clos pit we&amp;#39;ll back this up a little bit more take a look at what happened to the 67 he&amp;#39;s coming out of turn four where this happens it&amp;#39;s a little bit loose right here over correction slides it sideways locks it down as best as he can man the 19 we got to go on board with him [Music] you&amp;#39;re going to see quite a few drivers get skinny right [Music] here the 19 unfortunately runs into the back I believe that was the three of Allan Smith that he ran into the back of from the chopper camera so Eddie Smith continues to hold on to the lead there try to find the 19 Deadman doesn&amp;#39;t appear that deadmond is in the Discord here tonight yes he is so we&amp;#39;ll check in here I think we&amp;#39;re doubling back up we&amp;#39;ll leave Deadman alone for now he&amp;#39;s getting damage repaired there very short cautions here it is very difficult to hit a replay button and pull a driver up I know that we have opportunities to talk to the to talk to these drivers during these cautions it&amp;#39;s a lot easier at Talladega I can give you that as we get set to go back green on lap 78 past the halfway mark and Eddie Smith in the lead 91 of dilles back up to 13th here side by side behind these two as Kinder got to the back bumper he&amp;#39;ll look to the inside for the lead gets loose off of four and how about this almost into the top five for Chris mlan he&amp;#39;ll look to the high line here on the eight car velocity Motorsports driver Jason lotridge VMS on the prow pushing through this top five I want to say five out of the 10 cars in the top 10 little baites look to the inside there briefly on Aaron Adcock it&amp;#39;s actually four and oh trouble between teammates and the 91 of Dylan Bates is involved involved problems between teammates down the front stretch and that&amp;#39;s going to bring out another yellow here today we&amp;#39;re at six backs him up with a knock Chuck Stevens the 53 of passin also involved but let&amp;#39;s go up front and figure out what happened to the 78 car he&amp;#39;s already had to burn his fast repair tonight he&amp;#39;s going to get to the inside the PO man Motorsports driver Chris mlan who had cracked the top five here mlan gets sideways takes him to the inside and nowhere to go for everyone else on board with Chuck [Music] Stevens we&amp;#39;re going to get a quick word here with Cody Bame in the number 78 machine Cody this race has not been kind to you thus far no not at all not at all it&amp;#39;s been a rough one right here but you know it&amp;#39;s kind of one of those races that we kind of expect things to not go our way Bristol has been proven to be a rough RAC trck are the tempers flaring out there tonight uh my tempers have about uh hit a boiling point here but you know I screwed myself in the beginning no doubt and then uh I don&amp;#39;t know the five car bounced it off the wall and took us out sure it wasn&amp;#39;t intentional but just pisses me off man I understand that I understand that entirely but yeah try to get some damage repaired I know you had to burn that fast repair on that first one a little mistake this car looks like it&amp;#39;s a a little bit of a handful here tonight yeah yeah it&amp;#39;s these cars kind of suck and this track kind of sucks anymore since they reconfigured it so it is what it is well I&amp;#39;ll put you back down there velocity Motorsports try to stay locked in you never know what could happen here hey thank youy B velocity Motorsports driver had the points lead here briefly as we&amp;#39;re doubled back up with Eddie Smith and AJ Rogers Josh Oswald Jason lotridge and Dana Shepard into the top five for the 44 first time tonight as we get set to go back green Bas car out of the way a lot of damage front ends as you can see through this field back [Music] underway and Eddie Smith wastes no time the one car though of Josh Oswald does take full advantage he&amp;#39;ll get around his teammate and take it to the outside of the 88 car he&amp;#39;s going to get around two teammates and take it up to second position on this restart maybe he has some offense and remember this is Dylan bates&amp;#39;s [Music] teammate look to the inside again lap 90 coming up Eddie Smith has led for 42 of the 90 laps that were about to complete about to be 43 of those 90 complete as he&amp;#39;ll come off turn four older tires here 20 laap difference to Josh Oswald Ray Rogers Cartman Carman rather in the wall he fell out of the top five he is slowly losing positions Noah Carman to the inside of the 44 the 22 Here Comes Kieran Church to the outside the 67 of Eric Tracy spots being lost left and right here for the 14 car little bit of a blinking issue there for the 91 hard competitive racing Kevin Kinder I have used everything you said in the chat here tonight keep the on liners coming cars into the wall with the five of Chris mlan mlan bounced the wall early got into Cody Bame B not very happy with it and caution is out looks like Rick rubbe involved backwards out of turn two I think this is a couple different cars in this incident we&amp;#39;ll back this up to get confirmation our wreckage [Music] rewind knock to the inside 81 a little bit of neet code there not on Aaron iock at all would definitely chalk that one up to just a little bit of a connection bubble times that happens on the iRacing service unfortunately when it does happen it can take some cars out watch right here there&amp;#39;s some contact that is not neet code that is definite contact that is Aaron atock saying I&amp;#39;m faster let me buy but here to the inside that is net code you can see the Gap there between these two cars and we&amp;#39;ll ride on board with the 17 you&amp;#39;re going to see this [Music] contact you&amp;#39;re going to see this contact that doesn&amp;#39;t happen and unfortunately for Aaron adock that means he too is going to have to burn this fast repair and we have a moment to bring another driver up into the broadcast Booth so we are going to pull the 17 of Aaron Adcock it looked like a lot of contact there maybe trying to get around that machine in the 81 but uh the net coat that&amp;#39;s what I want to chalk that up to on that one I got you yeah I didn&amp;#39;t know what happened I just knew I I saw him kind of high and I dove it down to the bottom to get around and next thing I know I was spinning I was like man I didn&amp;#39;t think you know I thought we had a whole lot more room than that so I hadn&amp;#39;t had a chance to look at it and see what happened but um if it was my fault I&amp;#39;m sorry if it wasn&amp;#39;t oh well well on my screen it looked like net code there was some contact prior to that a couple times but in the words of Denny Hamlin that&amp;#39;s short track racing yeah it&amp;#39;s Bristol baby well so far we&amp;#39;ve had uh we&amp;#39;re we&amp;#39;re approaching that uh over and under that I was talking about earlier and uh we&amp;#39;ll subtract one for that stage break but good luck here Aaron and I know that it&amp;#39;s been rough but hopefully you can get back up front yeah man I appreciate it we&amp;#39;re going to try home Motorsports driver Aaron Adcock about to take the green flag here from Bristol so Eddie Smith his teammate up front with the one of oswal to the inside into the Geico restart Zone we go seven cautions three lead changes from Bristol here tonight [Music] and Eddie Smith on older tires we&amp;#39;re talking about 72 Laps on this St probably around 50 under green 45 to 50 no one has contested him and he pulls out to half a second Josh Oswell gets to the inside of lotridge you&amp;#39;re looking off the back end of Eddie Smith he continues to lead this race 52 laps LED that&amp;#39;s half of the laps completed here and a shepher to the outside of Derek Kinder Kinder with that damage still not slowed down Shepard also with a little bit of front end damage a matter of who can handle it better 51 of Ray Rogers into the top 10 he started back in 25th this driver has been gaining positions all race long we talked about him earlier now it&amp;#39;s 18 spots gained up to seven [Music] their P sitter Jesse Winnington to the inside here and Dana Shepard the biggest gainer right now with 19 spots game but I think he&amp;#39;s going to lose a position to the 51 here soon enough if Winnington can get clear meanwhile we have a battle for the lead heating up Eddie Smith down the two10 of a second very quickly how Josh Oswald has caught up he&amp;#39;s finding the weak spot he&amp;#39;s going to press on it middle line through three and four across the stripe loses a little bit of time there on that exit but Smith on the wall riding that safer barrier ker still trying to get around for third position you got clear of Winnington he&amp;#39;s trying to take third away car around in the background that&amp;#39;s Chris mlan caution is out and we&amp;#39;re at our Mark of seven cautions here today 88 involved as well of shephard I apologize is not Shephard the 88 machine of Roger he got the aftermath of this I&amp;#39;m not sure exactly the 84 got a piece of it as well there must have been multiple incidents we&amp;#39;re going to have to unpack all this a lot going on here&amp;#39;s the 88 he gets into the 91 there&amp;#39;s the 84 this all starts way ahead of this marker five of mlan across the nose and this happens after the fact passin Bates Kier in church Chuck Stevens and I&amp;#39;m not sure who that was behind Chuck Stevens it looks like the 10 machine Dave Jones all involved in this nowhere to go David Jones crawling

here Kinder It&amp;#39;s Bradley Cooper in The V speed Booth you got a copy yeah what&amp;#39;s going on well it took you a while but you finally found the weak spot you pressed on it quite a few times you take over the lead here with about 40 to go and it&amp;#39;s going to be about 30 to go when we go back green yeah uh car&amp;#39;s feeling pretty good I think I pit at the right time for tires was able to take advantage of them a couple guys pit got on my way and got me up to Second and uh luckily I had a nose out in front whenever that caution flew so got me up here in front of Eddie and uh we&amp;#39;re going to try and hold on to it you will be the command car for this restart but so far so good looking for that second win here in just four weeks what are the odds uh

going into the corner on the high side and I got turned you know different bring points I get it I&amp;#39;m not going to blame anybody I don&amp;#39;t even I don&amp;#39;t really even know what happened there well it looked like the8 car got loose coming off the exit of the corner Jason lotridge uh Rec corrected it across your nose took you up to the outside wall and then the 24 was of Henner was just to your outside and that&amp;#39;s what sent him up over the wall yeah I know the previous one but I&amp;#39;m talking about the one that were on right now I don&amp;#39;t I

miscommunication between uh a couple cars Dylan Bates was involved with that the T of Davey Jones but we&amp;#39;re doubled back up Chuck Felts anybody want to shout out while we have you in the booth yeah definitely you and uh B speed for you guys definitely and at Apex and Jimmy and all my teammates I me m respect to all you guys Chuck Felts going to restart here in 16th position we still have some racing left to be done I see Winnington will be the command car I believe Kinder no I don&amp;#39;t I think Kinder might have it here on the outside I think he maintain this lead the 94 was never able to clear Eddie Smith and it looks like he&amp;#39;s going to have him to his outside again on this re start 17 laps to go from Bristol Smith Falls back to third Winnington going on offense now trying to get around the 13 and caution is out again Alan Smith is around Smith comes up across the nose but trying to get an idea of what happened he comes up across the 77 of Edrington Alan Smith

driver we&amp;#39;re going to bring up into the broadcast Booth it&amp;#39;s the 67 of Eric Tracy who finishes in third you were up in the top five you were able to avoid a lot of the things that happened out here tonight but you you kept your car clean uh one of the few drivers I think that ended up with less than a 2X here tonight uh yeah I mean I I Had My Moments too I I I self spun once so that was that wasn&amp;#39;t ideal but but uh but outside of that yeah I had I had a fairly clean race and uh you know everything worked out well I I was I was pretty tight on that setup I I couldn&amp;#39;t I as long as I could run around the top I could I could run with everybody but if I had to run the middle or bottom I was I was in trouble but we lued out and U managed to managed to get it in the top three well Eric we go back to the start of this race you started in third you finish in third not a bad day when you consider the venue that we&amp;#39;re at tonight no no I I I will I&amp;#39;ll take it and uh you know we&amp;#39;ll we&amp;#39;ll uh consider it a good night and and move on and we&amp;#39;ll we&amp;#39;ll see what happens from here on out well we have another tough track it&amp;#39;s the one uh that kind of goes as by too tough to tame Darlington Ray s is uh is there anything special for us here from the 67 team when we go there uh to be completely honest with you I&amp;#39;ve only run that track like once or twice on iRacing so uh if I can finish top 10 I&amp;#39;ll probably consider it a good night well sounds like some practice in your near future Eric Tracy congratulations on the top three though I think this is the first time I&amp;#39;ve talked to you personally uh up in the broadcast Booth but congratulations on that anybody you want to shout out uh just uh all the guys at velocity um you know we have fun racing together uh the night was a little bit rough for most of them but uh good group and then uh Aaron and everybody that puts on the league and you guys for broadcasting it it&amp;#39;s uh it&amp;#39;s fun to race Eric Tracy top three finish started in the top three brings it home in the top three and homage to Rusty Wallace in that Miller High Life machine appreciate your time Eric all right thank you moving on down Pit Road we have another interview it&amp;#39;s uh Eric Tracy in the number well I apologize G Kender that I need to pull up here in the 13 car got a little bit confused there but nonetheless uh Garrett it&amp;#39;s another Podium day for the 13 car you got to feel good about this it&amp;#39;s going to help you in the points tremendously yeah yeah a good points day overall uh after a rough finish of the race you know I was in pretty good points position last week and got tied up in that that white flag dust up and and lost a bunch of points so uh glad to glad to get a decent finish out of it you know can&amp;#39;t can&amp;#39;t be mad about how that ended up at all well I want to go back I popped into the chat there briefly and and made mention of it but it was about 400 feet that you needed that last caution to come out a little bit sooner yeah I don&amp;#39;t know if if 400 feet sooner would have been great or about 500 feet later uh you know I would had a run on the high side and be been able to sneak back in front but you know I I can&amp;#39;t complain about it one way or the other that&amp;#39;s the same way I got the lead from Eddie so you know I I snuck down on him and uh just nose in front of him for the lead so you know turnouts fair play you know he raced me clean there was plenty of chances where he could have got into me me into a turn so you know I&amp;#39;m all good with it now P2 for me on that race was um I had damage from a wreck early on that I nursed the whole race so I&amp;#39;m thrilled with it well these cars look like they were a handful here tonight from one of the shortest tracks that we race at on this schedule but Garrett ker congratulations on this podium in second place anybody come to mind you want to shout out before we let you go yeah of course want to thank Kinder farman Ranch ret speed shop thank my wonderful wife for letting me come and hang out with the boys on a Sunday night uh big fraking cross 5 catac coolers everybody over at vsrn uh man I I I&amp;#39;ll watch y&amp;#39; stuff even if I&amp;#39;m not racing it I I&amp;#39;ll still sometimes tune in and uh it&amp;#39;s always top grade quality so shout out to y&amp;#39;all uh Aaron over here at Apex Jimmy at Apex Sim racing gear for keeping the Lots on over here American grid apparel company uh man just just everybody makes this thing tick it&amp;#39;s a good time over here just looking forward to carry some momentum for the rest of the season yeah that&amp;#39;s another aspect keeping the lights on that seemed to be pretty tough this week for a lot of guys with the severe weather I hope nobody you knew was affected by that but it is that time of year so stay safe and we look forward to seeing you next week at Darlington all right sounds good brother here Kinder second place finisher here today and finally we bring up Victory Lane and uh you know it&amp;#39;s pretty awesome that they added the ability to drive into Victory Lane at this racetrack they had at Phoenix now they have it at Bristol I think they should add it to every single racetrack heads up move there Jesse to to know to be able to do that but a little under the weather last week and uh a little bit overall it was it was a rough race for you but you recover in this one and from the poll you get the victory hey yeah last week I mean I definitely was not feeling my best um I was actually feeling even worse the next night but I mean it is what it is is but I made some mistakes I will hopped and slid into uh Charles and uh and then just missed my breaking point cuz I cut the dog leg which I hadn&amp;#39;t been doing all night and I mean I feel horrible but none of it was intentional it wasn&amp;#39;t trying to be dumb or anything but to be able to come back out tonight feeling 100% and uh going out grabbing the pole and faced a little bit of adversity but like it didn&amp;#39;t come definitely didn&amp;#39;t come without challenges but I just decided to come down Pit Road with about 75 laps to go and I was like you know if if uh Eddie&amp;#39;s been able to hold on this long if I can get back up here then you know I I&amp;#39;ll be able to hold on so I knew the speed was there it was just about capitalizing and doing what I could and hey it all worked out I&amp;#39;m just happy to be in the playoffs and uh looking forward to how the rest of the season can go after this we talk about about some of the tracks that are tough to get around we have Darlington next week it&amp;#39;s another track that I&amp;#39;ve seen you perform on but it it is one of those asterisks in the schedule where it&amp;#39;s Unique and and it&amp;#39;s not a place that you can race like that anywhere else what do we have in store for the 94 next week uh hopefully we can come out there and and put on another show the Darlington is by far one of my uh favorite tracks um mainly because you have to race the track not the other cars around you and um the tracks where you have to um sit back take care of your stuff and really be mindful through the race that&amp;#39;s uh th those are the kind of races that I look forward to like Darlington a lot of people are going to hate it that&amp;#39;s one that I have circled so uh to be able to go into one of my favorite tracks and um see how we can do there um already locked in that&amp;#39;s uh that&amp;#39;s definitely going to boost the confidence going into the race next week so I&amp;#39;m looking forward to it I don&amp;#39;t know if everybody else is but I am well I can tell you this it&amp;#39;s a it&amp;#39;s a good day at Darlington if you don&amp;#39;t add any paint to the wall so good luck on that Jesse we appreciate your time coming up here in the broadcast Booth we also appreciate giving that cinematic approach to Victory Lane is there anybody you want to shout out though before we let you go oh absolutely um first and foremost I got to thank my wife my kids um they they&amp;#39;re always encouraging actually I was streaming tonight so I had my wife in the twitch chat encouraging me making fun of me a little bit for my faces that I make throughout the race and stuff like that so uh got to thank them never never complaining about me coming out here and doing this just having a good time and uh and pushing me to do better and um of course I got to throw a shout out to the the sponsor that&amp;#39;s on my car this week nubwo um it&amp;#39;s a pretty cheap headset it&amp;#39;s actually what I&amp;#39;m wearing right here um fairly cheap on Amazon uh but you get like 100 hours of game time on a three or four hour charge that&amp;#39;s good in my book um

will the plank at the radiator round at the radiator round Come On Son let&amp;#39;s have some fun at the radiator sing it James the radi theator arms you pick the one of us that can&amp;#39;t sing I need to warm up my voice your voice even on a frozen December day is hotter than mine in the middle of July I assure you there is a reason I have chosen the spoken word as my medium and not singing but I&amp;#39;m in a good mood Gentlemen We had a great recording session earlier today and I feel like celebrating which I&amp;#39;m going to do with the medium of schur this is the last bottle sent To Us by the good people atler and this is a fancy one this is pink bubbly uh they didn&amp;#39;t give us any money or anything like that I was just exceptionally cheeky and emailed them and said uh we&amp;#39;re doing a podcast uh we&amp;#39;re going to talk about cars um we don&amp;#39;t really drink we certainly don&amp;#39;t drink and drive um can you send us some stuff and they did which is which is very very nice of them so I&amp;#39;m going to try and pop this cork off try not to break the studio and then we&amp;#39;ll uh we&amp;#39;ll have a little drink talk among yourselves all right well we&amp;#39;re going to have a little bit of ASMR popping right now oh oh Mercedes did you see um the guy is it John cand I think it&amp;#39;s pronounced he um he got his wife uh to do it and she got dressed up as well but they did it with their proton and shout out to my good buddy Lori who did it with his Dennis fire engine Fant you got going Mercedes and then him going Dennis and here we go hey all right glasses gentlemen I I do have to say James with your singing after I saw you um on the Andor trip in the sco you were singing Duran Duran&amp;#39;s Rio on the way there I thought it was very tuneful you did all right to be honest as they say I hit all the right notes just not necessarily in the right order it&amp;#39;s like jazz that H well I thank you also to not just my compatriots here to my left ant AKA ant from Sports and touring and of course jam and friends and the Man in the can the Maestro with a maestro it will thank you gentlemen cheers dear cheers looking very sophisticated with your wine glass ant I must say yeah wait wait wait I&amp;#39;m going to just extend my little finger there we go now I&amp;#39;m doing it properly oh it&amp;#39;s yeah it&amp;#39;s got It&amp;#39;s light it&amp;#39;s crispy it&amp;#39;s not got that pimsy Vibe of the last one that we had no it&amp;#39;s got an air of hopefully a full-on paid sponsorship to it I thought you were about to say an era full on Hope wow um speaking of which a downstairs gentleman I have in those other boxes you saw some merchandise potential samples o yeah I was wondering what that was mhm so if anybody is interested in getting their hands on some extraordinarily limited edition radiator arms merch send me an email it&amp;#39;ll be in the description somewhere down below uh if it isn&amp;#39;t it&amp;#39;s talk jm.com uh we won&amp;#39;t be making many of these things it&amp;#39;s going to be a really really small run to celebrate the launch of this new Venture uh but yeah if you&amp;#39;re interested uh do drop us a line anyway I think it&amp;#39;s worth mentioning we&amp;#39;ve got a new mic stand as well because some people were complaining that the other mic stand coming across here was hiding my face uh and most people were saying that that&amp;#39;s a problem rather than please can you keep that microphone in front of his face so uh now I&amp;#39;m expecting the comments to start complaining about I preferred it when the microphone covered his face couldn&amp;#39;t see his face yeah um did you ever see my review of the fat multipler in which a gentleman has a bag with eye holes cut out for his wife to wear when they&amp;#39;re driving to events I I think I may have seen that uh but yes are we going to do a similar thing for an he actually turned up to one of my quizzes the other night and um it was a Valentine&amp;#39;s Day thing and uh as part of like I gave out some random prizes and one of them was going to be for like the most sickeningly in love couple and another was for which I gave to the only couple in the room that was engaged who are by default the most sicken inly in love couple in the room but I also had a spare like petrol station fake Rose to give to the man what messed up most for Valentine&amp;#39;s Day which had been the day before and I wind up giving it to him because it turns out he&amp;#39;s bought us some jewelry he&amp;#39;s bought us some rings but with no attached commitment yeah so um so I I gave him the rose to give to her just you know as a bit of a sympathy thing uh anyway cars when did they stop getting better 2018 thank you very much for joining us on the radiator arms uh as ever you can listen to us on Apple music Amazon spot ify and it&amp;#39;ll always be here First on YouTube goodbye at the radio no no no uh yeah so I&amp;#39;m I&amp;#39;ve got 2018 but we&amp;#39;ve got to arrive there first and so gentlemen your suggestions please 2001 o an any advance well my most recent car is a 2014 car and I quite like it actually you know my most recent car is a 2018 car but that was designed in 2009 so is that the Zed yeah yeah so I&amp;#39;m going to say was it 2009 for 370 came out 2009 yeah wow yeah when did the 350 come out 2003 blind me I now the 350 does look like a 20 odd year old car to me but the 370 does not no especially with the Nismo kit on it still looks very current I mean the the tail lights not as current but that&amp;#39;s one of the few things left about the car that doesn&amp;#39;t look like a current car and actually that car was very cool because it was the first car that the manual had the auto sync rev matching yeah the auto blip yeah but I would say I would say there&amp;#39;s for the majority of cars probably around 2010 to 2015 okay all right okay so we&amp;#39;re all in the 2000s will show your workings right okay so so maybe not quite 2001 but um when was it uh the E60 BMW and the Seven series of a similar vintage came out so the e65 7 Series you&amp;#39;re thinking of came out in I believe 2001 okay so I drove an E38 today so this information is fairly fresh in my mind yes that came out in 2001 but I think it&amp;#39;s actually aged quite well the e65 ser series would have come out a little later I want to say 2004 five cuz I&amp;#39;m thinking when was the last E46 M3s it&amp;#39;s about 2004 I think it&amp;#39;s about 20034 something along that time now the reason I say this is because that is the era of a lot of Manufacturers starting to put uh integrated multimedia systems into their cars which were rubbish um so you got to think of the BMW iDrive is one of them those early iDrive systems haven&amp;#39;t aged very well in my opinion um because you can&amp;#39;t really do a lot with them when it comes to the aftermarket they&amp;#39;re so integral you can so this is really interesting about six seven years ago maybe there was this whole generation of cars like the E90 M3 for example that I I really liked but I was sort of not keen on buying because they have this integrated infotainment system you can&amp;#39;t easily replace it and if you did you&amp;#39;d lose half the functions of the car but now there are aftermarket Android auto and apple carplay solutions for that era of car so now you can you get your screen and it looks like it&amp;#39;s a normal ordinary iDrive screen my buddy Chris has got this on his I3 so it&amp;#39;s similar sort of era you hold down a button and all of a sudden you&amp;#39;ve got your Android auto and apple carplay running behind the scenes and it works pretty well y same thing on actually the Zeds as well um there&amp;#39;s a couple of different manufacturers that make them I think they&amp;#39;re actually the same things just rebranded um but yeah and it works just as any kind of infotainment system would work um has Apple carplay Android auto one of the other cool things is that there&amp;#39;s also replacement capacitive tou touch screen that you can put into the car cuz it had a resistive touchcreen put a capacitive one in so it feels a little bit more you know better and it&amp;#39;s a nice glossy screen so there are cars where these are being replaced with now also there&amp;#39;s even one for the Z the the 370 specifically where you can replace the entire center console with a giant tablet if you want toen integrated it&amp;#39;s integrated yeah my thing with those is a lot of them are based on cheap Chinese tat that is is the other issue so they&amp;#39;re actually going to be pretty poor I&amp;#39;ve experienced a few of them because um I think I&amp;#39;ve said before back in the day I used to work for Halfords I used to be their car audio installer guy I&amp;#39;ve probably done about four five maybe 600 radios and my issue was always with cars where if you wanted to replace a normal single D head unit with something else you could do that but you would lose your miles per gallon you would lose your clocks uh you would lose uh outside temperature things like that cuz a lot of them are done over like fiber optic or bus connections if you remove that link uh then it stops working you know as I said um the why I liked kind of the last series of the E39 E38 and stuff like that is you generally didn&amp;#39;t tend to lose what was on your main screen in the instrument cluster miles began stuff because even if you had the highend um or even the 4x3 as it was back in 1997 that my dad had in his uh r845 U BMW 535i with the full DSP system may I add and everything which I ended up gutting out the car I ripped it all out so all of it was gone and we still kept the miles Gall in the center console and we didn&amp;#39;t have to worry about changing the clock on the center console it could still all be done via the uh the actual dashboard see I got to give Porsche some real credit here because Porsche have been developing over the last few years a series of they call them uh classic communication systems so the first one they did was just a single D setup with a little color screen In fairness it&amp;#39;s not very good because in sunlight you can&amp;#39;t read it but that slots into the single Den that you get in Old 911s like up to 964 993 and it&amp;#39;s styled that it looks kind of appropriate but they now also do systems for the 986 996 so the first generation of boxer the old 911 and then like 987 so like the Cayman I have a 997 like today I&amp;#39;ve come here in my buddy Chris&amp;#39;s 987 Boxster they now do official Double D full color screen systems that just slot in look like they&amp;#39;ve always been there but have Android auto Apple carplay all the modern functionality it&amp;#39;s not cheap sure I think it&amp;#39;s like two grand once it&amp;#39;s fitted and everything else but it works so much better and looks so much neater than a lot of these systems and that&amp;#39;s the reason I tend to not like them is because they just they look wrong most of them the 550 I&amp;#39;m so upset it&amp;#39;s got a correct Ferrari Becca head unit in it but it would have actually been an upgrade that they sold later cuz it&amp;#39;s got satav It&amp;#39;s got old text based satnav that works right from like 22 years ago so it&amp;#39;s what would have been an option in an F430 and you could then get it the original Sony head unit you basically can&amp;#39;t get them for love no money there&amp;#39;s one on eBay I think and it&amp;#39;s like 3,000 quids somebody wants for it and I&amp;#39;m not paying that if we&amp;#39;re talking about Entertainment Systems what was the manufacturer that H I think rimat might be one of the companies that did it but there was another company was it Kia or Hyundai that came up with uh system where you just install an app on your phone and there&amp;#39;s a place to put your phone and that becomes the entertainment system for the true of doing that I know yeah and the VW up also was actually quite smart because you basically had a a cradle for your phone was effectively yeah your your uh nav and everything else cuz they knew whatever they were going to put in that car at that price point wasn&amp;#39;t going to be as good as your phone I can one up with some weirdness from that please do you remember um I don&amp;#39;t know if the upset is all about say for a while uh they had on their dashboards uh place to put a Garmin satnav which would click into the top now I I&amp;#39;ve had experience with this because my uh father-in-law&amp;#39;s car which I helped him cell had that um and it was weird if you wanted to have Bluetooth handsfree and uh any form of Bluetooth music streaming you had to have this satav attached to it that did you&amp;#39;re correct my other half of the time had one in her say IA yeah they&amp;#39;re so weird they were not good satav units either in my opinion no they were just and now you have to have to have that without removing the factory radio you have to have some ugly old Garmin satnav on display all the time which people may steal but the most annoying thing I found with is if you actually take the satnav out and put it back in sometimes the connectors wouldn&amp;#39;t always up and they do weird things and you had to basically always leave it in there like a cartridge you have to blow on it and kind of get it back see now now I actually with my DBS so my DB9 there&amp;#39;s a company that does retrofit Android auto Apple carplay in the little fold up nav screen you get an ason of that era and it kind of works but it is based on these Chinese electronics that are a bit iffy and sometimes it just crashes and there&amp;#39;s no way to reset it other than to basically turn the car off for half an hour which if you&amp;#39;re on the motorway trying to get some quite frustrating with the D DBS I decided to go a different route I erased the whole thing completely because the DBS already had in the glove box or in the center console sorry a little adapter for Bluetooth so it plugged into the old iPod connector remember those the big wide One MH and it fooled the car into thinking an iPod was plugged in now in that generation of Aston you get this little sort of like you know three or four row LCD display that controls all of the infotainment all the sort of entertainment functions so the nav and so if you got a phone plugged in you can even Skip and reverse tracks as well and basically what I did was found a company that could make a a dashboard that had no nav in it so I got rid of it I uh I have that in the Lamborghini and in the R8 yeah those adapters they&amp;#39;re very cool I used to have something even that predated iPods I had a Sony uh head unit single de one which had a mini dis player in it yeah which used to be in my dad&amp;#39;s old Mercedes 300E um so this is like late 90s early 2000s and it had a CD changer as well uh the CD changer ended up dying um so I but I still wanted to use that radio and this was around the time I&amp;#39;d actually started past my test back 2013 uh so I got an adapter which was specific to those units from a company called connect 2 which allowed me to turn into an auxiliary in and I did that and I hooked it up to a parot Bluetooth handsfree kit which then also gave it Bluetooth audio stream streaming and all of a sudden my lovely old minis Sony radio which has been working great for years work with Bluetooth music streaming yep so uh one of the things that you may see on the JM and Friends Channel this year is Will and I are looking with a mutual friend of ours well really a friend of Wills to upgrade to the stereo in the Celica which is mostly absent and I have treated myself to a 25-year-old period correct Pioneer mini disc unit nice yeah cuz you know 199 in Japan mini dis head unit that was the bees knes I have a mini dis player by my feet which you keep eyeing up and wanting to steal I am one day it&amp;#39;s going to be gone and I will have a rock solid Alibi and know you won&amp;#39;t be able to check my garage for it here you go you can hold a mini disc if you like oh thanks babe oh yeah I miss these things so much actually a subscriber did send me a whole bunch of their like you know homemade mini disc albums and there are some crackers in there I love a mix tape yeah or mix disc I&amp;#39;ll gets too nostalgic I&amp;#39;ll start crying and I&amp;#39;ll ruin your microphone okay so infotainment all right that&amp;#39;s one part of it what else so it is when Bings and bongs started becoming a big thing so when the car would shout at you for stuff not like things you can understand like low coolant warning um or you know like washer fluid or the do open or the do&amp;#39;s open just just when it started binging and bonging for everything uh like I think and I know it&amp;#39;s safety wise but and it&amp;#39;s and it&amp;#39;s good to have it but if you put something on your your rear seat or your passenger seat and the car is screaming at you that the seat belt is is not on because it thinks a human is there no I&amp;#39;ve just put an old CRT television on my rear seats there&amp;#39;s not a human there I don&amp;#39;t want to have to do it and I also don&amp;#39;t want you to get louder as I drive away I used to hate my six series for that because I thought it was always fat shaming me because I put my Takeaway on the passenger seit and it would just bong at me but sometimes it wouldn&amp;#39;t so I was like oh right oh the extra PR crackers that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s it is that&amp;#39;s what it is okay like yeah the worst car I think I ever drove for that was uh Scott ratarossa had an American spec Ferrari f355 and a lot of the things that we see these days have come over from the state yeah and companies like Ferrari in particular they don&amp;#39;t really do region specific stuff so a lot of the warnings and things in say like the F12 they&amp;#39;re because it&amp;#39;s mandated in the USA you know like please do not operate this machine while you&amp;#39;re drunken on fire you know that sort of silly stuff just in case you you kind of didn&amp;#39;t realize that that&amp;#39;s not the way to operate heavy machinery um so the the f355 it beeps when you unlock it it beeps when you do the immobilizer uh it beeps if you haven&amp;#39;t got your seat belt on uh it&amp;#39;ll beep if the doors open then it&amp;#39;ll beep if you put it in reverse even though it doesn&amp;#39;t have reversing sensors it just beeps to remind you that it is in Reverse uh and then if you&amp;#39;re sat at a junction for more than a minute it&amp;#39;ll take itself out of gear and then it&amp;#39;ll beep to tell you that it&amp;#39;s out of gear very very frustrating also like the minute you say like beeps and bongs I can hear the E90 generation BMW chime like it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s in my head I can&amp;#39;t get rid of it that&amp;#39;s why we replaced my dad&amp;#39;s Chimes on his Five series with Rolls-Royce ones oh yeah we programmed that in and it&amp;#39;s uh so when it tells him every time he starts C that the air suspension isn&amp;#39;t working because we removed it and replace it with springs it&amp;#39;s much more pleasant ding instead of yeah excuse me sir are you aware exactly I do say so you have a slight fault with your car please do get your butler to drive it to the nearest service center much better than your old talking Maestro dashboards air suspension warning exactly all right any further cases for the prosecution any further cases oh I you know what what is the newest car you&amp;#39;ve ever driven um my wife&amp;#39;s 2020 5 or 2024 uh Renault clear Rena clear and that COA born thing Oba all right what&amp;#39;s the oldest car you&amp;#39;ve ever driven 1965 Morris Miner oo nice that&amp;#39;s a that&amp;#39;s a good spread good spread yes so with my wife&amp;#39;s car um I think the annoyances are are on there like what&amp;#39;s like with a lot of what Lane keep assist yeah it&amp;#39;s very annoying I&amp;#39;m very thankful though on hers unlike a lot of the other ones it stays off when you press the button yeah now I had a Renault ustal e whatever the heck it&amp;#39;s called at press car and I noticed that as well which I was very surprised about because it is a legal requirement that those systems turn themselves back on every time you start the car but Renault seemed to have done a bit of a TVR and just I think not got that memos and I&amp;#39;m quite happy with that to be honest um because I tell you where I think some of these systems I don&amp;#39;t know about you I feel like they have a time and a place I feel like on the Dual carriageways or on the motorways you know if you&amp;#39;re perhaps a little bit more tired at night over dinner we were talking about you know the Perils of driving tired and um some of these little things like my wife she just 25,000 miles a year I&amp;#39;m very I&amp;#39;m very glad that her car has all these features but if they were on all the time you know just driving around the city go go mad country lanes even oh absolutely I mean I I I tried it I went to Cambridge not too long ago and I used some of the the the systems on the way back it&amp;#39;s kind of nice adaptive cruise control that was great I liked that and having the uh the heated steering wheel as well that was very nice and having the lane Keepers was just nice I said lovely and nud you back in but if you&amp;#39;re going around town trying to merge something like that and it&amp;#39;s TR just doesn&amp;#39;t know or or even you&amp;#39;re going down a Country Lane and you can see a giant pothole on the left and you think you know what I&amp;#39;m just going to straddle the broken White lines in order to not destroy my allo and it starts fighting you trying to get you back yeah uh the town that uh both will and I drive through all the time like a lot of towns in Britain there are sections of it where people park on the road so it&amp;#39;s effectively reduced to one lane and in many modern cars we&amp;#39;ll be driving up to the cars that are parked we can see well beyond them we know that the way is clear but then before you&amp;#39;ve had a chance to indicate and you know tell other red users what you may or may not be doing the car has suddenly panicked and slammed on the brakes because it thinks you&amp;#39;re about to crash which can in certain cases almost cause or actually cause another crash oh my God I hate that automated braking system it is just no good sometimes in in my mom&amp;#39;s sandera and my wife&amp;#39;s Cleo I know they&amp;#39;re both Renault products but it&amp;#39;ll just Flash and Go at you and then it&amp;#39;s done nothing you&amp;#39;re like why is the screen just gone R you&amp;#39;re like oh it thought it saw a car but no it was a leaf a friend of mine uh he went straight into the back of a Tesla for exactly that reason the car just slammed on its brakes he was cycling and he went straight into the back of it wow see these Safety Systems they&amp;#39;re dangerous they are I tell you what one of the worst systems is and I don&amp;#39;t know if anybody has ever experienced a car they actually work correctly and that is rain sensing wipers they have a mind of their own some are better than others though every Tesla owner I know it&amp;#39;s one of their bug bears that the Tesla software all is all based on cameras yes and it&amp;#39;s well known that Tesla&amp;#39;s Auto wipers just don&amp;#39;t really work very well every other manufacturer worked out 30 years ago how to get rain sensing wipers to work and work reasonably reliably Tesla the week I had one you&amp;#39;d be driving through a thunderstorm nothing in the middle of town with maybe a gentle bit of drizzle like thing was going like crazy but yeah okay also here&amp;#39;s another thing um you cannot actually turn the lights off totally on my mom sandera and I think my wife&amp;#39;s clear either they can&amp;#39;t be turned off so it&amp;#39;s either Auto or on I got stuck with my iora a couple of times because the daylight running lights were so bright I didn&amp;#39;t realize I hadn&amp;#39;t turned the lights on yeah that&amp;#39;s a commonplace thing I don&amp;#39;t know how often you guys see that people driving around at night with just their just their daytime running lights on they&amp;#39;ve got no lights at the back nobody can see you y I wonder if it&amp;#39;s they just don&amp;#39;t notice because the drls are so bright these days also back in the day you know I was uh out moving the Celica around earlier and it&amp;#39;s pretty clear at night in the Celica when the lights aren&amp;#39;t on a because I can&amp;#39;t see out the front but B because the dash isn&amp;#39;t illuminated in fact uh in the boxer that I&amp;#39;ve been driving on recently the only way to really tell if the lights are on or not is to either look at The Rotary selector for the lights or the dash if the dash is lit up the lights are on if you can&amp;#39;t see it means the lights on on but modern stuff has digital dashes that are permanently illuminated all the time anyway so and what&amp;#39;s the oldest car you&amp;#39;ve driven ah we were talking about it earlier I think it was a 1953 Bristol oh yeah uh not the 411 um 45 or 404 44 4 gorgeous car oh I love that car that was nice that was really really nice yeah and actually I fell in love with it because it was just so simple it was raw but I don&amp;#39;t know it had trafficators yeah super engaging uh trafficators are the little flaps out the side the sort of preate indicators yeah so there was no flashing indicator lights and uh but I love that car I I mean you remember the look on my face that day when I came back I was like I didn&amp;#39;t want to give this car back it was so so good but yeah and and I think you know when we were talking in that video I think it was only then that I really thought maybe this is what I&amp;#39;ve been looking for in modern cars cuz I always say oh I like the suspension to be a bit stiffer and I like it to be a bit harder to drive and I like the engagement of all of those things maybe deep down I actually want a classic car I think you should get one classic car ownership is great especially if you&amp;#39;ve got a little bit of mechanical knowledge as well and you like to Tinker you don&amp;#39;t have to Tinker if you own a classic let&amp;#39;s make this very straight uh there are people and garages locally that will look after your cars for you but if you know how to you know fiddle with a distributed cap a condenser points and and bits and bobs at the side of the road it does help but you obviously it&amp;#39;s like anything are you are you willing to potentially break down one day for no reason whatsoever I could totally see you in like a 240 Zed oh M that&amp;#39;s that is on my list okay look two cars that are on my list I&amp;#39;ve never driven and I desperately need to to make sure that I&amp;#39;m not dreaming about something I was going to hate but I think I would love it two cars that I absolutely want 240 Z yep and in particular I really want to get an MZ are built 240Z mhm their cars are incredible and there&amp;#39;s one that they did I think it was like a one-off with these extra sort of wider wheel arches like period correct stick on but modernized Resto model looking um and yeah their Interiors are stunning the other car and I was talking with Jack from number 27 about this oh yeah I know what it is detto Masa panta GT5 specifically the big fat archers yes I know somebody has one of those and I&amp;#39;ve seen it in person is a it&amp;#39;s a very very lovely car you introduce us please uh that car is a narrow body one uh the GT5 is actually quite a rare thing they they&amp;#39;re very very cool but yeah one one day we got to get try and get behind the wheel of like a like a classic Ferrari you would love I mean like with a passion the cach that I drove oh yeah because after an hour it&amp;#39;s one of those cars where it was Ruddy loud that it was only when I got out of it that I realized how physical it was I mean I was so excited because look I I never idolized the cach right I never loved the cach I never thought it was the prettiest looking car I was a Diablo guy right I was Diablo Need for Speed special edition right we talked about this before I&amp;#39;m all about the Diablo but someone offers you a girl of a kunash you don&amp;#39;t say no thank you very much I&amp;#39;m not that into it right I know YouTubers out there that say no to car cuz they don&amp;#39;t interest them I&amp;#39;m like the best bit about the job is driving cars that don&amp;#39;t interest me cuz sometimes you get to experience stuff and go I&amp;#39;ve been missing out this Countach I I got out of it after an hour and you could rung me out like it was unbeliev I could barely hear cuz it had a sports exhaust that is very much like no exhaust Sports yes sports right it was it was it was intensive I mean I think I was also a bit like nervous about the whole thing because just half a million pound car right um but it was just like being on the front row of a rock concert like I got out and I was like if you told me to drive to Scotland in it I just say no no thank you but for an hour what an hour y see this is this is the thing that I like um I mean but then I&amp;#39;m also a bit of a automotive masochist where you really are I would drive to Scotland in it yeah you would um but yeah so ah cars that so I think I think there was probably a period where cars dipped came back and then now cars aren&amp;#39;t really cars to me anymore they&amp;#39;re more like appliances that transport people from A to B even and I even they&amp;#39;re too good this is the problem the cars are actually just too good now there&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s so much that they do for you that it takes away from some of that experience and the solution to that with a lot of these cars particularly if they&amp;#39;re hybrids or electric is we&amp;#39;ll just throw more horsepower at it you know if we can&amp;#39;t keep you engaged with noise because there isn&amp;#39;t any say in an EV or if we can&amp;#39;t keep you engaged because now there&amp;#39;s no gears to change or whatever we&amp;#39;ll just make it ridiculously fast to the point where you know it&amp;#39;ll snap your neck for until you get to 60 M an hour and then run out of puff manufacturers do forget that some of the the best fun you can have is driving a slow car fast oh yes something that is on the bleeding edge at 20 mph has got a lot of grin factor to it what was that car with the fake gear shifts hyi ionic 5n yes I&amp;#39;m trying to get one I actually I don&amp;#39;t hate the idea about that I&amp;#39;ve thought about it a lot um and I guess if you can have something to help you interact a little bit get a bit more enjoyment out of your EV then you you could you could do worse than than something that simulates you know the feel of of a real car some people out there might want to shoot me for this opinion but I don&amp;#39;t know i&amp;#39; I&amp;#39;d like to see what that&amp;#39;s like because I imagine it&amp;#39;s from what I&amp;#39;ve read a lot of people even real you know people who love cars and love internal combustion have actually Come Away with quite the smile on their face I think that&amp;#39;s the most important thing if you get out of a car and you&amp;#39;re still smiling and having fun then surely that&amp;#39;s a good car I like what Rich builds did in the US he ripped out all of the electrics from Tesla and put a V8 in it instead yes yes Rich rebuild it I saw that that ice tea that&amp;#39;s what you called it wasn&amp;#39;t it what a name fantastic see I think particularly when it comes to EVS there are a lot of people who&amp;#39;ve simply decided that they don&amp;#39;t like them and that they&amp;#39;re all the same and they&amp;#39;ve just stuck their head in the Sands like no no no no no never shall I ever entertain this and I&amp;#39;m like I do feel a bit sorry for those people because I think there are some genuinely good cards out there and hopefully there will be some genuinely great cars out there that happen to be EVS I like the idea of the a290 the a290 also that hyundi concept 74 that they God which they are apparently making £350,000 apparently I&amp;#39;m really excited for all the the little EVS from like Rena that are coming out and stuff like that like you got the four obviously you got the five the da of spring that&amp;#39;s coming up I I don&amp;#39;t know why but I really like the sound of that it&amp;#39;s just CU it seems like it&amp;#39;s a back to basic car um which seems to have a bit of character and a bit of crap quirkiness about it uh that just happens to be electric yeah also rear engine rear wheeel drive is basically making a comeback yeah like who would have thought it like the EV is saving rear wheeel drive yeah it&amp;#39;s nuts and also you know there are lots of rules and rs and things around cars and EVS are now giving Freedom back to designers that they haven&amp;#39;t had for a very very long time cuz you know Maserati have already proven you can make a beautiful car that&amp;#39;s an EV though I do take issue with an article that I read I cannot remember the outlet which is shameful I know but it was talking about the mc20 and in it they said oh actually the steering in this is brilliant and actually um people that think hydraulic steering is the best in the world are wrong and electric steering can be better than hydraulic steering Ste ining because what it can do is filter out all the lumps and bumps and kickb backing things in hydraulic steering like no that&amp;#39;s the best part of hydraulic steering that&amp;#39;s the that&amp;#39;s the point because you&amp;#39;re like if you&amp;#39;re filtering out that information you&amp;#39;re like you need that information because that&amp;#39;s telling you what&amp;#39;s going on with the wheels and if it&amp;#39;s taken away from you you as a driver can no longer make decisions about the road surface you&amp;#39;re experiencing and in like a normal cooking let&amp;#39;s call it Reno 5 I don&amp;#39;t mind but we&amp;#39;re talking about a 300,000 660 h power Supercar that should be built for people that want to drive like simple as that Al some I understand why a lot of Manufacturers have that uh electric steering now which is to help with the driver AIDS as well is one thing I think it reduces cost as well um cost complexity and it improves efficiency as well yes because you can have literally I think Fiat or some of the early ones I remember doing it in their punos and things like that having electric steering columns I&amp;#39;m pretty sure my Mazda 2 had one as well I had a 2008 Mazda 2 some of the old as well have like a city mode button yes yes my my wife&amp;#39;s F 500 uh had that and they&amp;#39;re not the most engaging things to drive but for the most part I think they&amp;#39;re actually not terrible because generally they tend to point where you&amp;#39;re going I that sounds silly but like you you don&amp;#39;t have to think too much with a lot of these cars about where you&amp;#39;re going and I&amp;#39;ve driven cars with electric power steering uh which are terrible I&amp;#39;m pretty sure the Corsa D um is electric if it&amp;#39;s not it is the worst hydraulic power steering I&amp;#39;ve ever heard I&amp;#39;ve ever felt what do you guys think of steer by wire cuz the Tesla cybertruck apparently has stby Wire yeah I&amp;#39;m not so keen on the concept partly because I&amp;#39;ve seen videos that show that there is a real disconnect between what you do and what it does but also because I think there are certain things where an increasing amount of technology is not a good thing and steering is one of them I actually would give maybe some consideration to an off-road vehicle like the Cyber truck theoretically having steer by wire because there are also scenarios particularly an off-road vehicle where a sudden turn could hurt you as a driver you know um and you know that&amp;#39;s why a lot of 44s have slow steering Rags because you don&amp;#39;t want if you&amp;#39;re a properly off-roading you do not want a hyper sensitive steering rack it&amp;#39;s a really bad thing and of course it gives you flexibility to have steering in that set up how you like I&amp;#39;ve experienced brake by wire and obviously we&amp;#39;ve most of us have experienced throttle by Wire breake by wire in certain cars is borderline lethal alfha Romeo Julia for example I nearly crashed one of those once because the brake by wire system failed and I was exiting a petrol station I was doing 5 mph and the thing packed up and I was pushing that pedal as hard as I could and it was like gently tugging on the hand breake which Julia was this uh this was actually a like a cooking Julia it was like a regular you know diesel um Julia wait does does the uh the C foler does that have do that doesn&amp;#39;t work very well either I mean it works I love that car that&amp;#39;s just made me really sad what was it about the braking I remember there was something you couldn&amp;#39;t stop with accuracy basically it&amp;#39;s as you&amp;#39;re approaching a junction you know any decent competent driver can generally stop a car where they want to stop it and the Julia consistently I wasn&amp;#39;t stopping where I wanted to but the thing is oh yeah inconsistent pressure that&amp;#39;s what it was wasn&amp;#39;t it yeah um and I drove something the other day oh it&amp;#39;s the it was the cpra it&amp;#39;s the ca as well was like this you&amp;#39;d you&amp;#39;d press the brake pedal a little bit and it would do exactly what you expected it to but then you&amp;#39;d press a bit more and the next sort of 2 cm of travel didn&amp;#39;t feel like they did anything which of course as a driver is really disconcerting yes I I drove that car as well because you you put me on the Press insurance kindly and I said to you this feels exactly like my van did when the master cylinder was failing which is where the the fluid is leaking back into itself it&amp;#39;s not losing the fluid but you have to keep putting more and more pressure than it is a disconcerting feeling to drive that mhm you know I can understand somewhat with electric vehicles where they&amp;#39;re using regenerative braking cuz they work yeah still a work in progress um I was so used to having the space now I don&amp;#39;t have it um anyway um for those listening I just tapped the mic stand which you might have realized from what it sounded like I lost my thread where was I you&amp;#39;re talking about brakes and things brakes and things yes uh they&amp;#39;ve got to manage the regenerative breaking with the calipers putting pressure and they have to try and provide you with the right amount of stopping power if you like even though the am the way in which they&amp;#39;re trying to that stopping power might change so the regenerative braking might actually get to the point where okay now we can&amp;#39;t do any more regenerative breaking so that that stops and then the calipers have to take over and they have to be able to do that transition mid right in the middle of breaking so I kind of understand that it can be a challenge but then it&amp;#39;s like well some cars I&amp;#39;ve had where you can very much feel that transition and I almost don&amp;#39;t mind it because you as a driver can then get used to like Okay so this amount of travel is the gen and then beyond that you feel the caliper engaging which of course as an EV driver is very wasteful you know because you want to try and use the regen as much as you can you know this where one pedal drive comes in because it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s basically trying to use the regen what annoys me with all of this is that almost a decade ago Honda got it right the Hond NSX the second gen car break by wire Flawless absolutely Sensational you would not know that that pedal is not directly connected to those brakes they just got it right done sorted so what is the reason for Break by wire is it literally just for the electronic AES is that it or is that to reduce complexity when they change between different leftand drive rightand drive markets things like that well I&amp;#39;m sure there&amp;#39;s somebody said in a boardroom meeting this is a good idea it can save us 50 cents on each vehicle and then you end up with a Julia which wants to kill you at a petrol station I expect there are a variety of different reasons likely they also enable different features to to happen you know possibly regeneration different things like that I&amp;#39;m sure different manufacturers have different reasons and I don&amp;#39;t mind it in concept it&amp;#39;s just if it&amp;#39;s executed well it&amp;#39;s fine now I want to go on the defense a little bit for slightly modern cars okay this is partly based on recent experience old cars lovely would not want to crash one ah very true 100% uh this is is one of the things where I love my older cars and I love my 23y old Volkswagen Golf it has the right technology for me for my daily driver however I think if I started a family if I had a child I&amp;#39;d look at that car and go nope you&amp;#39;re too old you don&amp;#39;t have enough airbags you don&amp;#39;t have enough side protection stuff you don&amp;#39;t have enough aids to keep me on the road on the straight and narrow when the child has woken me up at 4: in in the morning needing Fe feeding and I&amp;#39;ve had 4 hours sleep and I&amp;#39;ve still got to get to work and get into places that is where I can understand wanting to have a more modern safe car and I think that should be a consideration for anybody who loves old cars that maybe sometimes it&amp;#39;s good to have your older car as a second car and not your daily yeah I did have a very small argument with somebody in the comment section once when I did a smart car review and somebody basically said well how smart is this because you know this is you only get two people in and where was an original Mini you get four people in it to which I said yeah cool great now try and get an original Mini to pass any sort of modern crash or emissions RS it hasn&amp;#39;t got a hope in well much rather have a crash in a mini than a smart car like I would I wouldn&amp;#39;t Cy like you crash a mini it&amp;#39;s going to fold up like a packet of crisps an old Mini the original Mini yeah a lot of people don&amp;#39;t understand that car&amp;#39;s crumple for a reason it is to deflect the energy from you and into the vehicle and make it go around you so when somebody&amp;#39;s driving that old Volvo and they and and somebody sees it having a smash and say oh it&amp;#39;s only got a slight Bend to the grill therefore it&amp;#39;s safe no yeah do you remember there was like a thing I think it was like early SUVs and a lot of uh like the trucks uh you know well what do you mean pickup trucks there we go um where they were made so stiff that when they were doing the crash tests the uh the a pillar the thank you the a pillar and the uh uh door yeah frame yeah uh would separate in a way where the passenger or driver would be thrown forward their head would go through the Gap and then as it kind of came back it would then come back and close and chop their head off have you ever seen those videos no it was all Crush test dummies no real people&amp;#39;s heads were well that we&amp;#39;re aware of that did you see the test footage recently of the Cyber truck doing a crash test and it basically drives straight into a wall at like 30 mph and the rear axle buckles mhm because it just passes all of the shock straight through the car and anybody that thinks old cars are better because they&amp;#39;re made of old pig iron and modern cars are crap and rubbish and made out of lightweight stuff the nhtsa in the United States to celebrate like 50 years of advancement got I think it was a 1957 Chevy and then drove it in your classic overlap test into a I think it was a 2007 Chevy Malibu like the modern equivalent now in the modern car yeah it looked like a bit of a mess but you could open the door you could get out you&amp;#39;d feel very very secondhand but you&amp;#39;d be okay the old car the first thing that happens is the steering column goes through the middle of the driver the whole thing just buckles folds up like it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s horrific to watch it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s scary you know I want to find that now people foret it&amp;#39;s really easy to find people forget there was a time before collapsible steering columns and they were literally it was like you were looking death straight in the eye every time you got in the car this is why uh a lot of the old steering wheels only had two spokes cuz they would fold this is also why sabs have the key in the center console because they did a test and realized that the key in the uh steering column was a potential source of basically slicing open an artery your thigh in the event of an accident so they moved that because you think about it you got a piece of metal sticking out with however many other keys are stuck onto it so yeah that&amp;#39;s why sa started doing that cuz they thought about these things and you know I&amp;#39;m very happy to say we live in a world where safety is a is a focus but on the flip side of that I don&amp;#39;t like that there is now an increasing uh you know interest or requirement towards some of these active Safety Systems and nowadays to get the full year end cap rating and everything a car has to have all of these Electro gizmos and I think that have been unfair because there are lots and lots of cars out there that would be just as safe in the event of a crash it&amp;#39;s just that somebody&amp;#39;s decided that having all this electrickery which makes cars more expensive more complicated and everything else is better and look I drive a lot of cars all the time and there are certain things I almost feel stupid for talking about when I&amp;#39;m driving certain cars and in modern cars do you know what it is massive B pillar right by my head so when I go and do what a motorcyclist would call their Lifesaver which we call for a reason right I can&amp;#39;t see like there&amp;#39;s huge blind spots in modern cars okay part of this is because if you get in an accident they are going to be safer but I also feel like sometimes they make the chance of that accident a lot higher when you drove my golf um you had uh went through a town near here and you you fil to left yeah yeah you filled to left and you said to me bloody hell I looked over my shoulder and I was amazed how much I could see and I&amp;#39;m like brilliant it is all glass in there but you know it is the risk is it&amp;#39;s still I think still a fairly strong car it was a it was a well regarded car back when it came out but you can tell that time and technology has moved on and it wouldn&amp;#39;t do as well as saying in fact my mom&amp;#39;s data sandero is a onear crash tested car because it doesn&amp;#39;t have all of these extra driver AIDS but I bet you it would still do better in an accident than my golf it possibly would yeah yeah all very similar and that golf was a four or five star car back in the day yeah so do you know what uh I think it would be good if they just added more stars because you know like Grand Theft Auto well just they need to be adding more stars because you know people might think that a you know five star rating today is the same as a five star rating from however many years ago and the regulations are always moving forward aren&amp;#39;t they so so like you know you you could be buying a car now thinking oh well it&amp;#39;s no safer than a car from 5 years ago but if it&amp;#39;s got all of these extra driver AIDS they should count for more stars yeah we should be up to at least 10 Stars by now surely there are cars I think the Renault Zoe might have been one of them where the regs changed and it lost a star it didn&amp;#39;t get any less safe that car at all it&amp;#39;s just they changed the way that they did the ratings the car didn&amp;#39;t have the systems that they deemed necessary and okay right I&amp;#39;m going to do my pitch now for this I need a top of AOW we&amp;#39;re getting to the bottom of bottle anyone else wants a more I&amp;#39;m still pretty good at pretty take take a bit all right so you yeah all right so thank you lovely people at schur mhm right I did not choose 2018 as an arbitrary date right as petrol heads I guys right we like we can all agree that cars getting safer is a good thing 100% yeah I loathe I mean actively with a passion loathe people that think old cars should be dangerous and that that is somehow a good thing it boggles my mind that people somehow think something being more dangerous than it should be is somehow to be celebrated guarantee you someone&amp;#39;s already put that in the comments correct it&amp;#39;s the the same people loved F1 when people died every week Group B rally when everybody nearly died as well yeah right okay so you know and look we all love Motorsport and things because there is an element of risk but nobody should die for our entertainment there&amp;#39;s a really good documentary about Formula 1 called one life on the limit and it&amp;#39;s a bit underrated what it actually looks at is the transition of Formula 1 from from being something that everybody knew about to something that was broadcast into the homes and it talks about the importance of safety in cars and how particularly through the 80s and 90s and naughties Formula 1 safety really improved and they did things like bringing Sid Watkins to to Circuit you know doing the stuff that we now take for granted you know having the ambulances following the cars around on the first lap making the tracks themselves safe there&amp;#39;s lots of great pictures of of you know mechanics from the teams going and fixing the armaco at circuits because they hadn&amp;#39;t bolted it in you know there&amp;#39;s loads of accidents that happened back in the day with really disastrous consequences that didn&amp;#39;t need to happen just because people&amp;#39;s attitudes to safety was rubbish Jackie Stewart famously drove with a spanner attached to the wheel of his car because he once got trapped in his car sitting in a bath of petrol and he couldn&amp;#39;t get out cuz again at the time they didn&amp;#39;t have you an easily removable steering wheel so that&amp;#39;s why he kept a spanner so he could get his steering wheel off if he needed it to you know you and Jackie Stewart himself deserves celebrating because he was one of the people that was brave enough and it seems stupid by modern Sanders brave enough to say why are we dying for this and people just said to him you know well if you can&amp;#39;t stand on the fire get out of the kitchen what what a moronic response anyway so I think safety is a very good thing but I think nuisance safety that is as likely to cause distraction for the driver I remember making a comment about my dad&amp;#39;s CLA for 45 which was one of the early cars to have this there was a light kept appearing in it and I could never work out what it was cuz by the time I went to look at it it had gone off and eventually I tweaked it was the light to tell you you were getting too close to the car in front and I thought someone somewhere has sat down and said Lads I&amp;#39;ve got a great idea for how to make this car safer what&amp;#39;s that Ben right when you get in a little bit too close to the car in front and you think an accident might be about to happen illuminate a light on the dash to distract the driver so they look down they don&amp;#39;t notice when they slammed on their brakes yeah right so um oh I must also make a correction by the way because I told my mother last night that I shared the story of her driving my dad&amp;#39;s Jaguar into the house um because she got distracted by the parking sensors uh correction she got distracted by my sister so um yes I just thought that&amp;#39;s important because otherwise you know Mom will probably never forgive me um but like you said some of of the Safety Systems I like some of these Safety Systems I don&amp;#39;t and I would like to be able to customize them to my preferences like an individual drive mode except it is legally required now that these systems turn themselves all on more than that by the way did you know it is a legal requirement that they are difficult to turn off it should require at least two button presses to disable these systems really that is part of the RS that&amp;#39;s why they&amp;#39;re all buried in menus and not easily accessible this came in in 2018 right we all have a nice fruity exhaust yeah we all have a good sounding decent car 2018 noise EGS changed so cars used to sound incredible stuff like the F12 812 458 488 sounded amazing then post 2018 opfs came in and not only opfs but also the noise limit itself also changed y Now cars sporty cars just don&amp;#39;t sound great that was 2018 do you know that&amp;#39;s a really good point um one of the reasons why the Nissan GTR the R35 was pulled from the market was based on noise y it was from did you know this whe it was from the tires were too loud yep tires were too loud the tires were too loud because like every year they&amp;#39;re reducing the overall noise that a car is allowed to make and um the issue was that the seat um was I think I think 5 mm too high yeah to be classed as a sports car and therefore the sports car noise restrictions did not apply and it was just not going to be possible for them to be able to make the necessary changes to the vehicle to to make the the R so they pulled it from the European market I mean I can understand why they banned popup headlights because you don&amp;#39;t want something to take a pedestrian and slice them in half y but that is ridiculous the tires were too loud the tires were too loud sports cars were allowed to let make a little bit more noise not much but just a little bit but to be classed as a sports car there was a a particular height at which the hips of the driver had to be yeah your H Point yep and uh that was about 5 mil too high yeah and if you re-engineer that you have to retest for safety and everything else you can&amp;#39;t just drop a new seat in there and say it&amp;#39;s okay the tire were too loud sorry I&amp;#39;m stuck on that because that that just seems an insane amount of Regulation rubbish I mean I know it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s people always want the old cars come back so I wish they they made cars that look like they used to you can&amp;#39;t do that now for stupid reasons like that y I think the whole noise thing has gone too far I mentioned this in the previous episode actually as it happens I just think it&amp;#39;s just got to the point now it&amp;#39;s like just because like why is it that I can&amp;#39;t have the thing I want so that you can have the thing you want why can&amp;#39;t we both have a little bit of both right you want quiet cars I want louder cars why can&amp;#39;t I have a regulation where the cars can make a certain amount of noise but not in a city center yeah not in a builtup area something like that when I when the valve system could be locked to the GPS and it can open up and I get speed just just do it by speed which was sort of how the regs worked anyway because you had you know they had various tests at speed and load and everything and there are some cars from a certain period where if you put your foot down at more or less exactly 30 in a certain gear there&amp;#39;ll be like a second or two of delay in a car that normally is really responsive 911s did this myor did this that&amp;#39;s because one of the tests is the leaving a town test when you&amp;#39;re going from 30 to National speed limit and basically by just Engineering in that tiny delay you&amp;#39;re then far enough away it&amp;#39;s a funny story um a gentleman I know who shall remain nameless for the purposes of this used to run a very large Italian sports car maker very well known and they would get the uh the standards people over to test various things and uh he told me that they had the chap coming over to make sure that the car car past all of the noise requirements of the day this is about 30 years ago so on the Monday they would fly them out to Italy whine and dine them Pastor them to death right until this bloated chap come sort of fridy midaf afternoon was sat there you know full of feta chy and you know lovely wine and then they&amp;#39;d go oh oh oh yeah um uh oh oh KY um we we we should do that noise test we which point they go oh yeah all right they&amp;#39;d look at their watch me yeah I&amp;#39;ve got like an hour before I get get the plane yeah all right fine fine fine so they&amp;#39;d get there they get their noise testing kit out they drive the car up to this chat switch the engine off Coast past and he&amp;#39;s down there going it was good pastor wasn&amp;#39;t it like uh yeah there&amp;#39;s his certificate yeah Lads I&amp;#39;ve got to get on the plane now uh can we get a taxi right that&amp;#39;s how they would do brilliant I mean you know there&amp;#39;s I I think everybody it&amp;#39;s got to the point now where even your regular or your regular ordinary drivers are getting irked by this invasive technology and again when I go to the states right they don&amp;#39;t know how to drive right when I&amp;#39;m on the freeway in the states I want every safety Aid that man has ever invented because they have no Lane discipline no concept of undertaking versus overtaking they are insane oorts and they drive too fast too close to each other and if you don&amp;#39;t drive like them they will eat you alive right so you need everything on your side I&amp;#39;ll turn all the cross check on Lane departure warnings everything right I need all the assistance I can get here in Britain we&amp;#39;re a little bit more sophisticated right we know a little bit more about how we&amp;#39;re driving but then of course when you get to the country lanes here like answers half of these systems are going to cause more issues than they&amp;#39;re going to solve so I just want them to be able to go away I&amp;#39;m sensible enough to know if I want to turn it on I want to turn it on can I not just have a hot key that says here&amp;#39;s my individual settings for the safety right when I you know I&amp;#39;m driving in certain situations I want Lane assist off but forward Collis I don&amp;#39;t mind too much you know cross check and all that sort of stuff fine fine fine and I don&amp;#39;t want people hitting me from behind either I know some people don&amp;#39;t like the active safety belt and all that sort of stuff but you know it it doesn&amp;#39;t bother me we&amp;#39;ve got airbags in cars now you know seat belts been standing up DEC AES like general safety standards are really really good but I like Honda I&amp;#39;m going to mention them again actually I&amp;#39;m going to mention the NSX again there&amp;#39;s a lot of carbon and fancy materials and things in the second gen NSX but do you know where they put some steel the a pillar because Honda thought you know what everybody says oh you know Steel&amp;#39;s very heavy and everything yes it is but it&amp;#39;s also very strong for its volume so they put Steel in the aill because it&amp;#39;s thin you could have done it with aluminium you could have done it with carbon fiber but it would have been bigger it would have it would have been just as strong but it would have been bigger so it would have obscured your vision they thought about these things I get in an old car even as recent as say 20 years ago the visibility is incredible you can see so much more even just turning around in a car pox stuff like in a modern car you&amp;#39;re so high up the Belt Line and the window is so high up I had a Kia EV3 the other day I actually really liked it as a car but just doing basic Maneuvers in certain places was terrifying I was so worried it was going to curb it cuz I don&amp;#39;t know where it is uh mirrors is the other thing so there was a reg change where the mirrors had to be bigger I think it was around 2008 I think it was around 200 no 2009 and I uh I know this because um uh the rx8s they r3s when they were in the sort of end of their life came with these much bigger mirrors and the S1 that came before had smaller mirrors yeah now I had the same experience from the 350Z to the 37 370 said the 370 has got these huge mirrors right and because of where you&amp;#39;re sitting and because the side of the door is relatively High when you approach a roundabout you can see Absolut Ely nothing about what&amp;#39;s going on I have to kind of like lean forward and reach up to look over the mirror to actually see what&amp;#39;s coming on the roundabout I think they&amp;#39;re actually less safe by being that size compared to the previous mirrors where I just kind of like have a little tilt to look past them to to to see the the roundabout absolutely terrible interesting should say this uh The Rake on wind screens on some cars uh my wife&amp;#39;s Cleo the way the wind screen is sh I don&amp;#39;t know if that&amp;#39;s just part of the design or part of the regulations the rear view mirror gets in the way so much of when you&amp;#39;re trying to look across Junction of things I&amp;#39;m forever and especially cuz I&amp;#39;m taller as well you should try G Aris yeah is that really bad there as well it&amp;#39;s right there it&amp;#39;s in the middle of the wind screen you basically can&amp;#39;t see the left hand side it&amp;#39;s DED isn&amp;#39;t that improved with the second gen a bit lower also um I don&amp;#39;t like tinted windows in cars because when you&amp;#39;re trying to park at night as well my again my y clear has tinted windows yes it&amp;#39;s got a reverse camera but I drive in a way where I still don&amp;#39;t want to just rely on that technology I want to be able to look like I pulled up onto your driveway when we came over a few weeks ago whatever it was and I&amp;#39;m trying to get in there and and and and not hit the 550 and and you know other things and I&amp;#39;m just looking like I cannot see anything cuz you have a security light that shines kind of at at the drive which means okay my mirrors are are full of security light that&amp;#39;s fine I&amp;#39;ll look out the back window can I no I can&amp;#39;t but tinted windows have been around for a very very long time and most of the RS around that have gotten better rather than worse I think my issue with tinted um glass and I think this is more what will is getting at is the fact that tinting used to be something you chose to do to your car now it&amp;#39;s almost a part of the trim level where they&amp;#39;re like oh we&amp;#39;re going to put tinted rear glass on because people like it we could the car without it I&amp;#39;ve got tinted glass on the F12 I I hate it cuz it ruins the side profile of the car cuz the side window is not tinted but the little rear 3/4s is so it looks stupid I actually going to buy some pieces that are not tinted um the rear glass is fine cuz you you don&amp;#39;t see it at the same time do you want to know something that is going to blow your mind right cuz it blew mine you know sometimes when you approach a roundabout for some reason I find this a lot more in the city than I do in the Countryside and they&amp;#39;ll have put stuff like signs or fencing or stuff so that you basically can&amp;#39;t see the roundabout until you&amp;#39;re on top of it you ever you experienced that and and you&amp;#39;ve been like this is stupid who the hell thought that this was a good idea I&amp;#39;ll guaranteed somebody thought it was a good idea so you&amp;#39;d slow down on the approach it is exactly that it is encouraged to reduce visibility on the approach to a roundabout with the theory that people will then will then slow down because they can&amp;#39;t see now do they also do this same thing where they just don&amp;#39;t bother repainting the lane markers on things so you have no idea what Lane you&amp;#39;re meant to be in until the very last second that&amp;#39;s Council laziness yes so there&amp;#39;s a town not a million miles away from here and where some scro had away with my Ferrari&amp;#39;s fuel cap see previous episode if you haven&amp;#39;t F going on there this town has gotten to the point now where you basically have to go on the wrong side of the road entirely because there are so many potholes at certain points they do go from the white line on the near side to the center of the road it&amp;#39;s bad it&amp;#39;s really bad and I drove through it the other day and I thought oh thank goodness they&amp;#39;re finally fixing it there&amp;#39;s yellow markers all around the big pot holes and then I realized that what in fact has happened is somebody&amp;#39;s gone down there with a yellow marker and drawn gigantic gentleman Parts all over the potholes I just thought the local LS have found the time to come down here and draw attention to this issue my thanks to them but the council just can&amp;#39;t be bothered this was a thing that was uh doing the rounds online that people were doing that and and and defacing potholes so the council be to come and do about that&amp;#39;s I think What&amp;#39;s happen and this is also we we spoke a little bit about potholes and things um previously and I think it&amp;#39;s an issue that does need tackling like if if we actually care about Road Safety let&amp;#39;s have some Road quality perhaps like that would be a good thing I think you know in Britain honestly hand on heart I think our general standard of driving is pretty good right it&amp;#39;s pretty decent like Lane discipline okay not spectacular but you know what compared to a lot of other places that I&amp;#39;ve driven it&amp;#39;s decent I&amp;#39;ve been in parts of particularly Eastern Europe I know other places are worse or just as bad where you&amp;#39;ll be driving along and an hgv full Arctic will overtake on what is a potentially unsighted Bend and they&amp;#39;ll be followed by another Arctic and I was in Trin and honestly the it&amp;#39;s like cars are literally just don&amp;#39;t care about the lives or existence of pedestrians no even at a pedestrian Crossing they&amp;#39;ll just keep driving straight through won&amp;#39;t let you cross it&amp;#39;s crazy I mean I remember going to Montenegro a long time ago and beautiful place amazing gorgeous scenery great food lovely people insane drivers right absolutely insane and they&amp;#39;ll ride around on scooters with minimal protection and short shirts flip flops that kind of thing and and it&amp;#39;s one of these places I was there for a week and I thought if I don&amp;#39;t see a nasty accident I I&amp;#39;ll be shocked and we were headed back to the airport and there was a bit of traffic and I said to my friend ugie who I was with is it normal for there to be traffic here you know cuz the whole time I&amp;#39;ve been there hadn&amp;#39;t really been much traffic and he said not really here anyway what we came across I&amp;#39;ll spare you too many of the details but imagine a uh like a 20 ton kind of rigid Lorry that sort of size like food delivery kind of but over there for whatever reason it didn&amp;#39;t have an anti underbar at the back of it oh no and there was an E46 3 Series convertible and the back of the Lorry went to just behind the rear passenger headrest oh no they didn&amp;#39;t out of that they did not they did not um that&amp;#39;s an image that will stay with me forever um and that would have been avoided by either a bit of common sense in driving or some forward Collision stuff so I&amp;#39;m all for a bit of extra safety in signing cars but yeah making them impossibly quiet I&amp;#39;m really not convinced who benefits from that the irony is that with EVS they&amp;#39;re now adding in the sound yeah saying You must have a sound when you&amp;#39;re going below this speed so that pedestrians can hear you but that doesn&amp;#39;t seem to be applying to uh ice Vehicles did I tell you guys when uh my mother was taking me to hospital for me to have an operation back in October and she&amp;#39;s not the the the the most uh how should we say confident driver and her car sometimes does beep and bong and do things that she doesn&amp;#39;t like and then she gets fixated on it and then what happens is is she nearly drove into a curb at 60 M an hour oh uh yeah and that would have been spicy that would have been I was thinking KY it&amp;#39;s a good thing I&amp;#39;m already fasting for surgery because I&amp;#39;m going to need it for different surgery crazy yeah so you know I love also like stylistically &amp;#39;90s naughties cars they&amp;#39;re pretty great I think manufacturers have just gone far too much down the whole everything&amp;#39;s a crossover on an SUV now route which is why I&amp;#39;m actually quite excited about this new batch of like electric hot hatches coming through some of the deliberately retro stuff that&amp;#39;s coming through like the Rena are leading the way like if the Rena 5 as well other manufacturers will cotton onto it um VW have obviously completely bused up with the ID3 I mean for a whole bunch of reasons it&amp;#39;s not a not a good car um I&amp;#39;ve yet to drive one but the cpra is built on the same platform so it&amp;#39;s very similar um couldn&amp;#39;t even clear its own windscreen don&amp;#39;t know how you get that wrong in a modern day car I I really don&amp;#39;t know um but yeah I I like &amp;#39;90s nauy 2010s and then suddenly for for me 7 years ago 2018 I was driving cars from before Co they were great they were fun they could make noise but they were safe they were decent you know stuff was there but you could turn it off and it stayed off or if you wanted it on it&amp;#39;ll be on and that to me felt like a really nice decent happy medium and you know what every time I think one day I would love to spec a car from new and there are so many cars that if I had had the resources I do now 10 years ago I&amp;#39;d have made that commitment and bought one of those cars brand spanking new now I mean I don&amp;#39;t I I I don&amp;#39;t really know what I I want you know it&amp;#39;s just because they&amp;#39;ve made they&amp;#39;ve been made needlessly complicated nuted in terms of sports cars and they just don&amp;#39;t they don&amp;#39;t give me the Fizz used to so what is the newest Ferrari you&amp;#39;ve driven then 296 we both driven it yeah that&amp;#39;s you both that was that the one with all the blue on it and that yeah Spiderman spec yeah so you compare that to say the F12 which is is that 2013 yeah so how have the Safety Systems which you&amp;#39;ve said you already already find a little bit annoying and intrusive on the F12 um the beeps and the bongs 296 actually uh didn&amp;#39;t really seem to suffer from it but I think it managed to get away with it some Ferrari and other small manufacturers do have certain dispensation to not do stuff like for example even the the Lamborghini Huracan Technica still sounded pretty barmy um just because I think it benefited from technically being an old model whereas Urus has always had like or you know particulate filters and and stuff like that in but um the new 12 cylinder I know has a lot more of these issues and things you have to turn off because it&amp;#39;s now a new model this stuff has to be in there so that is something that would potentially turn you off over wanting to own one then yeah so yesterday I think uh mentioned in the previous episode I went to the temporario launch the Lamborghini tamaria launch and um one of the cool things that they said which I thought was so cool at the end of that was um they were explaining how it&amp;#39;s a flat plane crank V8 twin turbo with a hybrid axal Motors Etc axal flux Motors Etc and he says and the V8 goes to 10,000 RPM y why you ask for the sound that was it that&amp;#39;s what he said in this presentation it was absolutely brilliant obviously it&amp;#39;s still going to be quietened to an extent but everybody knows that those muffers are coming out and a custom going straight in uh I was in LA and a revuelto came past me and that did not have a standard exhaust and it sounded ungodly yeah beani I know we&amp;#39;re talking about a really small portion of the market which is also why I feel so AG grieved because I don&amp;#39;t want regular average cars sounding like a bloom in THX reference test cuz I&amp;#39;d get annoyed at it but for that small breed of I just realized what you said um like for ordinary yeah like it&amp;#39;s why is it like old people always listen to Neighbors at Dolby reference level like you know I&amp;#39;d into my grandmothers and she&amp;#39;d be listening to neighbors louder than I listen to Saving Private Ryan right anyway um so I just cuz the thing with these cars as well from a business perspective the first thing when it comes to an exciting car is usually you you you see it or you hear it you know and that&amp;#39;s a big part of our connection with these things you know like you you you hear this thing you go oh my God you look at that you you watch it going past I mean Formula 1 why have Formula 1 cars got noise Rags what&amp;#39;s the point like they&amp;#39;re racetracks you live next to a racetrack like you you the RAC trck was probably there before you were like it does make me upset like anybody that&amp;#39;s ever been to an event with old V10 V8 Formula 1 cars like that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s a religious experience that&amp;#39;s wonderful but race cars are a topic for another day so speaking about noise quickly and exhaust and stuff um I&amp;#39;m probably one of the few people who isn&amp;#39;t a bike rider that does think that all motorbikes should have at least some form of noisy exhaust because from a safety standpoint cuz I had somebody filter past me on I think it was a 125 or 250 something the other day completely stock exhaust I had no idea they were there loud pipe saved lives exactly exactly that&amp;#39;s probably quite a true saying that I imagine it&amp;#39;s a very common one you get stickers to say it yeah I&amp;#39;ll get you one for the golf all right Jens any more on the topic I think sold me on 2018 and uh the main reason for that is the newest car that I own is a 2018 370 Z ismo mhm 2017 I&amp;#39;ll take it um because the being the year all went bad because that is when the tax brackets changed from cars going I think it was being able to get like 30 tax and0 Pound Road tax all it like £ 150 mandatory something like that after them uh they&amp;#39;ve changed it recently basically it&amp;#39;s £190 for everything I think EVS might still have not but unless it costs over 40 Grand in which case you get another is it 450 quid or is it 540 I don&amp;#39;t really pay attention because all my cars are pre 2017 anyway so um actually do you know one of my cheapest cars is to tax it&amp;#39;s the 550 that&amp;#39;s because it&amp;#39;s on it&amp;#39;s a 9 is it so it&amp;#39;s pre all of the 2001 change over mine&amp;#39;s a 370Z it&amp;#39;s like it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s the the 10 whatever quid category for some bizarre reason I think something to do with something to do with the uh emissions the um fun fact Audi RS3 from about six seven years ago uh if you wanted the optional wider front wheels very unusual two 35s on the back two 55s on the front I believe give us yeah they would put wider fronts on than on the rears okay I thought that was Lethal because sure some shop is going to look at that and go yeah someone&amp;#39;s fitted these tires the wrong way around anyway to get the Alloys was about another 600 Quid it cost you over ,000 more in tax because that extra little bit of rolling resistance just nudged it into the next tax bracket oh yep yep true story right well I&amp;#39;m sold 2018 it all went downhill from there and uh we all agree that making cars safer is a good thing yes 100% And there might be one or two of you in the comments saying oh no you know it&amp;#39;s better when people were dying sorry we don&amp;#39;t agree no um what do we do what could be done to make cars continue to be safe but still engaging despite everything that&amp;#39;s happening in the world I have an idea but I think technically speaking it is counted as high treason then don&amp;#39;t say that on camera or on air just just a button with which just turns it all off and it turns it all off and it dims the screens in the car and it turns off the Bings and the bongs and the vibration a memory setting exactly a mode which is called Old School mode there you go old old school mode that is what we if anything right okay like use the technology how easy would it be to put a simple fingerprint reader on a steering wheel so when you get in to confirm that it&amp;#39;s you and that you understand what you&amp;#39;ve signed up for fingerprint on the wheel yep cool hi Will we&amp;#39;ve put all your settings in we know that you&amp;#39;ve chosen to turn off the safety features have a nice Dy exactly I&amp;#39;d even take a little disclaimer coming up saying now remember these features are off and you just have to press the okay button yep okay or the other option is to press it down and go oh no not today hold it for 5 seconds like that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s all it&amp;#39;s all just one button nice easy that I can press cuz we used to have that with the lane departure on the Audi and everything you just press the button on the end gets ready Lane departure in fact when I did the GI Aris review right they said to me two things one of which sorry about the exhaust we have already given it to some tuning companies but you know rules is rules and the other one was hold this button on the wheel will you it&amp;#39;ll turn off the lane keep they knew yeah now you said that the regulations say that you have to have two button presses though now what I would do is I&amp;#39;d have two buttons on on the wheel this side that side you press hold it it&amp;#39;s all off yeah just something just it&amp;#39;s not much is it it&amp;#39;s not much or maybe we should just do what Rena do and just ignore apparently all the r is I thought the car was broken but clearly it&amp;#39;s a Renault thing and I don&amp;#39;t want to tell anybody and you know what also we will wrap up now I think you just did yes there is a uh there is another car we&amp;#39;re going to get you into this year which I think could go on your list of kind of classic not quite classic we&amp;#39;ve organized you a tuskin review oh I&amp;#39;m looking forward to that and he&amp;#39;s going to drive the Maestro I actually I am actually genuinely excited about that I am that&amp;#39;s cool yeah so I I think we should put it to the audience when was the best final year of Automotive heaven for you out there and what are your reasons for that particular year and also I have a little bit of homework for other people at home I want you to help me come up with some lyrics for the radiator arms theme tune I think we got something pretty good but we&amp;#39;re going to want to make an extended version we&amp;#39;re going to get James sing 12 in LP exactly absolutely we&amp;#39;re going to have a bside as well and it&amp;#39;s going to and it&amp;#39;s going to be something fabulous so give us some lyrics in in the comments below and you never know reget that I might sing some of them I I am actually really worried about what we&amp;#39;re going to read we better double up on those extra questionable words filter oh dear all right thanks as ever for joining us everybody here at the radiator arms I&amp;#39;ve been James joining me I&amp;#39;ve been ant and I&amp;#39;ve been will yeah see you soon and you know where there&amp;#39;s a will there&amp;#39;s a way and there&amp;#39;s a way to turn off this recording goodbye everyone right there you go jents",

Louisiana where that cheapest land at you thought you was going to be able to do it you thought you was going to be a to get them loans and it ain&amp;#39;t what&amp;#39;s wrong what&amp;#39;s taking so long I know you want to make your mama one of them walking Stars thing put down there [ __ ] how your mama live [ __ ] make her her own walking star get one of them Bell them blackheads on them [ __ ] skin damn D [ __ ] doing bad in 50 stop you left your last hole cuz of something they said had to do with me don&amp;#39;t leave Tonyo that come on and don&amp;#39;t leave Louisiana don&amp;#39;t quit like that cuz you show [ __ ] the picture of how you wanted it to look we call it renderings you you had the renderings then you try to go get them loans and ain&amp;#39;t nobody loan you that money you ain&amp;#39;t even built the GU in this studio yet that might be why when I stood next to meech your knees Buckle youro knees Buckle put your back against the wall po [ __ ] your PO hustling them black he talking about blackheads first shout out to uncle murder he&amp;#39;s saying that uncle murder Auntie murder as he no no we ain&amp;#39;t M that don&amp;#39;t do that and Tony yo that they have bad skin I guess why black people always argue with each other and insult each other&amp;#39;s skin care I didn&amp;#39;t know he was that close up Bon but I will tell you this um bro I&amp;#39;m very close to him and um Yayo I&amp;#39;m me and Yayo very cordial but uncle murder me and uncle murder you talk long history love you to listen to him a ton long long history and um he&amp;#39;s established himself we all look forward to the wrap up at the end of the year and and he&amp;#39;s showed 50 you know he was loyal enough to where 50 has positioned him for bro to be able to do his thing so you know um Ross had never he would never had that conversation with murder in person I don&amp;#39;t know why he attacking murder cuz murder really ain&amp;#39;t I don&amp;#39;t think he said anything no I haven&amp;#39;t seen that either but why why do you does this in any way make you feel like 50 Cent is broke because never in my life have I actually considered the 50 Cent might be broke at least in the modern climate bro he got threefold number one shows yeah you know what I&amp;#39;m saying like if he&amp;#39;s broke he&amp;#39;s really [ __ ] it up he has like a Vegas residency he&amp;#39;s on tour all that he just did this huge tour I mean not to say anything about the album sales over years and all this other [ __ ] I mean very hard for me to accept that 50 could be doing his thing uh you know both of them doing their thing but you know uncle murder thing I don&amp;#39;t know why he really playing with that he might want to lead out in the law yeah that&amp;#39;s crazy that&amp;#39;s a fact uncle murder like the one dude who&amp;#39;s managed to work his way into the gun troop exactly like in recent memory yo is the one who was able to hold it down yeah Yayo been it and Mur is the one person that&amp;#39;s managed to wiggle his way into position yeah so I don&amp;#39;t know why he disrespected murder that ain&amp;#39;t cool I didn&amp;#39;t like hearing that but nevertheless you know um I don&amp;#39;t think he knows uncle murder he can&amp;#39;t know uncle murder probably not not possible no I mean so this is how it opened though is 50 saying to Rick Ross and I mean it really it goes so far that 50 has such a big platform and that his fans seem to like really love this kind of [ __ ] from him so much uh he said nobody noticed this fo is opening for bowwow 30k a show ninja trying to sell wings and his car show tickets okay then I didn&amp;#39;t notice either he&amp;#39;s clowning them for getting 30k a show 30k sounds pretty nice not even the headliner well fifth going to do that and I don&amp;#39;t know if that&amp;#39;s the real number but you know 50 is a troll yeah and one thing I could respect about 50 is he does what he wants to do because he never he never turned into Curtis with these people yeah I&amp;#39;m 50 Cent the rapper so I could conduct myself any way I want to conduct myself and he don&amp;#39;t catch he don&amp;#39;t catch no flboy none no yeah it&amp;#39;s crazy none but he&amp;#39;s also the one person that there&amp;#39;s like nothing that you could really put on him uh what are you going to say it ain&amp;#39;t too much you can say you you made a song like 30 years ago that people said was snitching even though whatever um you got shot whatever I mean what what you going say ain&amp;#39;t too much you can it&amp;#39;s hard to it&amp;#39;s only it&amp;#39;s only one artist that ever gave him the blues when they was doing their dance and that&amp;#39;s the game and I&amp;#39;m going say that was an overall thing for his gunit other than that he been pretty victorious in all this all this bouts when me and you beef with somebody what are they going to say they&amp;#39;re going to immediately say some some [ __ ] to me with you they&amp;#39;re going to talk about you being on your belly with your booty up in the there which obviously we&amp;#39;ve talked about that a million times Well slow down okay I slow down hill today not in the air but you were flat on the bed I know I know I was like that till uh 7:00 this morning well we called Selena pow earlier and it was 7:00 p.m. Miami time and she was still in bed with the lights up yeah I mean [ __ ] hey bro I sleep naked bro I don&amp;#39;t I&amp;#39;m just saying at least they got something to go out it with us you know what I&amp;#39;m saying my sh my woman R&amp;amp;B is not allowed to wear any clothing of any sort any laundry any of that you&amp;#39;re damn right [Music] clous Clubhouse clubhous yo what up YouTube Club House TV back with another one and today we got wack 100 reacting the 50 Cent Straight Up clowning Rick Ross for opening up for BW and you already know when wack speaks on something he doesn&amp;#39;t hold back so let&amp;#39;s get on to it now this ain&amp;#39;t nothing new 50 in Rick Ross has been going at it for years from diss tracks to Legal battles and now 50s back on his Petty time this all started when Ross was seen opening for bow wild a recent event now most people would just let that slide but 50 he saw that as an opportunity to cook Ross and went all in on social media laughing at the fact that a big time boss is now opening for someone he outshines now here&amp;#39;s where wack jumps in wack had a lot to say about this situation and as usual he&amp;#39;s calling it like he sees it according to wack Ross might still have money but this move don&amp;#39;t look good for his image wack basically said ain&amp;#39;t no way a certified boss should be on stage before bowwow that&amp;#39;s a bad look but at the same time wack also pointed out the Ross might just be out here securing bags regarding regardless of the Optics so what&amp;#39;s really going on here is 50 just being 50 always trolling and taking shots at old enemies or is it just actually some truth to what he&amp;#39;s saying a lot of fans are split on this one some say Ross is just getting his money and ain&amp;#39;t worried about the order of his performances but others think this is a sign that Ross ain&amp;#39;t as hot as he used to be and of course wack is it right in the middle of it giving his take on how this affect Ross&amp;#39;s reputation now at the end of the day this is just another chapter never ending beef between 50 and Ross but what do y&amp;#39;all think does 50 have a point or is it just being petty and is wack keeping it real or is he just stirring a pot let me know what you think about the content in the comments
