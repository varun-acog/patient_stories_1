    "transcript": "Meet Eric and Tami. They&amp;#39;ve been friends since they were children\nand have recently found out that they share a challenging health diagnosis. They both have diabetes. Diabetes is a disease that occurs when the\namount of glucose or blood sugar in the body gets too high. It can be dangerous if untreated because high\nblood sugar impacts our ability to function daily and can lead to serious health problems\nsuch as heart disease, vision loss, amputations, kidney disease, and even death, if not properly\nmanaged. It&amp;#39;s important to know that there are two\nkinds of diabetes. Eric, who is now 46 years old, discovered\nthat he had type one diabetes when he was in elementary school. He complained to his parents about increased\nthirst, blurry vision, fatigue, and weakness. The doctor soon diagnosed him with type one\ndiabetes, which is usually found in children, teens, and young adults. It meant that his body can&amp;#39;t make its own\ninsulin or makes very little insulin, insulin, a hormone made by the pancreas, helps glucose\nget from our food to ourselves to be used for energy. Although no one knows how to prevent type\none diabetes, we do know that it can run in families. And there are about one and a half million\npeople in the United States with the condition. There is no cure for type one diabetes, but\nit can be managed. Eric manages his type one diabetes by taking\ndaily insulin shots, eating a healthy diet, exercising on a regular basis, and by visiting\nhis medical provider regularly for checkups. Tammy has type two diabetes, the more common\nkind of the disease, currently, more than 30 million Americans have this form of diabetes,\nwhich means that the body still produces insulin, but it&amp;#39;s unable to use it, effectively raising\nthe body&amp;#39;s blood sugar level. Tammy was diagnosed with the disease as an\nadult when she was 45 years old. Some of Tammy&amp;#39;s risk factors were being overweight\nand being a smoker. She is also African-American, and unfortunately,\ntype two diabetes has a disproportionate impact on some racial and ethnic groups. Unlike Eric, Tammy didn&amp;#39;t experience any immediate\nsymptoms. It wasn&amp;#39;t until she had a routine checkup\nwith her doctor when she was diagnosed. This is common for people who have type two\ndiabetes. Some people do not find out they have the\ndisease until they have had a diabetes-related health problem, such as blurred vision, increased\nthirst or unexplained weight loss. But unlike type one diabetes, some people\nliving with type two diabetes can manage their condition with a healthy diet and exercise\nalone. But in some cases, people may need medications\nor insulin to keep their diabetes under control. Tammy needed a little more support outside\nof diet and exercise, so her doctor prescribed medications that help her body manage the\ndisease. Eric and Tami understand that both forms of\nthe disease can be managed. They check their blood glucose level every\nday to determine whether that level is within their target ranges. They take their prescribed diabetes medicines. They both also make sure to keep their blood\npressure and cholesterol under control.

    "transcript": "DR. MANGIONE: Geriatricians face a lot of challenges when providing diabetes care, and the challenges really stem from the fact that most older\nadults don&amp;#39;t just have diabetes. They&amp;#39;re likely to have hypertension, many\nof them may have chronic renal disease, but they also may have things that aren&amp;#39;t directly\nrelated to their diabetes, such as osteoarthritis, chronic pain from other problems. I think the biggest challenges are really\nabout setting priorities and making sure that you keep things as simple as you can, but\nat the same time, making sure that you&amp;#39;re offering the therapies that reduce morbidity\nand lengthen life and improve quality of life for patients. Another big challenge with caring for older\nadults with diabetes is that it is a very heterogeneous population. Now when you think about it, if somebody is\n68 or 69, they could be a person who&amp;#39;s had type 2 diabetes for 30 years, and it could\nbe well controlled. But you can also have somebody at the same\nage who may have already had a stroke, who may have found out a year ago that they have\ntype 2 diabetes. So, we can&amp;#39;t just go with age. We have to really think about life expectancy. We have to think about what are the other\nchronic conditions that the person has under treatment. We also have to think about their functional\nstatus, and we have to think a lot about their cognitive status and family support. We know that older adults with type 2 diabetes\nare much more likely to get a group of conditions that we call the geriatric syndromes than\npeople who are of a similar age and don&amp;#39;t have diabetes. These geriatric syndromes include gait problems\nand falls, cognitive impairment, higher rates of depression, higher rates of chronic pain,\nurinary continence, and challenges with what we call polypharmacy. Medicare beneficiaries, oftentimes people\nover 65, will be on six or more prescription drugs. And when you think about how hard it is to\njust take one antibiotic correctly when you get sick, you can imagine what it must be\nlike to try to take all of these pills correctly every day. The probability of drug-drug interactions,\ncreating yet a third symptom, happens quite frequently. And as medical regimens get more complex and\nmore medications are added, adherence goes down. So, in addition to taking care of the diabetes,\nthese conditions really need to be screened for because many of them are treatable. And I have to mention that particularly depression\ntravels a lot with diabetes, and we have a growing evidence base that, if you don&amp;#39;t treat\nthe depression, it&amp;#39;s very hard, not only for older adults but for all adults, to take care\nof their diabetes. You really have to take a very holistic approach\nto the person you&amp;#39;re treating and, as much as possible, you need to engage them in shared\ndecision-making. So, with patients with type 2 diabetes who\nare older, the frail ones and the people with impaired cognition, there are a lot of family\nmeetings in these decision-making sessions. And we really, as a group, have to decide\nwhat&amp;#39;s going to be the most feasible and practical care plan to keep someone&amp;#39;s quality of life\nas high as possible, for as long as possible, and to keep the burden of our treatments as\nlow as possible. The Guiding Principles have a lot of very\nuseful information for taking care of older adults. And the document that came out of this process\nhas 10 guiding principles. They&amp;#39;re very practical. And for all of us who care for older adults\nwith type 2 diabetes, it provides a very efficient place to find that information. So, I would encourage you to look at it and\nincorporate some of the suggestions into your practice. I think you&amp;#39;ll find it helpful.",

    "transcript": "what is your body&amp;#39;s largest organ is it your liver maybe it&amp;#39;s your lungs could it be your brain well actually it&amp;#39;s your skin not only does it act as a barrier to things getting into your body but sometimes it can give you a sign that things are going wrong within the body this video I will share with you 13 signs that are linked with diabetes we&amp;#39;ll explore why they happen what to look out for and I&amp;#39;ll give you a real life example photographs and if you&amp;#39;re new here my name is Khalid I&amp;#39;m a family doctor who works in London let&amp;#39;s dive straight in this is called necrobiosis lepoidica and it&amp;#39;s an uncommon inflammatory condition usually starts as one or more small red raised patches on both shins you may also get other patches on other parts of the body like your hands or your trunk these lesions grow slowly and may sometimes join up to form larger flatter irregular shaped patches usually with well-defined red borders they may also have a bit of like a yellowish Center and visible blood vessels as well condition is most commonly seen in people with diabetes both type 1 and also type 2. we don&amp;#39;t really know the cause but some theories suggest that it could be damaged to areas that give the skin its strength so these are your collagen fibers okay on to number two these dark skin patches are called acanthosis negricans and usually they appear on your neck armpits groin anywhere where you might have skin folds the reason why it happens isn&amp;#39;t usually clear but it&amp;#39;s thought to be linked with insulin resistance which is one of the key mechanisms behind why people get diabetes this is also why it may occur in people who are overweight obese but also people who have other metabolic conditions like polycystic ovary syndrome and Cushing syndrome these tiny red bumps can occur around your ankles around your hands your arms and Accord granuloma annular the rash is not normally painful but it can be slightly itchy it&amp;#39;s not contagious and usually gets better on its own within a few months it is thought that the process behind why it appears as likely due to inflammation and it can be linked to a few conditions including diabetes autoimmune thyroiditis high cholesterol called hyperlipidemia and some very very rare forms of cancer the medical name for this condition is xanthalasma this happens when your body collects extra cholesterol and deposits it around the eyes so you might notice flat or slightly raised yellow growths on or around the eyelids these deposits are usually harmless but could signal uncontrolled diabetes or high cholesterol okay so if you develop a breakout a small reddish yellow bumps across your body this can be a sign of underlying metabolic disease and one of the main causes of this eruption is uncontrolled diabetes the medical name for it is eruptive xanthomatosis so what does it look like well it&amp;#39;s a breakout of these small pimply waxy bumps that can appear on your hands feet arms legs pretty much anywhere including your bottom the eruptions themselves are usually not painful but in some cases can cause a little bit of an itch the good news is again with most of these things it&amp;#39;s not contagious so you can&amp;#39;t pass on from one person to another this condition causes limited joint movement in the hand and its medical name is diabetic chiroarthropathy it&amp;#39;s quite a mouthful or you can just simply call it diabetic hand syndrome it&amp;#39;s characterized by waxy skin that&amp;#39;s thickened over the Palm aspect of your hand which reduces the mobility of your hand opening up especially across the mCP joints and your pip joints if you want to test yourself to see if you have this condition the simple test that we do in clinics is a prayer sign you basically bring the palm of your hands together like so normally you should be able to bring your hands together and have like full contact if however you have this kind of appearance of your hand and you&amp;#39;re not able to make like full contact with the palm of your hand on both sides then you&amp;#39;ve probably got this condition so if you&amp;#39;ve got this kind of bending of your hand and alternative test for this is something called the tabletop sign in which you basically will Pretend This is a table you place your hand on a table and it should all be kind of flat however if you notice that your hand is slightly kind of raised or hasn&amp;#39;t got full contact with the table again that&amp;#39;s a positive sign this is a book let&amp;#39;s call it the book Sign it&amp;#39;s always exclusive to diabetes you can get it with connective tissue conditions like Scleroderma but also other conditions like dupatron&amp;#39;s contracture and Palmar fasciitis as well now these sores can start with nothing more than a small bump or scrape and if you have diabetes then you are at higher risk of developing ulcers this is why diabetics have yearly foot and leg checks which assesses the leg for sensation and the development of sores and ulcers so why are diabetics more at risk of developing these well there are quite a few different factors on this one the very first one is the diabetics are more at risk of developing something called diabetic neuropathy what does that mean well basically it&amp;#39;s damage to your nerves imagine you&amp;#39;re touching something hot on the hob immediate reaction your body would have is to pull your hand away and that&amp;#39;s your nervous system working with your nervous system isn&amp;#39;t working properly like some people who have diabetes those little pains and pressure points don&amp;#39;t cause the same reactions so your typical pains and pressure points don&amp;#39;t really get registered by the brain so some areas where you&amp;#39;ve got a sore or a bump or a break in the skin will get bigger because you don&amp;#39;t have your natural body response diabetics can also have poor circulation and high sugar levels which can slow down the healing process and make them more prone to infections and obviously getting a wound infection is never good it can also delay the amount of time it takes people for it to heal and will come on to infections in a moment but first these are called skin tags they are super common lots of people have them it doesn&amp;#39;t mean you have diabetes if you have them but what we know is that if you are diabetes you tend to have more skin tags but what we tend to see is that sometimes you can get them as a result of diabetes the reason why people get it isn&amp;#39;t really clear but I think it&amp;#39;s a number of different factors including insulin resistance obesity or being overweight and also hormonal changes in the body it&amp;#39;s important to mention that most people with skin tags will not have diabetes and there also may be genetic reasons why some people get more skin tags than other people this is a common skin condition that affects people with diabetes these small round or oval shaped patches can typically appear on your lower legs especially on The Shins and they can be light brown or reddish in color and are slightly indented sometimes they have a slightly shiny surface to it too and again as you may have guessed we don&amp;#39;t fully know why diabetics develop it but diabetic dermopathy is thought to be related to damage to the small vessels around that Supply the skin and so poor circulation that changes the structure of your skin may also contribute to the development of these patches number 10 is a common complaint even among people who don&amp;#39;t have diabetes but itchy skin can result from dry skin or poor circulation both of which are more likely when you are diabetic on to the next one when you&amp;#39;ve got diabetes you have high sugar levels and this can encourage the growth of fungal infections fungi love to hang out in moist folds as we&amp;#39;ve talked about before and that includes your armpits your groin under your breasts around your nails but also in your mouth as well as we&amp;#39;ve mentioned before with high sugar levels our immune system doesn&amp;#39;t really work as well as it should do so people often get recurrent infections so if you&amp;#39;re getting lots of thrush infections either in your tongues or genitals or if you&amp;#39;re getting fungal infections on your skin or feet then it should be really important to see a doctor to make sure you&amp;#39;re tested to diabetes the treatment often is very simple with anti-fungal creams and it should subside after a few weeks now similar to fungal infections bacterial infections are also more common in diabetics this raises your risk of skin infections with staphylococcus being the most common one you may also get other types of of infections like cellulitis which is redness of the skin it can also be hot to touch untreated it can track up and spread around the body making you feel unwell makes you have high temperatures and again it&amp;#39;s important that if you&amp;#39;re getting recurrent bacterial infections like impetigo like cellulitis like folliculitis then it&amp;#39;s important to rule out diabetes and finally diabetics are also more prone to developing skin blisters these might pop up Suddenly on your fingers toes hands feet sometimes your legs they can develop there due to friction or if you&amp;#39;ve got neuropathy you may not have felt the irritation on your skin other times and more rarely it can be a rare sign of long-standing diabetes if you&amp;#39;re getting multiple blisters forming all over the body then it&amp;#39;s important to see a doctor and get it investigated okay there you have it that&amp;#39;s been your 13 skin size that are linked with diabetes but again the super important caveat to all of this is if you have one of these it&amp;#39;s not a certainty that it&amp;#39;s diabetes some can occur on their own some can be genetic and you could be absolutely fine some can be actually linked with other conditions but it&amp;#39;s important that if you&amp;#39;re getting a few of these or you&amp;#39;re concerned you might have diabetes most important thing is to get tested if you want me to go through the most common signs and symptoms of diabetes then click here to see if you have any of them once again thank you for watching I hope you have a lovely day and peace out",

    "transcript": "this video is very very very important\nso I would take notes I&amp;#39;m gonna try to make it really really simple but it&amp;#39;s a\nvery important concept you may have watch other videos with parts of this\ninformation but I wanted to create one video just to explain everything okay so\nwhat we&amp;#39;re talking about is how to prevent someone from going from a\nprediabetic state to a diabetic state now the difference between prediabetes\nand diabetes has to do with your blood Sugar&amp;#39;s so in prediabetes your blood\nsugars are around 100 to 125 diabetes it&amp;#39;s 126 and greater we&amp;#39;re talking about\nanother test called a1c which is an average of three months of your blood\nSugar&amp;#39;s we&amp;#39;re dealing with a 5.7 to a 6.4 with prediabetes and then once\nyou&amp;#39;re diabetic becomes 6.5 or greater so really when we&amp;#39;re talking about\ndiabetes type 2 we&amp;#39;re just talking about the elevation of sugar in your blood a\nnormal blood sugar should be about 80 okay\nand what that means is you have about a teaspoon of sugar in all of your blood\nokay so it&amp;#39;s not that much and you don&amp;#39;t need to consume a teaspoon of sugar to\nget that your body will make its own sugar out of fat out of other types of\ncalories okay so that&amp;#39;s what pre-diabetes is that&amp;#39;s\nwhat diabetes is now what happens is this an average person consumes about 31\nteaspoons of sugar every single day and I&amp;#39;m talking about the other\ncarbohydrates that can turn into sugar as well it&amp;#39;s not all just teaspoons of\nsugar so they&amp;#39;re consuming a lot of carbs roughly could be around I don&amp;#39;t\nknow 300 grams or even more for the average American\nso that&amp;#39;s crazy amounts of sugar now look at this a normal blood sugar is\nonly one teaspoon of sugar over here we&amp;#39;ve got 31 teaspoons so why is it when\nsomeone consumes a lot of sugar the average American why isn&amp;#39;t the blood\nsugar just screaming high all over the place\nusually it&amp;#39;s normal at least for a period of time well that is because we\nhave this filter right in the middle of this thing and it has to do with this\nmachine that keeps the sugar out of the blood and it&amp;#39;s called insulin so insulin\nkind of filters out and gets rid of the excess amount of sugar in the blood and\nwhat does it do with it it hides it it&amp;#39;ll put it in stored sugar called\nglycogen in the liver and the muscles it will also put excess in the fat it will\nconvert some to cholesterol but the thing that the body doesn&amp;#39;t want is high\namounts of sugar in the blood why because that sugar is very very\ndangerous to the lining of the arteries it will start to corrode and it&amp;#39;s called\noxidation or damage inside the arteries and then comes the plaquing and the\ncalcium and that whole thing so your body really considers excess sugar very\nvery dangerous if this person is consuming a lot of carbohydrates and has\na high frequency of eating having a lot of snacks what happens is you&amp;#39;re gonna\nget a huge amount of insulin being released from the pancreas and that\ninsulin is working really really hard to keep the sugar down but here&amp;#39;s the other\nthing high levels of insulin is also very toxic to the body as well so your\nbody doesn&amp;#39;t like high amounts of sugar or high months of insulin so what does\nit do it starts to reduce the insulin by creating a resistance okay it&amp;#39;s called\ninsulin resistance so the cells start blocking insulin like crazy the problem\nis the body still has to keep this under control so it starts to turn up the dial\nand produce more and more insulin to penetrate through this resistance to\nkeep the sugar at a normal level and this whole game continues for a period\nof 10 to 15 years so you may have insulin resistance for 10 to 15 years\nuntil all the sudden this pancreas says you know what it&amp;#39;s been compensating\nit&amp;#39;s been working hard to kind of counter this problem to\nhelp you but now it&amp;#39;s exhausted so the pancreas can no longer pump out that\nmuch insulin so this starts going down and down now we don&amp;#39;t have as much\ninsulin well guess what&amp;#39;s gonna happen if you keep consuming this amount of\ncarb at this frequency this sugar is gonna start to go up why because our\ninsulin is going down so the sugar is gonna start going up over time it&amp;#39;s\ngonna then turn into full-blown diabetes now understanding this problem is so\nimportant if you are a pre-diabetic or even you have insulin resistance because\nit&amp;#39;s so easy to solve with just a little bit of effort you can avoid this whole\nthing and it really has to do with cutting out the carbs and going on in a\nminute fasting now the other thing that I want to tell you is very very\ninteresting the doctors are focused on the blood sugars only they&amp;#39;re not\nmeasuring your fasting insulin level they&amp;#39;re not measuring if you have\ninsulin resistance the test that you would do to determine that would be Homa IR\nokay but that&amp;#39;s never done so this area is kind of hidden this is the area that\nyou see this happens later in life this happens way before 90% of people that\nare pre-diabetics don&amp;#39;t even know their pre-diabetics they just wake up one day\nand they&amp;#39;re a diabetic now I would say probably 99% of the people don&amp;#39;t know\nthey have insulin resistance now I&amp;#39;m going to tell you right now the symptoms\nto determine if you have insulin resistance even without taking this test\nokay all you have to do right now is just\nlook down and see if you see your belly if you see your belly and you can&amp;#39;t see\nyour your feet that we know you have insulin resistance here are some other\nsymptoms frequent urination even at night are you\ngetting up to the night in urinating this is\nyou have if you were just to change your diet you would notice this symptom\nimproving within a few days brain fog memory problems because your brain is\ndependent on this glucose and when you have resistance guess what you starve\nthe neurons with its fuel and you start becoming forgetful it&amp;#39;s the start of dementia\nbut when you cut out the carbs you&amp;#39;ll be running your body on ketones and you can\nbypass that whole thing and feed your brain and you&amp;#39;ll actually have a lot\nmore focus and less memory problems but here&amp;#39;s the big symptom right here to\nknow that you have instant resistance you cannot go a long period of time\nwithout getting hungry you need a snack between meals you need a snack at night\nthis is probably the big one craving for carbs is a big one or chips or some type\nof cracker especially at night is a big symptom tired after eating you want to\ntake a nap after your lunchtime we know you have insulin resistance tingling in\nthe feet or burning in the feet or any type of sensation in the hands of the\nfeet is right in this area right here it could be this area too that means that\nyour blood sugars are destroying the vascular system the capillaries to the\nnerves in your feet that&amp;#39;s called peripheral neuropathy very very very\nvery simple to fix all you do is you get off the high carb diet stop eating so\nfrequent I put some links down below of how to do this and just so you know\nsugar is very oxidative and it creates a lot of inflammation and the inflammation\nactually even makes this worse it actually can push you from here to\nhere just having the inflammation also omega-6 fatty acids like in all the\ndifferent oils soy oil corn oil cottonseed canola oil those are very\nhighly inflammatory that can also push you over the edge as well as msg like\nmonosodium glutamate it&amp;#39;s in a lot of fast food restaurants anyway I gave you\na lot information I hope you now have a deeper\nunderstanding of really how simple this concept is thanks for watching hey we&amp;#39;re back with\nanother amazing recipe no grains no sugar\ntotally keto there&amp;#39;s no suffering on keto absolutely not Karen and it&amp;#39;s an\nimmune system builder absolutely you have to check this out I think you\nshould hurry up watch the recipe and make it yourself it&amp;#39;s just so easy to be\nketo but is it simple it&amp;#39;s super simple we\nhope you enjoy making it as much as we are enjoying eating it",

guys eggs have been shown to reduce inflammation improve insulin sensitivity increase hdl which is your good cholesterol levels and change the size and shape of ldl which is your bad cholesterol according to a 2019 study eating a high fat low carb breakfast of eggs may help people with diabetes manage their blood sugar levels throughout the day so have breakfast have high fat breakfast every morning previous research has linked egg consumption to heart disease in diabetics but that&amp;#39;s not true however a recent review of controlled studies discovered that eating 6 to 12 eggs per week as part of a nutritious diet for your diabetes did not increase the risk factors for heart disease in people with diabetes there you go some research also indicated that eating eggs may lower risk of stroke hello everyone if you are looking for exclusive deals some blogs educational content every week delivered to your email subscribe to our newsletter at sugarmds.com right now number two greens with leaves now green leafy vegetables are high in nutrients and low in calories tada no surprise right but they are also low in digestible carbs or carbs absorbed by the body so they won&amp;#39;t affect blood sugar levels significantly now many vitamins and minerals including vitamin c are found in spinach kale and some other leafy greens according to some evidence people with diabetes have lower vitamin c levels than people with ass diabetes and they may require more vitamin c through the diet most of the time vitamin c is a powerful antioxidant and anti-inflammatory okay increased consumption of vitamin c rich foods can actually help diabetics increase their serum vitamin c levels while decreasing the inflammation and the cellular damage number three avocados avocados have less than one gram of sugar there are very few carbohydrates they have high fiber content and they&amp;#39;re healthy fats so they even spike your blood sugar avocado consumption is also linked to a better overall healthy diet good diet quality as well as lower bmi yes weight loss avocados are therefore an excellent snack for people with diabetes especially since obesity increase the risk of developing diabetes if you didn&amp;#39;t have diabetes that is still one of the best foods for pre-diabetics and insulin resistant people okay so it really helps prevent the diabetes in 2019 my study discovered that avocatin b or avob that&amp;#39;s a fat molecule found only in avocados inhibits the incomplete oxidation in your skeletal muscle and the pancreas and as a result lower your insulin resistance now we know that more human research is needed when you&amp;#39;re taking you know conclusions from the my studies but still there&amp;#39;s a lot of evidence to show that evidence that avocados can help diabetes prevention number four legumes i know not everybody agree with that but beans are an inexpensive and nutritious and they&amp;#39;re extremely healthy guys so beans are a legume that is typically high in b vitamins which you need minerals like calcium potassium magnesium and fiber which almost all diabetics need that in abundance they also have a very low glycemic index right which is essential for your diabetes management now beans may also help in what the diabetes prevention so if you&amp;#39;re pre-diabetic or insulin resistant also eat beans in moderation of course in a study involving over 3 000 participants at high risk for cardiovascular disease those people who consumed legumes had a lower risk of developing type 2 diabetes number 5 is chia seeds now diabetic patients will really love chia seeds if they try it right they are high in fiber and they are very low in digestible carbohydrates in fact 11 of the 12 grams of carbs in a 28 gram serving of chia seed fiber has no effect on your blood sugar levels now fiber can actually lower your blood sugar levels by how does the fiber do that by slowing the rate at which food moves through your gut and the way it&amp;#39;s absorbed now chia seeds can help you maintain a healthy weight because fiber curbs hunger and makes you feel full chassis may also help in the maintenance of your glucose control all day long if you had headed for breakfast a study of 77 adults with overweight obese type 3 diabetics they discovered that eating chia seeds promotes weight loss and helps maintain your glycemic control chia seeds have also been shown to help lower blood pressure and inflammation markers number six on the list is oily fish what are they salmon which most people love sardines herring anchovies their little people love and mackerel some people love that too they&amp;#39;re high in omega-3 fatty acids dha epa they&amp;#39;re beneficial to your health especially when you have diabetes right so i would say eat wild caught salmon or farm salmon even if you know where they come from if you know the farm et cetera now getting enough of these fats on a regular basis is especially important for diabetics because you know they are predisposed to heart disease and stroke now dha and epa protect your cells that line your blood vessels your endothelial cells and reduce the inflammation in there and may help improve the arterial function according to a lot of research people who eat fatty fish on a regular basis have a lower risk of acute coronary events which is your heart attacks and your strokes they&amp;#39;re less likely to die from heart disease even cancer again eating fatty fish may even help your blood sugar regulation just eating fish without changing anything now a study of 68 adults with you know with weight problems or obesity in that study they discovered that people who consumed fatty fish they had significantly lower post meal blood sugar spikes than those people who did not consume fish or did not like fish now fish also a great source of a high quality protein which keeps you full and helps to keep your blood sugar levels stable at least i will say five to eight hours after number seven is a greek yogurt now a long-term study that actually involved health data over a hundred thousand participants they discovered that eating yogurt especially greek yogurt on a daily basis was associated with an 18 percent lower risk of developing type 3 diabetes but it also can assist you in losing weight and keeping your blood sugar levels stable because of high protein and high fat content now yogurt and other dairy foods may help people with type 2 diabetes lose weight and you know of course improve the internal fat composition the visceral fat now yogurt also is what high in calcium right high in protein as we discussed and there is a type of fat called conjugated linoleic acid that can actually mill you feel fuller and longer now greek yogurt has six to eight grams of carbs per serving which is way lower than the regular yogurt so pay attention that you&amp;#39;re actually eating greek yogurt again greek yogurt is high in protein so it will help you with the weight loss and and try to go with the full fat i don&amp;#39;t really care if you know if you&amp;#39;re not trying to lose weight you can go for full fat now nuts are the next they&amp;#39;re tasty nutritious everybody loves them unless you have allergies to it and majority of the nuts contain fiber and they&amp;#39;re low in net carbs as you know and some contain less carbs than the others now regular consumption of variety of nuts and i think my favorite knot is walnut and almonds they have been shown to reduce inflammation and lower blood sugar levels and avon sea levels which is a long-term three-month marker for a for blood sugar management they even lower your ldl which is your bad cholesterol now nuts may also help diabetics to improve their overall health because it helps with the ldl right so in a study in 2019 16 people with type 2 diabetes involved and they are eating you know peanuts like walnuts and almonds and hazelnuts and pistachios i love that too those people actually in that study when they ate those nuts they had a much lower risk of cardiovascular disease heart attacks and strokes and of course it&amp;#39;s going to help your blood sugar levels if you&amp;#39;re consuming nuts as a synagogue for example now another study with type 2 diabetes when people consumed walnut oil on a regular basis even that helped the blood sugar levels well that&amp;#39;s really important because you know with the type 2 diabetes you frequently have insulin spikes or blood sugar spikes and you&amp;#39;re always looking for something to snack on i think a nuts will be your best friend now broccoli is your number nine why is broccoli so important well because it&amp;#39;s the most nutrient dense vegetables pretty much on the earth okay a half cup of cooked broccoli contains only 27 calories my friend and only three grams of digestible carbs so you can just eat as much as you want as well as like there&amp;#39;s vitamin c and magnesium in there which is super important for your diabetes now broccoli may help with the blood sugar management for those reasons now one study discovered that eating broccoli sprouts literally reduce your blood sugar levels so if you didn&amp;#39;t know that the food is medicine there you go broccoli you can use the medicine eat every evening with your regular meat with some meat dish or whatever is going to help you with your blood sugar levels now how this vegetable actually helps as a medicine because there&amp;#39;s actually things that are there&amp;#39;s some chemicals in there like sulforaphane for example they&amp;#39;re found in cruciferous vegetables such as broccoli and sprouts and so forth next one is gonna be extra virgin olive oil extra virgin olive oil contains something very important it&amp;#39;s called oleic acid it&amp;#39;s a type of mono unsaturated fat has antioxidant properties and it literally improves your glycemic control just like a medicine and it improves your not only your fasting but also post meal blood sugar and even triglyceride levels that&amp;#39;s again important for people with diabetes because you know they&amp;#39;re the one having difficulty with their blood sugar levels and the triglyceride levels most of the time at the same time now what else oleic acid does it actually stimulate a glp-1 hormone which is actually now used as a medicine so you can use olive oil as a medicine to improve your glp one function okay so you don&amp;#39;t have to necessarily take a medicine to do that if you need a medicine in the medicine i&amp;#39;m not saying don&amp;#39;t take medicine but you can use these foods for medicinal purposes for example in a large meta-analysis of 32 studies examining various parts of fat olive oil was the only one found to reduce the heart disease remember that polyphenols which are antioxidants are also abundant in olive oil now what does polyphenols do well they reduce inflammation they protect the cells lining your blood vessels again they protect you against the ldl cholesterol or oxidation of the ldl cholesterol and it also even help lower your blood pressure because extra virgin olive oil is unrefined it retains antioxidants and other beneficial features if you are trying to choose which olive oil you want to go for go for the extra virgin olive oil from a repeatable source again as many olive oils are most of them are blended with cheaper oils such as corn or soy oil so pay attention to that number 11 is flax sheets now flax seeds are known as common flax or linseeds or whatever you call it but they&amp;#39;re high in heart healthy omega-3 fats and fiber and other unique plant compounds lignans for example which make up a portion of their insoluble fiber may actually help reduce the risk of heart disease which most diabetics die from and it actually helped improve blood sugar management as well now they did a review of 25 randomized trials they discovered a significant link between the whole flax seed supplementation and glucose reduction here you go another medicinal food for you now flax seeds may even help with your blood pressure reduction which is almost as important as lowering your blood sugar in 2000 study in a study with pre-diabetic for example consuming flaxseed powder on a daily basis reduced their blood pressure and improved their glycemic control and insulin resistance as well again don&amp;#39;t expect this to happen overnight but if you&amp;#39;re having in your diet for a while you&amp;#39;re gonna see that we need more studies for prevention of diabetes but initial studies are indicating that the flax seeds are really good for your heart for your gut and for your diabetes again flax seeds contain a high amount of viscous fiber which improves your gut health insulin sensitivity and feelings of fullness which most of you i&amp;#39;m sure will like it right vinegar or apple cider vinegar so that&amp;#39;s also a known topic but i&amp;#39;ll explain a little bit uh both apple cider vinegar and regular vinegar actually have a lot of benefits not just lowering your blood sugar levels despite the fact that it is made from apples the sugar in the fruit is fermented into acetic acid so the finished product has actually less than one gram of carbs per tablespoon now data studies of course bunch of studies in the meta-analysis of these six studies involving over 300 people with type 2 diabetes found that the vinegar actually improves fasting blood sugar levels and eventually improves your a1c levels as well now other health benefits of apple cider vinegar include but not limited to antimicrobial and antioxidant properties and then we know that we need more research on this uh you can do more research definitely for this but we have a lot of benefits already proven now start with i will say two teaspoons of mixed in a glass of water which each meal incorporate apple cider vinegar into your diet we are coming up with our own apple cider vinegar gummies which is easier to consume but if you want to consume real vinegar then you may want to really dilute it and put some maybe lemon juice or something to make it more palatable i typically use it on my salads for most of my salads number 13 is are berries strawberries blackberries blueberries okay strawberries are they&amp;#39;re high in anthocyanins which are antioxidants that give them that red color so if you&amp;#39;re seeing a fruit that&amp;#39;s colorful go for it okay polyphenols are beneficial plant compounds with antioxidant properties that are present in these berries in 2017 a study discovered that consuming polyphenols from strawberries and and cranberries for six weeks actually improved the insulin sensitivity in adults with overweight issues or obesity issues even when they did not have diabetes well that&amp;#39;s really important because the insulin sensitivity or insulin resistance is a major issue that ends up causing the diabetes down the road and sometimes some people even end up with heart attack before they become diabetic due to insulin resistance now a cup of strawberries contain only 53 calories 12 grams of carbohydrates and three of that is basically fiber now this one serving also contains more than 100 percent of the recommended daily intake of vitamin c there you go just have some strawberries and you&amp;#39;re good again some additional anti-inflammatory properties as well now of course we&amp;#39;re going to talk about garlic right that&amp;#39;s number 14. garlic is incredibly nutritious considering it is small size and low calorie count right so again garlic has been shown in many studies to help your glucose management your cholesterol regulation and even your blood pressure management one clove of garlic weighs around 3 grams that&amp;#39;s it number 15 is squash well a lot of people love squash which is good right there are a lot of varieties of the squash of course but it&amp;#39;s one of the healthiest vegetables available now it is dense it is a fling food it will fill you up and typically has low glycemic index and fairly low calories now acorn pumpkin and butternut squashes are winter varieties with a hard shell as you know and there is a summer squash that has a soft peel that is edible zucchini and italian squash are for example our most common varieties when it comes to that and squash like most vegetables they&amp;#39;re high in antioxidants squash also contains less sugar than sweet potatoes so you can actually replace that instead of sweet potatoes right it&amp;#39;s an excellent substitute now pumpkin polysaccharides which are found in the squash have also been shown in studies to improve the glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity and of course lower serum glucose levels eventually although there has been not a ton of human research but as far as we know a lot of uh animal studies shows that squash actually can reduce your blood sugar levels relatively quickly now barrier melon is one of those that we use in our supplements which has the most highest potency in a concentrated form no wonder why we put in our supplement there now more human studies are needed to confirm that but again i would say squash is a safe bet for diabetics to get their blood sugar down now shirataki noodles are next shirtaki noodles are pretty excellent for dabbies and weight loss why well because these noodles are high in something called glucomannan glucomannan is a fiber derived from a konjac root we have other videos about this as well if you want to go back but this plant is basically grown in japan and processed into something called shritake it can be noodles or rice and like we said the glucomannan that&amp;#39;s present in there is a it&amp;#39;s a viscous fiber that makes you feel full and satisfied now in addition to that it has been shown to lower your blood sugar levels drastically after eating that and improve your risk factor for heart disease especially if you have diabetes or pre-diabetes or insulin resistance now there is a study for that as well now the glucomannan for example significantly decreased the fasting glucose serum insulin and cholesterol levels in diabetic rats shirtaki needles contain only 3 grams of digestible carbs and 10 calories per 100 grams serving these noodles typically packed with fishy smelling liquid some people don&amp;#39;t like that but they must be thoroughly rinsed before the use and you will be okay i promise the noodles should then be cooked for several minutes typically in a skillet over high heat and so forth without any added fat to achieve that noodle like texture if you&amp;#39;re into pasta and so forth well there you have it my friend i kind of came up with the 16 great foods that you should at least try look up some recipes and so forth and get it in place get in your diet i think you

    "transcript": "hi this week I&amp;#39;m going to talk about how to use intermittent fasting for type 2 diabetes and we&amp;#39;re going to go through it step by step and it&amp;#39;s coming right [Music] up when you think about type 2 diabetes the first thing to understand is what it is essentially type 2 diabetes is a dietary disease where your body has stored too much sugar so when your body stores energy in the form of calories it can store it as sugar or it can store it as body fat when you&amp;#39;re taking sugar in and you take too much your body&amp;#39;s going to store some of that away once you fill up that storage then it&amp;#39;s going to turn it into body fat and that&amp;#39;s called denovo lipogenesis so think of it like a refrigerator and a freezer for example so if you go to the grocery store and you have too much food for dinner that night you&amp;#39;re going to put it in the fridge once your fridge is full you&amp;#39;re going to move it downstairs to your basement freezer so there&amp;#39;s two different ways that you can store it up at some point if you keep buying too much food then everything&amp;#39;s going to overflow your refrigerator is going to overflow it&amp;#39;s going to overflow into your freezer when your freezer is full well then you just can&amp;#39;t store anymore and then that food is just going to be out on the table and it&amp;#39;s going to go bad same thing with your body body once it&amp;#39;s full all the sugar can get stored and it has nowhere to go so it&amp;#39;s just going to spill out into the blood as that blood goes up then you&amp;#39;re going to see that your blood sugar is up your doctor is going to tell you you have type 2 diabetes but the underlying problem really is that your body has too much sugar not just in the blood but in all of the storage compartments think about it this way if you have a car and you want to fill up on gas so you fill up on gas three times a day gas provides energy for the car just like sugar provides energy for our bodies so you&amp;#39;re filling up your car you fill it up and now your gas tank is full while you can&amp;#39;t store anymore but you keep pumping gas into the car anyway now that gas is going to overflow into the back seat it&amp;#39;s going to make you sick well what are you going to do well the first thing you&amp;#39;re going to do is stop going to the gas station the second thing you&amp;#39;re going to to do is start driving that car around so that you use up some of that gas and it&amp;#39;s no different for our body once we have too much sugar it&amp;#39;s just all our energy compartment storage compartments are completely full we can&amp;#39;t store anymore so if you don&amp;#39;t eat fasting then you&amp;#39;re going to allow your body some time to burn down those excess stores of sugar just like driving that car around so it&amp;#39;s really really no different than that and as you start fasting your body is going to use up some of the sugar as you use up some of the sugar you&amp;#39;re going to lose weight and that diabetes can actually go away does this actually work well it really is inevitable for type 2 diabetes that this is going to work because once you understand that your body has too much energy not too little energy and remember calories are a form of food energy then you&amp;#39;re just letting your body naturally use it up that&amp;#39;s precisely the reason you have those storage compartments of energy because it&amp;#39;s there when you have no food coming in then your body can provide the energy it needs so let your body use it for what it&amp;#39;s there for even back in 1916 Dr Elliot Jin one of History&amp;#39;s Greatest diabetologists said that it&amp;#39;s almost inevitable that it&amp;#39;s going to work he had such great experience with fasting that he thought that it was inevitable that everybody would just accept that this was the preferred treatment then of course they didn&amp;#39;t understand about type one versus type two and then when insulin got discovered a lot of the dietary treatments got forgotten about so let&amp;#39;s take you through how to do fasting for type 2 diabetes step by step the first step and the most important step is to talk to your doctor you have to remember that the medications that you&amp;#39;re being prescribed if you are on medications depend on that specific diet that you&amp;#39;re eating at that time so if you change your diet or if you do fasting the requirements for medications are going to change so you must have somebody to monitor that and adjust those medications for you and that&amp;#39;s the job of your doctor monitoring your blood sugars is extremely important because you want to avoid the sugars going too high if you adjust your medications and avoid them going too low which is the hypoglycemia and it&amp;#39;s very dangerous it can put you in danger if you find that you&amp;#39;re shaking if you&amp;#39;re sweating that&amp;#39;s a sign that you might have very low sugar so make sure you monitor your sugars something like a continuous glucose monitor um is something that is very useful for monitoring closely the sugars now sometimes people think that hey if my sugars are going low that&amp;#39;s not a good thing if you&amp;#39;re on medications well then maybe you need to reduce those medications remember when you&amp;#39;re using your diet or fasting to lower your blood sugars and your sugars go low that&amp;#39;s what you&amp;#39;re trying to do but it means you&amp;#39;re taking too much medication for the amount of uh food that you&amp;#39;re eating and therefore you have to reduce that medication and reducing the medication is a good thing if you&amp;#39;re taking less medication for your type 2 diabetes means your diabetes is getting better so the first step talk to your doctor monitor your sugars adjust your medications that is the most critical step and after each other step you always have to come back to the step and make sure you&amp;#39;re doing this safely the second step is to cut out all the snacks and go back to a sort of traditional dietary pattern of three meals a day and after dinner you&amp;#39;re not going to eat until the next day&amp;#39;s breakfast so if you finish dinner at 6 or 7 and you eat breakfast at 7 or 8 you&amp;#39;re talking about 12 to 14 hours of fasting and you should be doing that every single day the third thing is to adjust the foods in your diet so not just the fasting but really cut down those foods that are going to be really bad for your type 2 diabetes type 2 diabetes is a disease where you have too much sugar glucose is a type of sugar carbohydrates are a type of sugar so therefore if you&amp;#39;re going to get more energy from proteins and fats versus carbohydrates well that&amp;#39;s going to be a little bit better so try to cut down the sugary Foods try and cut cut down the refined carbohydrates the bread and the rice and the pasta for example because you know that if you eat bread your blood sugar is going to rise much higher than if you ate an egg we know that from all those uh studies with the glycemic index so try to stick with unrefined foods and try to stick to lower carbohydrate Foods the fourth step is to gradually increase your fasting period once you&amp;#39;ve adjusted the foods now you can start to gradually lengthen out that fasting period so you can go instead of 12 to 14 hours you can go maybe to 16 hours a day an 8 Hour eating window this is called Tim restricted eating and what you&amp;#39;re doing is simply allowing your body a bit more time to burn off that Sugar just like that car you&amp;#39;re giving it more time to drive around and at this step you want to go back and make sure that you&amp;#39;re doing step one which is monitoring your sugars talking to your doctor adjusting those medications if you have it the next step is to again gradually push that higher and you don&amp;#39;t have to do it every day but you may go to a 24hour period of fasting for example once a week and you might not do that every day you might start with once a week and then gradually build it up to twice a week or three times a week it&amp;#39;s okay if you&amp;#39;re feeling hungry that&amp;#39;s normal but if you&amp;#39;re getting a lot of low blood sugars if you&amp;#39;re just feeling very tired if you can&amp;#39;t get out of bed that&amp;#39;s not normal your body has an excess of energy not too little energy it has too much energy so if you&amp;#39;re feeling fatigued well that might be an indication of problems and that&amp;#39;s where you have to do it safely but fasting is a great tool for the treatment of type 2 diabetes a lot of people have been able to use it successfully to reverse their type 2 diabetes as shown in this article from Readers Digest they talk to a number of people who are able to reverse their disease simply by doing the intermittent fasting thanks for watching Everybody if you&amp;#39;re interested in it you might want to look at my video on type two diabetes and how fasting can help for more information thanks everybody I&amp;#39;ll see you next week",

    "transcript": "certainly my patients biggest myth often when I tell them that they may have type two or at risk is that they don&amp;#39;t eat much sugar type 2 diabetes aborally is a disease of excess weight to a level in themselves that leads to too much fat in the wrong places including within the liver nid satar is a professor of metabolic medicine at The Institute of cardiovascular and medical Sciences at the University of Glasco and an honorary consultant in metabolic medicine at the Glasgow Royal infirmary you know there&amp;#39;s 100 million people with pre-diabetes in the US people no longer store fat peripherally and that excess fat gets deposited into some of the key organs in the body that are exquisitly sensitive to too much fat you will disrupt their ability to control sugar levels I think that&amp;#39;s both a bit scary but also really clear is there a difference between men and women in terms of their risks of diabetes women have a lower risk of type 2 diabetes than mainasons linked to where they store body f is it possible to reverse some of this if you want to reduce risk of diabetes the key aspects are welcome to Zoe science and nutrition where World leading scientists explain how their research can improve your [Music] health Navid really ly to see you again thank you for joining me today pleasure Jonathan so we have this tradition on the show that we always start with a quick fire round of questions from our listeners uh and the rules are really simple you can say yes or no or if you absolutely have to you can have a one sentence to answer it it&amp;#39;s specially designed to be really hard for professors are you willing to give it a go cool for it yeah absolutely yeah all right are there millions of people around the world who don&amp;#39;t know they are living with type 2 diabetes yes does type 2 diabetes significantly increase my risk of other diseases like heart disease and cancer yes is it true that almost 100 million Americans have pre-diabetes that seems a high number it&amp;#39;s possible I think it&amp;#39;s probably slightly overestimated in my opinion okay let&amp;#39;s go and dig into that that is a quote from the CDC so I&amp;#39;m I&amp;#39;m intrigued to go into that if the food I eat leads to Big blood sugar spikes day after day after day can this significantly increase my risk of type 2 diabetes probably yes um but it would generally tend to do so through weight gain are women better at controlling their blood sugar than men women have a lower risk of type 2 diabetes than men for reasons linked to where they St body F I think we&amp;#39;ll definitely want to talk about that and then finally last question and and you you definitely can have a sentence or two for this one nid what&amp;#39;s the biggest myth about type 2 diabetes that you come across as an expert in this area certainly my patients biggest myth often when I tell them that they may have type two or at risk is that they don&amp;#39;t eat much sugar type 2 diabetes predominantly is a disease of excess in most people excess weit to uh to a level in themselves that leads to too much fat in the wrong places including within the liver got it and so they&amp;#39;re saying hey but I don&amp;#39;t eat loads of sugar so how can I have type two diabetes and the answer is they still do they still do and it&amp;#39;s predominantly they people can put on excess weight from a number of reasons not necessar just high sugar but also obiously lots of fat hi now it means a lot to me and the whole team that you are listening to this each week we put such a lot of hours into this podcast and we release this show for free without ads to help millions of people improve their health with Cutting Edge science in return all I ask is that you help us on this Mission by hitting the Subscribe button below it really helps thank you and on with the show well look let&amp;#39;s um let&amp;#39;s start to dive into all of this um and you know just to start with I think many listeners to this podcast know I have a personal interest in in blood sugar because my own blood sugar control is actually really quite poor um but I actually didn&amp;#39;t know this was happening inside me at all until I wore a continuous glucose monitor when I took part in the very first Zoe predict uh clinical trial which is about five or six years ago and it was a complete eye opener for me understanding that my blood sugar would often be very high for hours after I ate certain foods and was quite High you know even uh you know when I when I woke up in the morning fasting because I didn&amp;#39;t feel anything I had no idea about this um so you know I&amp;#39;m really fascinated in this topic now before I get carried away though and jump to all the things that I&amp;#39;d love to discuss about what I could do to improve my blood sugar control can we just start right at the beginning like and maybe just start with like what is blood sugar and why does it matter well sugar is one of the fuels one of the key fuels that many body cells require for making energy and for conducting the normal function so particularly of course the brain dependent upon PE for it to function and it&amp;#39;s it source of fuel for it to work for the cells to work um as well as requiring oxygen it&amp;#39;s also when we are sick the body is very good at preserving trying to preserve sugar for your immune cells the cells that fight off infection or help um repair tissues um and again they require lots of fuel for that for those mechanisms fight off infection or repair tissues and therefore when you are sick it makes sense the body tries to preserve sugar more for those cells but it&amp;#39;s required sugar is required for all body cells basically for them to function normally it&amp;#39;s and one of the things I think that often gets people often mention when they talk about diabetes you often hear this word insulin um what is insulin and and why does it ever come up in a discussion around blood sugar and and diabetes so insulin is uh it&amp;#39;s a hormone um so if I was to and I&amp;#39;ve just eaten a banana and I my body is breaking down that banana putting its breakdown products one of which is sugar into my blood but I will don&amp;#39;t want it to be my blood for very long I want to be able to store that energy in various tissues insulin is a bit like a key that opens up some of my cells to take in that sugar and store it when I don&amp;#39;t need it this also stops my own body making sugar when I don&amp;#39;t need it so I&amp;#39;ve just had a lot of sugar hopefully my insulin starts to go up put the sugar in the right places and it&amp;#39;s also probably signaling to my liver stop you don&amp;#39;t need to make any more sugar because there&amp;#39;s already Lots coming in so it&amp;#39;s like a master regulator of keeping sugar levels within the right levels in the blood putting it in the places where you need it to store for future needs and also helping you liberate it when you need it um and that that actually happens when the insulin levels go right down so that perhaps when you&amp;#39;re sleeping and you&amp;#39;re not having sugar in your body your sugar levels uh your insulin is low down and the liver keeps making sugar sufficient to feed all the cells and your brain Etc um you know to for normal Bly function so insulin is a master regulator in all of us for our sugar levels and thank you n is really really clear I think so you&amp;#39;ve got this sort of insulin keeping things level I guess the obvious question is why doesn&amp;#39;t our body just let all the sugar hang around in our blood you know like the fridge you just keep putting more stuff in it and then you know my brain or whatever else could take the sugar out um when they want it why is it why can&amp;#39;t I just let it get higher and higher yeah I know that&amp;#39;s a brilliant question so when if you think about sugar if you spill sugar particularly in the context of water it becomes very sticky when sugar becomes levels become very high in the blood it starts to stick to low of our bodily proteins and changes their function makes them abnormal so for example um some of the damage that happens in the eye is because the sugar very high level starts to stick so lots of proteins are relevant to to to um aspects of an eye function and disrupts it and you lead to what&amp;#39;s known as retinopathy damage to the eyes the same thing happens in the kidneys the same things happens to some of the bodily Parts proteins that relevant to nerve function so sugar levels when they&amp;#39;re high effectively disrupts lots of uh uh raw materials proteins in our body and disrupts therefore lots of normal function and causes damage I think that&amp;#39;s both very clear and very it&amp;#39;s quite scary this analogy with like the sugar on the table sticky I can see that that&amp;#39;s not what you want sort of causing through your blood it it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s a process partly called gation and effectively it changes the structure of your molecules from what&amp;#39;s normal to abnormal and then that means it&amp;#39;s almost if if you think about it is you know if you&amp;#39;re building a house and you start to make bricks and the wrong shape that building is going to be disrupted and will potentially not be have the same level of integrity and will be disrupted and fall apart that&amp;#39;s effectively what&amp;#39;s happening inside your eyes your kidneys your nerve cells if your sugar levels are high you&amp;#39;re you&amp;#39;re changing the structure of protein so they they no longer do what&amp;#39;s healthy and you you&amp;#39;re building up tissues and an abnormal way that leads to disease thank you so much nid I think that&amp;#39;s both a bit scary but also really clear could you explain then what happens when someone gets pre-diabetes or type 2 diabetes what what does that actually mean so this is an area of um yeah this is a question that&amp;#39;s often happened people living with pre-diabetes uh do have a higher risk of obviously developing diabetes they don&amp;#39;t inevitably develop diabetes so the so the the term pre-diabetes is doesn&amp;#39;t mean that it&amp;#39;s always inevitable people who have pre-diabetes some stay in that level for years others can actually go back to normal levels of sugar or that because if they prove their lifestyle um but if you do have pre-diabetes your risk of developing diabetes is clearly higher equally your risk of heart disease is about double compared to people have normal GL you know sugar levels don&amp;#39;t have pre-diabetes or healthy levels of glucose um I just want to make sure I got that you&amp;#39;re saying that if you have pre-diabetes your risk of heart disease is actually double the level if you don&amp;#39;t have pre-diabetes roughly speaking but here&amp;#39;s the here&amp;#39;s the rub it at the level of pre-diabetes that risk is not nestly caused by sugar levels because they&amp;#39;re not at the level of diabetes what what is caused by is the processes that have led to you to develop pre-diabetes in the first place so for example for for me to develop pre-diabetes I would probably need to put another four or five Kil gr of weight on that excess weight will also mean my blood pressure will go up it will also mean my blood fats and my cholesterol levels will be disrupted so then I will have higher weight higher blood pressure more abnormal um toxic levels of lipids and possibly also other changes and those are the things that cause my higher risk of heart disease um they will also in a sense they&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re stressing my sugar levels I&amp;#39;m able to keep them still within the non-diabetes range but they&amp;#39;re being stressed because I&amp;#39;ve put fat in the wrong places in my body and nid ju I just want to make sure because you that we all understand what PRI pre-diabetes and diabetes is and then I&amp;#39;d love to understand more the way these are linked so what does it mean for someone to have pre-diabetes or or type two diabetes and how is that linked to their blood sugar that we were talking about a minute ago so let me explain it in the terms of a hemoglobin A1c level which is a common test that we use um that gives us an average sugar level for an individual over three months so our normal hemoglobin A1c uh in the UK doesn&amp;#39;t really matter about the units is you know is is 41 milles per mole or under hopefully you and I sitting here have got levels of you know I don&amp;#39;t know somewhere between 32 and 41 okay pre-diabetes within UK and uh other you know in Europe is between 42 and 47 diabetes is when you get to 48 and above and that in America pre-diabetes is criteria is a bit wider than we use in the UK it&amp;#39;s from 39 to 47 which is probably why the category perhaps over 100 million I don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s quite as high as that there&amp;#39;s always some interpretation based on CDC data that they have to extrapolate and Bas you know a few caveat but nevertheless that&amp;#39;s what it is um in in older hemoglobin A1 terms the levels we had in our mind was diabetes is at 6.5% we use the percentage pre-diabetes is from 6 to 6.4 in the UK or from 5.7 to 6.4 in the US and effectively that&amp;#39;s hemoglobin A1c and it&amp;#39;s capturing your average sugar levels your average exposure to sugar levels for 3 months it&amp;#39;s a very good stable measure that we we measure in the clinic all the time increasingly is used to diagnose diabetes or diagnose pre-diabetes and I&amp;#39;ve heard doctors often refer to this as hba1c is that right hb1c hemoglobin e1c and so the way I understand I just want to make sure I&amp;#39;m playing it back right the way I understand it is you know your blood sugar is changing all the time so you ate that banana right now and your blood sugar is probably starting to like shoot up then you&amp;#39;ll put in the insulin you describe not come back down and this hba1c is sort of like this average measure of your blood sugar like a sort of like something on the tank on the car that&amp;#39;s is telling you like what the average is over like months um rather than this thing that&amp;#39;s changing all the time is that that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s perfectly correct so um you know if I&amp;#39;m able to after my banana keep my sugar levels from going too high and keeping within the normal range might you know and I and every time I eat food if I keep it relative within the normal range my hba1c will stay within the normal range because on average my sugar levels are I&amp;#39;ve been kept normal amazing and so to make sure that I um I just want to make sure that that I&amp;#39;ve got this you&amp;#39;re sort of saying you know we all have um like a level of sugar that we would normally have in our blood we can measure it with this this hba1c and if somebody&amp;#39;s been diagnosed who&amp;#39;s listening to this with pre-diabetes or type 2 diabetes this is higher than it should be um and this is the concern and we&amp;#39;ll then talk a bit more about um uh about what it means and what you might be able to do about it that&amp;#39;s broadly correct I mean and the reason I think I&amp;#39;m you know clearly we can measure sugar levels they can also give us an indication you know particularly when you&amp;#39;re fasting that you know we think the sugar level should be below 7 mli mes per liters we can do it fasting but the move in certainly in the UK and also in the US and many other countries in the world to diagnose diabetes they&amp;#39;ve increasingly started using HB hba1c because of its stability because it doesn&amp;#39;t need to be done fasting because it can also be measured when people have infections or admitted to hospital because none of those things are going to change on average for three months so it&amp;#39;s a very good aggregated marker now it&amp;#39;s not perfect all the time there are some circumstances like people have very severe anemia or they have a certain different type of hemoglobin so-called hemoglobinopathy you know we have to be slightly careful but that&amp;#39;s a very very small small percentage of the population for the so therefore the vast majority of circumstances hba1c is a very good aggregated measure of sugar exposure that your body has been exposed to and gives us an indication of whether you have pre-diabetes diabetes or an anol AG so I think the obvious F on question is it&amp;#39;s why has there been this enormous explosion in people with diabetes and pre-diabetes the team was sharing again some of these stats and apparently there&amp;#39;s a sort of fourfold increase in the number of people with diabetes around the world to like hundreds and hundreds of millions of people um and I know that when we look at our own data of people doing the Zoe study of who there&amp;#39;s hundreds of thousands you just see this ex you see there&amp;#39;s lots of people whose levels are far far lower than the levels you&amp;#39;re describing of people with diabetes so clearly you know there&amp;#39;s a big shift I guess from I think about like my children I I don&amp;#39;t know what their hba1c is but I&amp;#39;m pretty confident it&amp;#39;s a long way below these these levels right they aren&amp;#39;t there so what&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s going on what is what is causing what I think I I think we could sort of describe as an epidemic of type 2 diabetes with all the scary um implications you&amp;#39;re describing and why is it like so much um more common now like even when I was a child growing up okay so I think that&amp;#39;s you know it&amp;#39;s obviously a brilliant question I&amp;#39;m sure many listeners can work out some of the major causes and one of them of course is um Rising levels of weight and and waste girths in society um because as you put on more weight as people put on more weight and as as average body mass index levels or whatever waste circumference levels have risen in the communities that means um people more people have got to the point where they can no longer store fat peripherally and that fat excess fat gets deposited into some of the key organs in the body that are exquisitly sensitive to too much fat and it and and and and are relevant to how well you either make or store Sugar and if you put too much fat in some of these organs you will disrupt their ability to control sugar levels so for example too much fat in the liver means that it will continue to make excess sugar in excess of the body&amp;#39;s needs when you don&amp;#39;t need it too much fat in muscles means that your body will not take up the sugar in response to insulin as well as it normally would do if your fat levels and the muscles were less as a simple example so weight gain is one of them another key factor is actually it&amp;#39;s actually linked to success in part another risk factor for diabetes actually living longer older so as life expectancies have gone up and more and more people living longer we get more diabetes and part of that reason happens is this in my simple mind there&amp;#39;s three things that determine diabetes risk the weight you reach and how much fat you put in your organs your muscle mass because that&amp;#39;s your engine to burn up sugar and how well your pancreas works now two of those three things probably all three things change with age as we age our muscle mass goes down a pancreas becomes less which is the organ that makes insulin becomes less plastic as it were I it&amp;#39;s its capacity to make more insulin to keep the sugar levels down becomes less over time and also as with age we tend to put on more weight in our stomachs and we tend to lose fat from our peripheries and our arms and legs and our you know in peripheral reasons so with people living longer we&amp;#39;re also uh increasing the likelihood of diabetes and that&amp;#39;s not just in high income countries if you think about all the millions of people billions in fact in low-income countries as they&amp;#39;ve prove their hygiene gradually and you know industrialization people are no longer dying in their 30s and 40s are living to the 40s and 50s so they&amp;#39;re able to develop diabetes in the 50s and 60s when they didn&amp;#39;t because they died with infection or something else so there&amp;#39;s multiple reasons but so weight gain increase life expectancy are probably the two major ones and so n i i i just want to I want to unpack that and make sure that um that I&amp;#39;ve understood it and our listeners have understood it um fully so maybe to start with the first one I think you said something really interesting which is um it&amp;#39;s about Rising levels of weight in particular places so it&amp;#39;s not just generically whether um someone has put on weight you&amp;#39;re saying it&amp;#39;s about the fact that that weight is actually being stored so that fat is actually being stored inside crucial organs in our body and that that is really what starts to um trigger the diabetes did I understand that right so yes that&amp;#39;s so-called ectopic fat fat where it normally isn&amp;#39;t supposed to be in any sort of high level so as an example um all of our liver fat level should be below 5% ideally usually if you look at the normal range under 2% but when the liver accumulates more fat because you your your body has been unable to store the fat in other areas because your weight&amp;#39;s got to such a level the body is looking for other places so that excess fat one of which then tends to be the liver as the liver fat levels go up that disrupts the liver&amp;#39;s ability to regulate sugar levels normally and the liver actually starts to make excess sugar beyond the body&amp;#39;s needs which then keeps the sugar levels high so that&amp;#39;s one of the examples uh so ectopic fact it&amp;#39;s not the only cause some people also have um shall we say pancreases which make insulin which are unable to make as much insulin uh as perhaps an healthy individual so that for each even when they&amp;#39;re not very overweight their pancreas pancreas is ability to make insulin becomes diminished with age very quickly and then and it&amp;#39;s a pancreatic driven type 2 diabetes but even there if you know genetically if you can&amp;#39;t make as much insulin as the other person it&amp;#39;s still usually weight gain that&amp;#39;s to trigger for diabetes and people then tend to have to put on less weight to get that diabetes so there&amp;#39;s an interaction between how well you put Incas can make insulin how much fat you put in the wrong organs and how good is your muscle mass I sorry n can I just just before you jump on because I think the weight in your organs affecting the way that they work that makes sense and you&amp;#39;re describing the pancreas as an as as one of these examples it&amp;#39;s so important it&amp;#39;s making the insulin could you just explain the muscle mass for a minute why does the muscle mass have any impact on Diabetes so the key sort of organ you know muscle mass is often uh it&amp;#39;s uh measure of how active you are so activity plus um you know as an example you know my muscle mass used to be not so good it&amp;#39;s actually probably a bit better now I&amp;#39;ve got a dog and a psycle and so on congratulations that&amp;#39;s yeah well you know and my HDL has gone up and I can see it I can see it as a Bome it&amp;#39;s gone up you know really almost doubled um which is a good thing which is a very good thing because I do have a I have a family history so I think my pancreas probably genetically South Asian of fan history is it&amp;#39;s got a it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s got a lower Reserve to keep making insulin to the levels I need to overcome you know this any resistance in my tissues as it were so by building up muscle and being more active I have a an engine that burns sugar more so that means I&amp;#39;m I&amp;#39;ve got an engine that can burn sugar that means that sugar is not going to stay as high if that makes sense oh also will burn fat as well so by having more muscles it&amp;#39;s actually going to pull the sugar out of my blood it&amp;#39;s going to burn it up so that&amp;#39;s like it&amp;#39;s improving everything and if I don&amp;#39;t have that I&amp;#39;m more likely to store it in my liver and my p a car it&amp;#39;s a bit exactly it&amp;#39;s like having a very efficient engine um and a bigger engine for the amount of fuel if you overpack the car with fuel you know too much oil the oil will disrupt the engine um you know and if you&amp;#39;ve got if you keep the engine clean and bigger it may be able to coope with more oil is that you know is that kind of simple analogy you and can I can I follow up on the the point about the differences between people because I&amp;#39;m really interested in that and um you were just talking about being you know South Asian Heritage and love to understand a bit more about that but I I the other thing I was interested in is sort of difference between men and women because I know that when we&amp;#39;ve had other conversations to do with other risk factors um we&amp;#39;ve had this conversation about women particularly before menopause sort of storing uh fat in different places and is that um is there a difference between men and women in terms of their risks of diabetes as as well so I&amp;#39;m really curious about for people listening how these things might be different per on who they are yeah well let&amp;#39;s explain all those risks in the prism of where you store the fat um so women generally have a much greater subcutaneous you know so they able to store fat peripherally uh thighs legs and obviously you know the shape of women is such that you know they have other stores of fat shall we say so women generally um in a sense have a greater storage capacity for fat in the peripheral area that means they have to put on more weight over all before that fat starts to seep into the liver and peripheral just to make sure basically because for anybody who&amp;#39;s not seen the video where nid is helping to indicate you&amp;#39;re basically saying everywhere that&amp;#39;s not sort of in my torso and around my my belly that women can store a lot more fat there and part the reason women have to store more fat is partly because women have children they have to feed the children they have to breastfeed they have to supply nutrients to the child you know one of the things that happens in pregnancy is the placenta can suck lots of nutrients from Mom so if Mom you know if and if Mom doesn&amp;#39;t have enough fat storage they can&amp;#39;t often get pregnant you see that in athletes so you like need like your body is like you talking about like Evolution over millions of years years not like necessarily doesn&amp;#39;t mean you as a person listening to this have to get pregnant but the point is that&amp;#39;s how our bodies have evolved yeah that&amp;#39;s exactly right so if you compare men and women in terms of how much fat they have in their liver even in healthy levels men tend to have higher levels of fat within their liver compared to women that means uh and also men when they generally put on weight it usually is accompanied by their waste circumference going up straight away because they tend to store it you know they&amp;#39;re all all closer already to the threshold of uh fat going into the wrong places so with a little weight gain men&amp;#39;s fat usually goes into the wrong places women however generally can put more fat in in peripheral regions into the thighs and other areas before it goes into the more harmful places like the liver and muscle as it were so that explains why men in every ethnic group at a higher risk of diabetes and women for type 2 diabetes it probably also explains in part why men at higher risk of heart disease than women in all ethnicities by and large and with that same prism if you compare you and I Jonathan uh you&amp;#39;re you know you&amp;#39;re sitting there you know you&amp;#39;re you&amp;#39;re Caucasian or white I&amp;#39;m South Asian we know that South Asians on average have 10% on average lower muscle mass and carry more fat Mass already and I we also have higher levels of liver fat even when we&amp;#39;re healthy so me compared to you I&amp;#39;ve got higher level fat so I&amp;#39;m closer to where I&amp;#39;m going to put too much fat in my liver sufficient to develop diabetes than you are you are closer than the average you know say an age comparable women so that explains the men versus women risk it also explains the whites versus nonwhites and every nonwhite individual compared to whites are at higher diabetes risk one of the reasons is where people put the fat it&amp;#39;s not the only other reason blacks I think there&amp;#39;s another mechanism we don&amp;#39;t fully understand is maybe to do with how well your pancreas can make insulin but certainly for South Asians we&amp;#39;re in a sense our body makeup is such that we are for less weight gain we will start putting fat into the wrong places and therefore we will develop diabetes at lower average weight gains than wh hi I want to take a quick break here and tell you about something new we&amp;#39;ve created a free guy that will Kickstart your journey to a better gut health so how can

differences you&amp;#39;re describing aren&amp;#39;t they NV because I feel like in general when you talk to a lot of scientists um then it feels like often they they&amp;#39;ve ended up coming to the conclusion that you know even genetics in general never mind ethnic differences are sort of you know ending up being quite small versus environment but here you&amp;#39;re talking about quite important differences it sounds like in terms of risk factors based on sort of your ethnicity is that did I understand that right yeah no you&amp;#39;re correct so roughly speaking South Asians risk for diabetes so you know comparing age by age and you know sex by sex um somewhere between two to fourfold higher risk of type 2 diabetes two to four times higher so that is an enormous difference in in RIS and even within the southe you know South Asian groups there is a gradient of RIS so the highest groups in the big countries is actually in Bangladesh then it&amp;#39;s Pakistan then it&amp;#39;s India and a nice re you know a potential explanation for why Bangladesh&amp;#39;s compared to pakistanis is height and and early growth because height is aoxy for how much muscle you have Bangladesh is tend to be shorter than Pakistani so tend to be shorter than Indian on average it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s fascinating the one thing I would say is of course these are just averages and so you can have this huge because I mean and listeners will have heard this I don&amp;#39;t want to bore them but um I uh actually have quite a lot of fat stored around my belly in terrible places and very little anywhere else which I had no idea of until as part of that first Zoe clinical study I actually had a Dexter scan and I remember the face I remember the look on the nurse doing it who was like really surprised and the answer was I&amp;#39;m apparently what&amp;#39;s I think it&amp;#39;s called like a toffee or something like this um and it turns out that I have um uh fat nicely stored around my liver and elsewhere and I remember Tim explaining to me that this was really bad news um and so of course there are these ethnic differen but there&amp;#39;s obviously also very big personal variation which is why you know some person I guess is much more risk of diabetes than um than something else I mean and there may be various genes that play as well and and you know the question I would ask if if you were my you know if you were one of my patients Jonathan is do you have a family history of type two diabetes your BMI is obviously not high it&amp;#39;s pretty good um and you know it may not be that actually this is a BMI Factor clearly because you&amp;#39;re not you know you&amp;#39;re clearly you not heavy it may be that you&amp;#39;ve got a specific Gene that doesn&amp;#39;t allow you to export liver fat out of your liver into your circulation I don&amp;#39;t know but that&amp;#39;s something for you to interrogate it&amp;#39;s but by and large I&amp;#39;m going to be following this up in detail after this call I&amp;#39;m conscious that I I I need to to I want I want to move on because I don&amp;#39;t want to I know you had limited time before you had to be back in clinic I&amp;#39;d love to talk for a minute before we talk about what we do like what are the symptoms um so let&amp;#39;s say that somebody&amp;#39;s listening to this and they&amp;#39;re like oh I&amp;#39;m um I wonder if I um if I do have diabetes what are the symptoms that I&amp;#39;m going to be experiencing that that are going to answer that question for me so most Pat most individuals who have type 2 diabetes who do move into their sugar levels going high generally have very vague symptoms and some lots are completely asymptomatic as or because that change has been so gradual that they haven&amp;#39;t so asymptomatic means they&amp;#39;re not aware of any symptoms at all yes yeah the symptoms come generally when the sugar levels go really high at that point when the sugar goes very high the kidney&amp;#39;s ability to to to uh reabsorb that Sugar it gets diminished and you you push more sugar out into your your urine sugar cannot go on its own it has to carry water with it so you tend to pee a lot pee more during the day pee more during the night so-called polyurea you may then get more infections because you&amp;#39;ve got higher sugar levels as well you tend to f tired and fatigued partly because if you&amp;#39;re starting to pee out sugar your body&amp;#39;s efficiency and how it uses the sugar for optimal function is diminished so you&amp;#39;re fatigued so fatigue uh more infections um passing out more urine other kind of major you know kind of symptoms and it sounds like those symptoms you&amp;#39;re describing they aren&amp;#39;t when you first it&amp;#39;s not like when you get a cold or something you don&amp;#39;t get these symptoms when you first get pre-diabetes or even diabetes this is is like when it&amp;#39;s already lived with it yeah exactly you know the sugar levels are going up relatively slowly and it&amp;#39;s you know and so most people generally don&amp;#39;t you know maybe they have some vague feeling of I&amp;#39;m don&amp;#39;t have as much energy as they used to I&amp;#39;m sleeping a bit more erratically and just you know vague symptoms and and some may not it depends how how fast that sugar level is rising it depends over what period it&amp;#39;s rising it depends what age you are we know that younger people develop diabetes the sugar levels Rises faster than older people also excess weight is a much bigger factor in younger people develop diabetes and older people so there&amp;#39;s lots of different dimensions the thing I would say we did a study of 100 Asian men and and and and and white men of those 100 Asians 13 had diabetes and didn&amp;#39;t know about it okay didn&amp;#39;t know they had diabetes so you had a 100 Asians that you studied none of them thought they had diabetes none of them thought knew they had and 13 one in 13 turned out yeah so that&amp;#39;s huge 13% had this and they had no idea that they had this serious disease exactly yeah yeah so that&amp;#39;s I think everybody list to this is now are going to be a little bit scared if they haven&amp;#39;t like spoken to somebody is it all right if you think you have some concern so maybe I think you&amp;#39;re describing some of the reasons like you think maybe you have put on more weight around your tummy and you well it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s more than that Jonathan yeah so the things you should do there are simple scores you can look up you know what is my risk for diabetes High lower medium you know and you can do that this what&amp;#39;s this this this the the diabetes UK risk score which you can get online there&amp;#39;s the leester diabetes score there&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s known as Q diabetes online and the the the risk scores capture your age your family history of diabetes uh your ethnicity whether you&amp;#39;re a male or female U and your and generally your weight and and a couple few other things and they will give you an idea and it may be when you put that risk or it comes up for the vast majority is going to be actually low which case don&amp;#39;t worry about it it&amp;#39;s very unlikely you have diabetes if it comes up medium or high then at that point you might want to reach out to your GP and say look I&amp;#39;ve done this score could you potentially do my hb1c test I would like to know and and just get anot as it were and that&amp;#39;s what we just just to make sure that makes sense to everybody not in the UK listening who may not know what anot is um what you&amp;#39;re saying is I think if I if I play that back right is firstly there&amp;#39;s a there&amp;#39;s a score and we will put a link in the show notes for anyone listening to this who can find the the right um way to score this for for their country which basically gives you an indication of your likelihood of risk and what you&amp;#39;re saying I think is if that risk is medium or high then don&amp;#39;t feel bad about going and speaking to your to your doctor your physician and that there is this very um is it a very difficult test to do to then find out this hba1c no it&amp;#39;s effectively it&amp;#39;s a uh it&amp;#39;s a blood test um that the GP you know or or the healthcare professional or can take um um or a flist can take any time of the day um and it gets costs about in in British terms one to2 pound you know it&amp;#39;s not very exp and probably a bit more expensive in the US and some other the places so it&amp;#39;s not very cheap it&amp;#39;s not very expensive the test always a lot more expensive in the US yes but we won&amp;#39;t go and discuss that right now that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s a completely different but anyway it&amp;#39;s relatively easy it&amp;#39;s done you know get the result within a day and it he comes up with the hog glob A1 test so and you wouldn&amp;#39;t be because I think sometimes people people say oh you know if you&amp;#39;re not really sick you shouldn&amp;#39;t you know are you just like creating all these people worrying for no reason are you go on the vast majority of listeners when they do this test the risk will come up as low okay the vast majority and then they&amp;#39;re reassured doesn&amp;#39;t mean to say they can you know they still have to everyone has to try and live the best life they can and enjoyable life in the way as well and um but as an example be somebody like myself I have a family of diabetes so I have number I have a risk factor I&amp;#39;m also getting older you know that in itself isn&amp;#39;t a risk factor but because I have a family history and I&amp;#39;m South Asian you know then that probably you motivate if I do my diabetes RIS it comes up as something like 15% chance over the next 10 years so it&amp;#39;s a one in six or seven chance that I would and I have had a hemoglobin A1 test done and it came back as it&amp;#39;s actually okay but it&amp;#39;s getting in you know it&amp;#39;s getting close to the pre-diabetes range which fits with my family history the reason I&amp;#39;ve I&amp;#39;ve kept kept it down because I&amp;#39;ve kept my muscle mass up you know my father and my mother both developed diabetes in their 40s and 50s you know what that is a brilliant transition Point um um because I&amp;#39;d love to to talk about like so what do you do you know to avoid getting hopefully diabetes pre-diabetes in in in the first place and it sounds n that you&amp;#39;re literally living this yourself so um I&amp;#39;m fascinated and you mentioned I wasn&amp;#39;t sure was was getting the dog part of this solution but tell me like I think you you&amp;#39;ve you&amp;#39;ve painted a pretty clear picture that you would really like to avoid this because of all the serious implications so if someone&amp;#39;s listening to this and they&amp;#39;re saying like they&amp;#39;d they want to make the right actions could you talk through I think based on your own research but also I think fascinating to hear what you&amp;#39;re doing yourself as as an expert I mean it&amp;#39;s not even my research I think it&amp;#39;s based on the kind of global evidence that we know from all randomized trials all the various studies and around the world you know the evidence based is the following is that if if you want to reduce your risk of diabetes the key aspects are keeping us healthy way as you possibly can so you know diet makes a big sense and you know and you probably all the listeners here are well tuned to that and keeping relatively Physically Active um and those are the two major things we cannot stop aging you know um the one thing I would also say and I think I&amp;#39;ve hinted at this Jonathan um I&amp;#39;m now 56 six um if I can delay developing diabetes till I&amp;#39;m 75 I&amp;#39;m far less worried because if I if my sugar level start to escape high level I then I don&amp;#39;t have many more years for that sugar to cause damage High sugars immediately do not cause damage it takes about you know 5 to 10 to 15 years and also the older you become to get diabetes the slower your sugar will Elevate because it&amp;#39;s less linked to weight gain the younger you develop diabetes it&amp;#39;s more toxic it&amp;#39;s a more toxic disease because sugar levels rise faster you tend to have to need more weight the reason you tend to need to have more weight to C to trigger diabetes because when you&amp;#39;re young you tend to have a bigger muscle because you&amp;#39;re young and your pancreas is healthier because you&amp;#39;re young so in other words to overcome those um you know your better buffering capacity because you&amp;#39;re younger you need to put on you need to stress the system more by putting more fat in the wrong places but that comes with all the other risk factors that means your risk is much higher yeah so you&amp;#39;re saying if I can hold it off till I&amp;#39;m 75 then at that point maybe you could start to eat the uh you could eat chocolate quason all day is that there&amp;#39;s re think but but but I know that the diabetes then is is you know but you&amp;#39;re less worried about the DI diabetes it&amp;#39;s because not going to it&amp;#39;s not going to massively impair my life expectancy if at all it&amp;#39;s not going to lead me to have raging eye or kidney disease or nerve disease if at all you know whereas so if if you&amp;#39;re in your 40s and 50s and you&amp;#39;re in pre-diabetes some small sustainable Lifest child changes that means that you either stay the same we put on a bit of muscle mass or else lose three or four kilograms and sustain that and and able to keep healthy with a little bit of activity to stop you putting on weight means that you will probably delay developing diabetes for five you know three four or five or 10 year you know up to 10 years some people can delay this for a long time or even revert back to normal sugar levels so it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s effectively improving your muscle mass cutting your weight ectopic fat sufficient to dstress your glucose control mechanisms and nid could we talk a little bit about I I&amp;#39;d love to talk about what you&amp;#39;ve done yourself and you touched on it maybe briefly but I&amp;#39;d love to understand it sounds like this is a real live risk for you you describe the fact that like both your parents developed it um when they very young and it sounds like this is really on your and it just reminds me a little bit of Tim when he making his own changes for his health like it sounds like this is live for you what what have you how does it affect what you do um you know I&amp;#39;m obviously fortunate to live you know you know in an area with there&amp;#39;s an ability to do more physical activity I think the dog wasn&amp;#39;t an effort necessary to to keep my diabetes a we but the side product of the dog is that I am I&amp;#39;ve increased my walking much more than I ever did before and I enjoy it um I&amp;#39;ve now cycled to work for the last 10 years and I love it so what I&amp;#39;ve I&amp;#39;ve almost I&amp;#39;ve almost changed my own identity and Who I Am by becoming more physically active and finding things that I phys that really enjoy the side product of that is my muscle mass I can feel it has gone up uh I probably reduced a little bit of excess fat within my liver 25 years ago I was a bit heavier and one of my signals for diabetes was incredibly High and then you know and it&amp;#39;s come right down um because effectively it built more muscle got rid of some of that fat mass and some of those changes have been very gradual equally I&amp;#39;ve also made some diety changes as well you know cutting out some of the refined sugars increasing the variety of the foods I eat more fiber rich you know retrain my pallet to have different taste which takes a bit of time to get used to you know would you believe I even enjoy Shredded Wheat now you know I love Shredded Wheat but that&amp;#39;s taking me a few weeks to get used to that taste and texture but I love it okay add two or three grapes on it for a little bit of sweetness but that&amp;#39;s fine again so in a sense I&amp;#39;ve been on this gradual step by step by step journey to become a become eating a better quality fuel having a better quality activity that&amp;#39;s in a sense stopped me putting fat in the wrong places keep my engine better to stop me pushing into diabetes in my 40s or 50s and hopefully I can keep doing that by staying active to you know even if I get diabetes in my late 60s I&amp;#39;m not worried about it because we now have better I could undergo weight loss intervention I could go undergo this you know met forming there&amp;#39;s a some better drugs coming forward as well for someone who&amp;#39;s listening to this who already has you know type two diabetes or maybe they&amp;#39;ve been told they have pre-diabetes um is it possible to actually reverse some of this can you actually lower um the blood sugars that you were were were talking about yeah absolutely it&amp;#39;s so in every individual um we all have a different slope between weight gain and the hog globin the hb1c level so in a sense there&amp;#39;s almost a straight line between it each of us and my line is steeper than yours Jonathan because of my family history so for a smaller amount of weight gain my HBA want will Elevate because I&amp;#39;ll put fat in the wrong places and you know so we&amp;#39;ve shown in the direct trial that if you have a person who&amp;#39;s developed diabetes with the last 3 to 4 years if they lose 10 kilg about 46% after 1 year or 33% after 2 years no longer have diabetes because they&amp;#39;ve got rid of fat the liver fat comes right down then the liver responds far better to insulin that the liver makes less sugar your sugar normalizes in lot so so there&amp;#39;s a straight line between how much weight people lose and how what well their HB once he improves by and large and and it works the other way as well there&amp;#39;s a straight line between how much weight you put on and he just that slope of that line is different for different individuals based on whether you&amp;#39;re male or female South Asian or or or or white and wherever age you&amp;#39;re at and so on and so on and so that that does mean you know wherever you are there is something you can do and it&amp;#39;s not just absolutely so I had a patient this morning um in the clinic who has diabetes who&amp;#39;d undergone surgery for weight loss they&amp;#39;d lost a lot of weight that sugar levels had plummeted you know they&amp;#39;re still within the diabetes range and the thing I discussed with them was and they they was starting to worry about Mobility was can you actually now increase your muscle mass you&amp;#39;ve done you&amp;#39;ve lost and they had lost seven Stone because of surgery but clearly they could but they could do some resistance exercise a bit more physical activity to improve the mobility so to improve the engine side of it so everyone listening can do something but what they need to do is find something that they can sustain or enjoy to reinvent a new version of themselves that they enjoy and they can sustain for Better Health as well whether that&amp;#39;s dietry physical better sleep all the things that you&amp;#39;ve discussed in Zoe in various you know podcasts um you know better sleep gives you better appetite allows you to control your appetite better Mo you know destress maybe more physical activity all those things and trying do it in a way that either small steps that you can get to um slightly better health to to keep some of these diseases away and also to increase the life expectancy of healthy life as it were and contract it unhealthy life for later years which I think everyone listening to this podcast is interested in can I ask one final question before we then get to like the the summary um there are some new drugs that have been in the news like a zenic and there&amp;#39;s been a lot of discussion um we&amp;#39;re really lucky to speak to somebody who&amp;#39;s one of the world&amp;#39;s experts on Diabetes what&amp;#39;s your view about these so now you know in some respects I wish we would didn&amp;#39;t need to have those tools you know um because I wish we could change the environment make it easier for people to leave easier lives because it&amp;#39;s not easy changing your diet it&amp;#39;s not easy becoming more physically active you know we talked about it and and we have to overcome weight stigma we have to talk about helping people navigate the environment that they live in if you get if you&amp;#39;re surrounded by or food it&amp;#39;s very hard yeah it&amp;#39;s almost impossible I I so you know I don&amp;#39;t want people to think that I think it&amp;#39;s easy it&amp;#39;s not easy you know some of the changes that we&amp;#39;ve all had to make we&amp;#39;ve had to work at them but even then for a lot of people willpower is not enough the environment live is not enough so I wish we having several of that there&amp;#39;s millions of people living with um obesity and chronic diseases these drugs are good powerful tools that help people control their appetite um lose quite considerable amount of weight and therefore reduce and improve and you reduce the risk of a number of chronic diseases not only diabetes but more recently you reduce the risk of heart attacks or Strokes improve um symptoms and heart feel reduce the risk of kidney disease improve the quality of life so I&amp;#39;m GL glad they&amp;#39;re there they&amp;#39;re expensive we don&amp;#39;t have great availability so we need to work out in all Healthcare Systems how do we get them to the people who need them the most to get the maximum benefit from those individuals and society and that&amp;#39;s a big ask and hopefully over the next 10 years we&amp;#39;ll have more of those tools the prices will come down they&amp;#39;ll be proven to be long-term safe and the benefits outwear any potential risks but it sounds like you are expecting to be prescribing these to some people I&amp;#39;ve already prescribed them to some people because we have to but we need to do both prevention and treatment we can&amp;#39;t do just one and uh that is a whole another podcast that I would like to get you back it is na I would love to do a wrap up and for you to make sure whether I&amp;#39;ve got this right before you shoot Off to See Another patient if if that&amp;#39;s right sure so um I think we started by talking about like why would you worry about blood sugar at all and you you get this brilliant analogy of like sort of spilling sugar on the table and getting it wet and um that that&amp;#39;s this sticky mess and you do not want that in uh in your blood vessels and what happens is if you lose this control over your blood sugar because for example you&amp;#39;re starting to get all this fat in your lier and your panc C all the rest of actually you&amp;#39;re getting this stickiness in these like little blood vessels and this is damaging your your eyes and your nerves and it doesn&amp;#39;t sound good so it&amp;#39;s very clear that we don&amp;#39;t want that and then the question is well why is this happening because it&amp;#39;s now happening where you know there&amp;#39;s a 100 million people with pre-diabetes according to CDC in the US and you know this this big increase and you&amp;#39;re saying like the biggest reason is we&amp;#39;re starting to get um number one that we&amp;#39;re getting fat stored in our organs in a way that is really bad for them and and didn&amp;#39;t really happen in the past and you particularly talked about it being in your liver and in your pancreas um and that interestingly one of the reasons why we see so much variation between the the risks of diabetes is that different people have very different likelihood to store excess weight in those places and so you describe that for example women before menopause are much lower risk for diabetes because they tend to store their weight in almost anywhere other than the liver but interestingly as as as a man you&amp;#39;re saying almost the first place that I&amp;#39;m going to store this excess weight and in my case in particular that&amp;#39;s obviously very true is like right in the liver and then it starts to cause all of these um problems that interestingly there are big ethnic differences and I think you described that sort of anyone who isn&amp;#39;t Caucasian I think you said actually has significantly higher risk and then there&amp;#39;s further differences between ethnicity that there is a uh there&amp;#39;s some online tools to look at this and we will share those links in the show notes so you can understand your own um risks which are averages because I think what we always we see with Zoe is there&amp;#39;s a lot of personal variation but this is a a free first step and that if it looks High you you should go to your doctor and check and then I think we talked about the fact that I think one of the things that&amp;#39;s quite scary about this is that many people feel no symptoms and so you can have diabetes for a long time and this damage is starting to happen and you just don&amp;#39;t even realize which is again a reason to really believe in preventive health care and then we talked about what to do um and I think the main answer is we you know for many people listening to this is do what nid has done so firstly get a dog um secondly cycle to work um so basically find ways to be more physically active you&amp;#39;re saying because it increases your muscles compared to just this very uh you know non-moving way we tend to be and try and figure out how to control your weight which you know is a topic we talk about a lot on other podcasts and we know is hard but fundamentally if your weight is just going up year after year after year then you you&amp;#39;ve got this this problem um so physically active healthy weight so the right health um uh diet and a lot of people need support in that obviously yeah K and Jonathan sorry absolutely um and you know we part of what we talk obviously a lot on the podcast is is about this and and of course we uh we want people ultimately to decide they&amp;#39;d like to try the like the personalized program that&amp;#39;s really focused for them which which we talk about and I thought one thing you said that was really interesting is in your minds I actually what you want to do is delay diabetes in your perspective if you got diabetes when you&amp;#39;re 75 you&amp;#39;re actually not too stressed about it because it takes quite a long time for there to be damaged to you so it&amp;#39;s not like having a heart attack when you get diabetes it&amp;#39;s more like a risk and so you&amp;#39;re saying um you want to push that out because actually if you know maybe you&amp;#39;re quite high risk if you could push it out till 75 you&amp;#39;re going to be okay and then the final thing you said which I thought was really positive is you can reverse diabetes right it&amp;#39;s not like having cancer or a heart attack like it&amp;#39;s not a one-way Street actually by removing this fat out of your your liver you can actually get to the point where you don&amp;#39;t have diabetes or PRI pre-diabetes and I thought that was a a beautiful positive way to wrap it up perfect that&amp;#39;s a fantastic summary Jonathan y nid thank you so much I know that we like jumped over a lot of this this very big topic and I know you&amp;#39;re doing a lot of research in these these areas uh I hope that I can I can tempt you back in the future and and we can delighted yeah absolutely particularly whatever the feedback to try and unpick some of the other you know because obviously it&amp;#39;s hard to go into VAR specifics there are some variations in various things but I&amp;#39;ve given you the broad picture for the vast majority people in terms of type two we would love to do that and we&amp;#39;ll talk a lot more about the diet side of it as well of course there been Zoe n thank you so so much for taking the time

you&amp;#39;re going to give me a positive adjective is it like a describing one exactly okay are you ready to play the game yeah yeah i&amp;#39;m going to read you the story and you created this story because you gave me those things okay once upon a time there was a piggy named nia who lived in holmesburg every day at school mia would ask their teacher miss giraffe to go to the bathroom remember miss giraffe yes yeah this wasn&amp;#39;t just once a day though as nia would have to go every 30 minutes to the bathroom taking them away from painting building volcanoes and even reading ms giraffe thought this was strange so she told nia&amp;#39;s mom and suggested that she&amp;#39;d take nia to the best doctor in homestead holmesburg what&amp;#39;d i say homestead homestead do you know who the best doctor is in holmesburg document nope dr cockroach so nia goes to dr cockroach&amp;#39;s office neo walks into the examination room and it smelled like rotten kiwis and broken shavers yeah and that turns out because dr cockroach had just eaten lunch dr cockroach examined mia&amp;#39;s liver but that was healthy then dr cockroach used a stethoscope just like this and listened to mia&amp;#39;s heart but that was healthy too finally dr cockroach performed a blood test so as dr cockroach is performing the blood test nia was waiting for the results and she felt very nervous nia dreamed one day of becoming a plumber would being sick prevent them from doing that would they be lonely and spend their entire life at home watching the thundermans well finally dr cockroach returned with the blood test results dr cockroach told nia that she had type 1 diabetes you heard of that yeah yeah so immediately nia began to run because they were so mad does this mean i will never grow up to be a plumber ask nia not at all said dr cockroach people with type 1 diabetes actually live entirely normal and successful lives they grow up to be doctors photographers and if they&amp;#39;re lucky even youtubers yes is this because of all the cheese pizza i&amp;#39;ve been eating as nia not at all replied dr cockroach type 1 diabetes is not your fault it may cause you to feel thirsty use the bathroom often which would explain why you have to leave class so much it can give you headaches and you can make your breath even smell like watermelons what yeah type 1 diabetes is a lifelong illness which means there is no cure but it can be controlled you&amp;#39;ll need to check your blood sugar levels and make sure they don&amp;#39;t get too high or too low and all that being said if you monitor those levels and take care of your body you can live a long hairy life and become a plumber [Music] do you know what type 1 diabetes is now you&amp;#39;re born diabetes yeah and it&amp;#39;s not your problem but you have to keep your blood pressure not too high i mean your um your weather sugar sugar but you&amp;#39;re right too the blood pressure too it&amp;#39;s important yeah and not too high but not too low and number two is when you get it when you eat too much sweets and you get it well sometimes that can happen but type 1 diabetes means you&amp;#39;re born with it type 2 means you develop it in your life do you know what&amp;#39;s the hormone that you need to function in order for your blood levels to be normal blood sugar levels medicine someone said it behind you insulin yes okay so there&amp;#39;s an organ inside your abdomen here it&amp;#39;s called a pancreas a pancreas yeah it sounds funny right like a penguin yes and it makes insulin and what that insulin does is it allows the sugar to go into your cells so you can be healthy and strong and insulin is made by pang gwins pancreas i think you guys figured it out you&amp;#39;re basically doctors though do you have any questions about type 1 diabetes will we ever find a cure for diabetes um i think in the future we might right now we don&amp;#39;t have one but we have a way to treat it to keep you healthy and happy does it hot diabetes does it hot it can make your stomach hurt sometimes make your belly hurt on its own if you manage it well it&amp;#39;s okay it doesn&amp;#39;t hurt and if you have to give yourself insulin it&amp;#39;s a little prick but it doesn&amp;#39;t hurt that much do a lot of kids have diabetes across the world yes it&amp;#39;s a very common condition thousands if not millions of kids around the world have diabetes more than that yeah because there&amp;#39;s a lot of people there&amp;#39;s a lot of people good job all right we learned about type 1 diabetes and the liver and then and this and then you have to do the explosion oh you added it exploded that was it check out this video where we watch doc mcstuffins and check out the video on their channel people people people people you you you u u [Music]",

    "transcript": "Diabetes is a condition where your blood glucose \nlevel also known as blood sugar level is too high.   There are two main types of diabetes: Type 1 \nand Type 2. There are also some rarer types   but they&amp;#39;re all serious and can be diagnosed \nby your GP. The signs and symptoms you need to   look out for are: weeing often, because your body \nwill be trying to lower your blood sugar levels   by flushing out the extra sugar in your blood. \nThis can lead to other symptoms including   feeling really thirsty or genital itching and \nthrush. This can happen if your wee contains a   lot of sugar from your blood because it can \ncreate an environment for fungal infections.   You may also feel tired because the sugar \nin your blood can&amp;#39;t get into your cells to   turn into energy this could lead to your body \ntrying to break down its fat stores instead. So you might find that you are losing \nweight without really trying to. Wounds might also take longer to heal because high \nblood sugar levels can limit nutrients and oxygen   from getting to your wound. And your eyesight might \nbe blurry as blood sugar can build up making it   harder to see. With type 1 diabetes, the symptoms \ncan be more obvious and develop much quicker.   Over a few days or weeks. With type 2 diabetes, the \nsymptoms can develop much slower and some people   may not have any symptoms. This is why \nsome people can live with type 2 for years   without realizing they have it. If you do notice \nany of the symptoms contact your GP straight away.   Getting diagnosed can be the \nfirst step to getting treatment   and support so that you can find ways to \nlive well with diabetes as soon as possible.",

    "transcript": "type 2 diabetes and pre-diabetes are conditions that affect millions of people they can lead to heart disease and stroke which are the first and third leading causes of death and disability in the united states respectively people with diabetes and pre-diabetes can develop problems with their vision and lose feeling in their limbs they may develop liver and kidney disease and are at risk for stroke and heart attack however type 2 diabetes and pre-diabetes can be avoided and risk can be reversed what is diabetes diabetes is a complex disease that affects many parts of your body but is caused by the way your body mishandles the food you eat after a meal food is broken down into sugar molecules called glucose glucose travels through the intestines into the blood where it is carried to all different areas of the body and is used for energy there are some parts of your body that need help absorbing the glucose molecules and require a special hormone called insulin insulin is formed in the pancreas and circulates in the blood with glucose to the cells that need help specifically liver cells fat cells and muscle cells when the body develops resistance to insulin increasing amounts of insulin are necessary for it to be able to utilize glucose initially during insulin resistance your pancreas will work on overtime to produce more insulin this can happen even when your glucose levels are relatively normal if tests reveal abnormally high insulin levels a condition called hyperinsulinemia along with insulin resistance markers your body shows initial risk for developing diabetes lots of insulin in the blood also affects the production of lipids and lipoproteins which are the small particles that are broken down from cholesterol molecules and fat products called triglycerides these particles are small enough to travel in your bloodstream but can be dangerous in large amounts when they build up in your blood vessels in the presence of elevated levels of insulin your body especially your liver releases bad cholesterol particles such as vldl and the higher your insulin levels the more bad cholesterol particles are circulating in your bloodstream a condition called dyslipidemia furthermore adiponectin a hormone released by your fat cells that helps break down lipids in particular free fatty acids is often low in obese or insulin resistant patients prior to developing type 2 diabetes while such lipid and lipoprotein markers are traditionally tested to measure cholesterol they also provide insightful clues on the extent of insulin resistance after a while the pancreas will become overworked and the special beta cells that produce insulin will begin to die some tests will measure how well your beta cells function and if they are showing strain beta cell dysfunction means that your body can no longer make enough insulin to help your cells take up glucose for energy and high levels of glucose will remain in your blood a condition called hyperglycemia when insulin levels are low your body may react in a number of ways some of the cells that use insulin to control glucose levels have the ability to store glucose liver and muscle cells will begin to release stored glucose when insulin levels are low in order to provide the body energy without adequate levels of insulin in the presence of insulin resistance more and more glucose is released into the bloodstream and the effects of hyperglycemia are heightened markers of glycemic control are usually measured during periods of fasting when your blood sugar should be low test results that demonstrate consistently high glucose levels are the defining characteristic of pre-diabetes and diabetes to summarize how diabetes develops let&amp;#39;s review the main features high insulin levels mark the beginning of insulin resistance the primary mechanism that leads to pre-diabetes and diabetes abnormal levels of lipids lipoproteins and the hormone adiponectin may further indicate insulin resistance a drop in insulin production by the pancreas occurs from strain on the hormone-producing beta cells and beta cell dysfunction eventually leads to an insulin deficiency without adequate levels of insulin your body&amp;#39;s ability to control glucose levels is disrupted and glucose levels increase defining the onset of prediabetes and diabetes too much glucose circulating in your blood hyperglycemia and too many harmful lipids circulating in your blood dyslipidemia are two conditions that are characteristic of prediabetes and diabetes left untreated they cause serious damage to the blood vessels leading to a variety of complications excess levels of lipids and lipoprotein particles can build up to create a plaque in your blood vessels this is heightened in the presence of excess glucose molecules and free fatty acids due to blockage in your vessels blood cannot circulate to your limbs and the nutrients and oxygen carried by your blood cannot nourish your body&amp;#39;s extremities build up causes the vessels to expand and squeeze the nerves that course alongside them leading to a condition called neuropathy damaged nerves can cause numbness and keep you from healing normally they can cause your muscles to weaken and eventually atrophy sometimes requiring amputation and you may experience sensory changes including blindness involuntary functions such as blood pressure and heart rate and even sexual function may become abnormal as a symptom of neuropathy in large vessels like those supplying your heart and your brain plaque buildup leads to a condition called atherosclerosis over time the plaque can grow and rupture which can cause cardiovascular disease or a heart attack or in the brain can lead to a stroke atherosclerosis further contributes to end-organ damage like kidney or liver disease [Music] you",

diabetic diet we&amp;#39;re gonna cover every inch of the grocery store from fresh produce meat the middle aisles dairy all the good stuff so i show you the best quality items and products to put in your body when you&amp;#39;re on a low sugar low carb diabetic diet you don&amp;#39;t have to sacrifice quality you don&amp;#39;t have to sacrifice flavor anymore because there&amp;#39;s some next level products upstairs but i&amp;#39;m going to show you what to buy what to avoid and why in detail before we get rocking and rolling you know the drill like subscribe share all those things are lovely but right below the video is a bell you&amp;#39;re going to want to enable all notifications on my channel because every single week we have like six videos going live three videos three live cooking streams where we make a recipe from start to finish it&amp;#39;s a lot of fun all right let&amp;#39;s mask up let&amp;#39;s go shopping and do our thing let&amp;#39;s navigate our way through the produce section and find the best veggies and fruits for a diabetic diet i love this fruit and veggie section here at whole foods it&amp;#39;s just so colorful really makes me happy what makes me happy also is avocados avocados are a very fiber-rich food they also have a lot of yummy fat really really good fat for you and what do we talk about foods that are high in fiber are prebiotics they&amp;#39;re very good for the tummy bacteria avocados are fantastic for a diabetic and a keto diet it&amp;#39;s actually one of the most fiber rich foods here in the produce section but probably the most fiber rich food in the produce section is right here it&amp;#39;s the artichoke the artistry just looks like it has a lot of fiber it looks like something that&amp;#39;s going to be a colon cleanser goes through your system just getting all the stuff out of there and pushing it through the thing is it&amp;#39;s very hard to prepare this and it&amp;#39;s kind of a pain in the butt because all these leaves on the outside are inedible you have to shave it down to get to the heart and then steam it or boil it the thing is if we go to the middle aisle section i bet we can find a much easier more consumer-friendly version of the artichoke let&amp;#39;s go over there really quick there we go this is what i was talking about these are artichoke hearts usually baby artichoke hearts in water or in oil all of that hard work has been done for you so it&amp;#39;s much easier to consume and these are just artichokes with water sea salt and a little bit of citric acid as the preservative that&amp;#39;s totally fine but look at this we&amp;#39;re talking about three grams of fiber for a one serving size is one jar very very nice the thing is careful when they&amp;#39;re marinated and put in oil if the oil is not olive oil or extra virgin olive oil run forest run why because this one here let&amp;#39;s see is packed in sunflower oil sunflower oil like we talked about is inflammatory highly processed plant-based oil plant-based oils that are processed spike your cholesterol people with diabetes oftentimes have high cholesterol so if you can&amp;#39;t find it with uh extra virgin olive oil or olive oil just go for the ones packed in water you&amp;#39;re good to go let me check the fiber on this one this one has four grams of fiber for three pieces yeah that seems higher for some reason this one seemed low very very fiber rich food we&amp;#39;re officially going to call uh artichokes the colon blow of the fruit and vegetable section this stuff is dynamite green leafy vegetables are your friend they&amp;#39;re generally low in carbs and they&amp;#39;re very high in fiber one of my favorites is kale well they don&amp;#39;t have it today i usually stay away from the green curly kale because it&amp;#39;s a little too fibrous and rubbery the lacinato kale is a little bit better but you always want to get organic kale that&amp;#39;s on the dirty dozen spinach is always on the dirty dozen but you want to get organic but it&amp;#39;s very high in fiber all lettuces to be honest when you get romaine red leaf lettuce what&amp;#39;s that over there a little bit of escarole always get those organic because they tend to be high in pesticides and chemicals one vegetable that&amp;#39;s very high in fiber and low carb is broccoli but you don&amp;#39;t have to get organic broccoli broccoli has a natural compound in it that prevents bugs and insects from attacking it so they spray it less you can actually get conventional broccoli you can get conventional cabbage you don&amp;#39;t have to splurge for organic and that&amp;#39;s loaded with fiber another gut friendly food cauliflower just like broccoli has that natural compound in there you don&amp;#39;t have to get organic fantastic for making a rice substitute you just want to stay away from the starchy vegetables like your butternut squashes like the potatoes over there sweet potatoes all that stuff all the yams asparagus asparagus is fantastic and you don&amp;#39;t have to get organic asparagus either because you usually shave away the bottoms of the stalks here and that&amp;#39;s where any of the chemicals would live so no need to splurge for that don&amp;#39;t have to get organic brussels sprouts which are high in fiber too they have that natural compound just like the cabbage does so there&amp;#39;s really a lot of options here and once you know what to get organic and not to get organic which is very important but the dirty dozen ones are very very dirty you&amp;#39;re home free would you ever think that chocolate can be part of a diabetic&amp;#39;s diet and the answer is yes because dark chocolate is actually high in fiber antioxidants and a bunch of other good nutrients but not all dark chocolate is created equally so look at this this is organic dark chocolate it says 57 cocoa the thing is i believe that to be legally called dark chocolate it has to have a minimum of 55 cocoa so this is barely there so the only issue with this is we look at what&amp;#39;s going on here and per serving there&amp;#39;s still 14 grams of added sugar now listen when you&amp;#39;re on a diabetic diet 14 grams of added sugar is too much so even though it&amp;#39;s technically dark chocolate i would go for a higher cocoa percentage we come down here here we go 68 that&amp;#39;s a little bit better and it has almonds which are high in fiber too look what happens the sugar goes down a little bit not as much as i&amp;#39;d want to see because still 68 is good but i think we can do better what kind of better there we go look at this 85 exquisitely rich dark chocolate look what happens to the sugar boom goes the dynamite down to four grams of added sugar and four grams of fiber which is fantastic for a three serving bar that is really really good stuff now if you want to avoid sugar altogether we live in a new uh century that has some really really exciting stuff such as this this is keto nut butter chocolate bars this is crazy because number one it&amp;#39;s tasty i have this at home right now number two number two it&amp;#39;s open already so don&amp;#39;t buy this one exactly but look what&amp;#39;s going on here we have five grams of fiber and zero grams of added sugar how do you do that well look at these next level ingredients first of all everything&amp;#39;s organic they&amp;#39;re adding a little bit of jerusalem artichoke fiber there which is great because it jacks up the fiber and they&amp;#39;re sweetening it with monk fruit extract this stuff is literally delicious and maybe one of the most healthy nutrient-dense keto chocolates on the market so that&amp;#39;s great once again not that one if you want something a little different here go for lily&amp;#39;s sugar-free dark chocolate so check this out this is extra dark sweetened with stevia so we look at the ingredients see that inulin right there inulin is a fiber supplement so that&amp;#39;s going to jack up the fiber and i don&amp;#39;t mind the soy lettuce lecithin that&amp;#39;s an emulsifier it&amp;#39;s non-gmo soy says it here somewhere there we go non-gmo soy very common in certain chocolates but zero grams of sugar 10 grams of fiber that&amp;#39;s amazing so you have some options if you want to avoid sugar completely if you want sugar just go for the highest percentage cocoa you can get and remember not all chocolate is the same look for the highest percentage of chocolate around but man oh man there&amp;#39;s some really exciting stuff in the chocolate world just because you&amp;#39;re diabetic you don&amp;#39;t have to cut it out if you&amp;#39;re going to eat pasta on a diabetic diet you really want to avoid the traditional enriched wheat pastas those are made with a white wheat flour that spike the crud out of your blood sugar and offer no nutrition you&amp;#39;re going to want to live in the alternative pasta section usually made of brown rice and legumes and stuff like that and you want to go you&amp;#39;re going to want to go with the most nutrient-dense high-fiber pasta on the market and that&amp;#39;s made from red lentils red lentils or chickpeas are just fantastic because you look at the macros look at that you guys protein off the charts but fiber a nine gram serving of fiber in a three ounce portion is fantastic and i believe the chickpea pasta should be the same yeah three ounces nine grams so why is that important well when you&amp;#39;re going to have carbs number one you do have to limit them but number two you want to one have ones that are made with whole grains like these because they&amp;#39;re not gonna spike your blood sugars nearly as much as the other pasta that being said let&amp;#39;s say you want pasta a really indulgent dish and you don&amp;#39;t want to spike your blood sugar at all well you still don&amp;#39;t want to eat these made from legumes there is one pasta that&amp;#39;s almost zero carbs has a ton of fiber and it lives in the refrigerated section let&amp;#39;s go check it out it&amp;#39;s one of my favorite all right here it is i know they always have it at whole foods and usually in walmart super centers it&amp;#39;s either in the produce section or right here in the vegan section and this is it it&amp;#39;s called pasta zero now there&amp;#39;s a lot of shirataki noodles on the market but i find that nasoya pasta zero is the best so what makes it so good well number one there&amp;#39;s spaghetti shapes or fettuccine but look at these macros okay there&amp;#39;s two servings in a bag to be honest it&amp;#39;s more like one serving but there&amp;#39;s two grams of net carbs times two servings there&amp;#39;s only four grams of neck carbs and a whopping six grams of fiber in this whole bag what&amp;#39;s so cool the ingredients are also clean as a whistle here it&amp;#39;s made with cone jack flour and something like this is also known as a prebiotic foods that are high in uh fiber are prebiotics and they feed your gut bacteria so in addition to not spiking your blood sugar it fosters good bacteria in your gut and i&amp;#39;m all about that i really believe the backbone to healthy living is a good gut bacteria and flora i use this a lot in my still number one best-selling keto meal prepping cookbook if you&amp;#39;re looking for diabetic friendly recipes and keto recipes i&amp;#39;ll put that link down below you guys still after 15 months now it&amp;#39;s a number one best seller on amazon all because of y&amp;#39;all and we have a bunch of really cool recipes using this and spaghetti squash that are great for diabetes and diabetic diets so look for these they&amp;#39;re a fantastic pasta substitute that won&amp;#39;t spike your blood sugar at all we have entered the breakfast aisle and they always say that you should eat whole grains that are really rich in fiber when you&amp;#39;re on a diabetic diet why is that because the fiber actually moves through your system very slowly and it prevents your blood sugars from spiking the thing is something like oatmeal still has a lot of carbs so i would really limit the amount of oatmeal in your diet if you&amp;#39;re going to eat oatmeal there&amp;#39;s a couple guidelines i like to follow number one don&amp;#39;t go for any flavored kinds because anytime you see something like maple pecan or any flavor that always means there&amp;#39;s added sugar and when you see eight grams of added sugar that&amp;#39;s two teaspoons of added cane sugar that is not good for you at all so always go for plain and then that brings me to point number two always look for if you can steel cut oats because a lot of people don&amp;#39;t realize steel cut oats compared to rolled oats have a little more fiber so this is the serving size for one serving of rolled oats has three grams of fiber and one serving of steel cut should be higher let&amp;#39;s see here yeah it has four grams so you&amp;#39;re probably going to want to get the quick cooking steel cut oats and please always get organic oats whether you do the rolled oats or the steel cuts see these aren&amp;#39;t organic what&amp;#39;s the problem with that well oats actually score high in glyphosate glyphosate is the active ingredient in roundup why the heck would roundup be sprayed on oats while they&amp;#39;re sprayed on oats because they&amp;#39;re used as a desiccant a drying agent to dry out the oats at the end of the growing process to make it easier and quicker to harvest because of that the glyphosate levels score high you don&amp;#39;t want that chunk in your body so go organic but if you&amp;#39;re going to eat oats i would supplement part of your oats with a low carb high fiber item like one of these chia seeds the miracle plant that grows or flax seeds these are amazing because in addition to being a low carb they&amp;#39;re loaded with fiber look at that six grams of fiber two grams of net carbs and a ton of protein so i would actually do maybe like half and half oatmeal and that or skip the oatmeal all together get chia seeds which have basically the same nutritional profile of the flax seeds make chia seed pudding i have recipes for dairy free chia seed pudding once again in my keto meal prepping cookbook and on my blog i&amp;#39;ll put links down below i can do a sugar-free keto chocolate chia seed pudding you can do a low glycemic blueberry chia seed pudding the point is you&amp;#39;re going to want to limit the whole grains supplement them with chia seeds and flax seeds and don&amp;#39;t add any sugar or any kind of inflammatory items to the oatmeal and you&amp;#39;re good to go this is actually my favorite section of the grocery store the cooking oils and fats aisle because there&amp;#39;s so many great fats and oils that didn&amp;#39;t used to be at the grocery store in the 80s and 90s and some of the best ones i think to cook with on a diabetic diet are grass-fed yeah all of these amazing pasture-raised and grass-fed animal fats like duck fat beef tallow pasture-raised pork fat virgin coconut oil is fantastic and avocado oil is another good one and then down here olive oil olive oil is great and a lot of people ask me one of the best ones to cook with and finish with at the grocery store and it&amp;#39;s actually this it&amp;#39;s a usa california based company called california olive ranch i&amp;#39;ve seen cheaper prices here and there but this is actually a cooking evoo and a finishing extra virgin olive oil i actually cook with extra virgin olive oil not like a top shelf bottle that costs a lot of money something like this or if you&amp;#39;re a costco member get the big organic kirkland uh extra virgin olive oil and cook with that and finish it if you want or just get a really good bottle of finishing oil like one of these like super small ones here something like this this would be something you wouldn&amp;#39;t want to cook with because it&amp;#39;s very expensive you want to finish with that so why are those good why is he talking about fats we&amp;#39;re not talking about uh cholesterol we&amp;#39;re talking about diabetes here that&amp;#39;s because if you cook with oils like canola oil sunflower oil soybean oil safflower oil stuff like these are actually very inflammatory why does that matter because inflammatory foods actually cause cholesterol cholesterol spikes people with diabetes oftentimes have high cholesterol so when you&amp;#39;re eating and using oils that have refined oils that are highly processed and highly inflammatory they&amp;#39;re gonna spike your cholesterol why is something like canola oil inflammatory that&amp;#39;s because it&amp;#39;s processed at such high heat and usually gmo if it&amp;#39;s not organic it&amp;#39;s inflammatory you don&amp;#39;t want that stuff in your body and conventional canola oil uses hexane the chemical to extract the oil from the plant making it inflammatory making it raise your cholesterol making it bad for diabetics so stick with the heart healthier oils the avocado oil the coconut oil ghee coconut oil is a good saturated fat don&amp;#39;t believe the hype that it&amp;#39;s bad for you and it makes your cholesterol go up it actually makes it go down it&amp;#39;s a very very special oil bottom line have inflam low inflammatory oils avoid the processed plant-based oils get the ones i just recommended i&amp;#39;ve talked about the benefits of a hundred percent grass-fed beef many many times grass-fed beef is not only better for the cow the farmer the environment and for you because the nutritional profile is better it&amp;#39;s also beneficial to a diabetic diet because when you see something that says 100 grass-fed or grass-fed and grass finish it has to say one of those two things otherwise it could be finished on grain if it only says grass-fed it has more conjugated linoleic acids those are actually a very beneficial compound that&amp;#39;s good for people with diabetes so when you&amp;#39;re at the grocery store just look for it i always get the higher fat percentage this is 85 beef to 15 fat and it&amp;#39;s a little cheaper than the lean what is this 95 7. you&amp;#39;re probably going to overcook that and like i said the fat in here is healthy it&amp;#39;s actually good for you because it&amp;#39;s pasteurized never eaten grain why is that better than something that&amp;#39;s grain fed because when you have traditional ground beef that&amp;#39;s grain fed they&amp;#39;re eating gmo soy and corn those are inflammatory feed and because of that the nutritional profile of grain fed cattle is lower than grass fed it&amp;#39;s available everywhere now you can get it even for way better prices than this for many reasons including diabetes purposes go for grass-fed ground beef it doesn&amp;#39;t have to be organic necessarily it just has to say 100 grass-fed or grass-fed and grass finish way better than corn fed grain fed gmo beef yogurt is something that&amp;#39;s very very tricky because there&amp;#39;s hidden sugars lurking in 99 of the yogurts on the market so obviously you want to get plain unsweetened but that also applies to simple things like vanilla when you see something like vanilla at the grocery store it doesn&amp;#39;t mean it doesn&amp;#39;t have sugar look at this this is organic which is great for yogurt vanilla you guys that&amp;#39;s 16 grams of sugar for a three-quarter cup serving 16 grams of sugar is four teaspoons four teaspoons of cane sugar in one serving so you have to go plain organic is good but you could actually do better so what does that mean well here&amp;#39;s a greek style plane that&amp;#39;s actually even better because what happens when something is greek style it&amp;#39;s strained what happens when you strain yogurt well number one you intensify the protein but number two you remove the lactose what lives in the lactose the sugar so greek yogurt is inherently lower in sugar but this is not oh it is organic but we can do better how can we do better that sounds too good to be true it&amp;#39;s down here this is by far what i think the best yogurt on the market it&amp;#39;s not only organic it&amp;#39;s not only greek style it&amp;#39;s a hundred percent grass-fed grass-fed dairy has the highest nutritional profile of any other dairy on the market because they&amp;#39;re eating grass higher clas higher omega-3 fatty acids and it&amp;#39;s whole milk yogurt whole milk yogurt is going to have lower sugar so because it&amp;#39;s strained and greek style look at this the total sugar here is five grams per three-quarter cup that&amp;#39;s five grams of natural sugar if it were unstrained it&amp;#39;d have maybe seven or eight so lower sugar plus all those beneficial fatty acids in the saturated fat and greek you can&amp;#39;t always get this at every grocery store if you can&amp;#39;t get it just get organic greek style whole milk yogurt but i would honestly take a trip to somewhere like a whole foods that has this because it&amp;#39;s worth it now what if you&amp;#39;re dairy free like me and you want your low carb sugar-free fix these guys got you covered kite hill makes a greek style almond-based yogurt that is so good and good for you so look at this first of all fiber&amp;#39;s off the charts five grams of fiber per serving and three grams of natural sugar and 13 grams of protein how do they do that they do it by here we go this is how they do it it&amp;#39;s strained and has 13 grams of almond protein isolate in there so really really good stuff if you&amp;#39;re dairy free or if you want uh dairy just avoid the sugar go greek style go organic or grass-fed when you can i think most everyone on a diabetic diet knows you have to avoid traditional sodas because the sugars can be astronomical but when this video is done i want you to watch the video from yesterday when i talked about the worst artificial sweeteners on the market so if you have diabetes and you&amp;#39;re drinking diet pepsi and diet coke i want you to stop because of instead of adding sugar they&amp;#39;re adding aspartame and sucralose or splenda and those are devastating artificial sweeteners that are so bad for your health your brain your gut so avoid those and go for something like stevia sweetened soda these guys are available everywhere they have all these different flavors here i would avoid any of the ones that have caramel coloring because caramel coloring is a known carcinogen stick with the regular soda here and it&amp;#39;s sweetened with stevia and it has natural flavors they all have natural flavors you can&amp;#39;t avoid it i&amp;#39;d rather you have natural flavors than fake sugar that&amp;#39;s really devastating for your health stevia is not now don&amp;#39;t think that you can have something like this because this is izzy and it&amp;#39;s not sweetened with any sugar you see zero grams of added sugar but it&amp;#39;s sweetened with fruit juice concentrate 27 grams of sugar is still 27 grams of sugar how much is 27 grams of sugar it&amp;#39;s over six teaspoons so even though it&amp;#39;s fruit juice concentrate it&amp;#39;s still gonna spike your blood sugar so i would avoid something like this go for the zero calorie zero carb stevia sweetened sodas that&amp;#39;s really what you want and as long as you&amp;#39;re in the snack food aisle here what&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s some of the best snack foods for a diabetic diet it&amp;#39;s going to be chicharrones why well first of all they&amp;#39;re darn delicious they&amp;#39;re crispy fatty and salty but look at this zero carbs that&amp;#39;s amazing and they&amp;#39;re actually not as high in fat as you think there&amp;#39;s five grams or five servings in here at four and a half grams of fat per that&amp;#39;s just over 20 grams of fat but there&amp;#39;s no carbs there&amp;#39;s no starch any of the chicharrones that don&amp;#39;t have added sugar like you probably don&amp;#39;t want the dessert ones are going to be good to go and then i know a lot of people ask me about these these are chicken chips so on the surface they should be diabetic friendly but if i look at the carbs here there&amp;#39;s nine grams of carbs per serving two servings per bag 18 grams of carbs where is that coming from this is chicken well it&amp;#39;s coming from the tapioca flour they&amp;#39;re covered in tapioca flour but also look at this they&amp;#39;re fried or baked in sunflower oil and they have maltodextrin maltodextrin also is high on the glycemic index it comes from gmo corn so keep that in mind when you&amp;#39;re looking at packages and it&amp;#39;s not a in my opinion high quality oil it&amp;#39;s expeller pressed higher leg sunflower oil it&amp;#39;s still a processed plant-based oil it is better when it&amp;#39;s expeller pressed but processed plant-based oils like this are going to be inflammatory the maltodextrin is going to be inflammatory and the tapioca starch makes it high in carbs so it&amp;#39;s not really a diabetic friendly chip although you think it might be i stick with the chicharrones wash it down with some of that xevia you&amp;#39;re good to go all right y&amp;#39;all that is it i got my groceries for the weekend i&amp;#39;m good to go that was nice right there&amp;#39;s a lot of really top quality products and ingredients in the grocery store that are not only low carb low sugar diabetic friendly but they have best in class ingredients you don&amp;#39;t have to sacrifice flavor or quality just because you&amp;#39;re on the diabetic diet if you

    "transcript": "hey everyone in this video i will tell you about early signs and symptoms of diabetes mellitus before we begin let me tell you there are mainly three types of diabetes mellitus type 1 here insulin is completely absent type 2 where either insulin formation decreases or the body is not responding to the insulin formed third one is gestational diabetes the gestational diabetes develops in pregnant women who have never had diabetes in this video i will tell you about the first two types of diabetes that is type 1 and type 2 diabetes which are the most common forms so how can you tell if you have diabetes mellitus from here on instead of saying diabetes mellitus i will just say diabetes the most early symptoms are from higher than normal levels of glucose and glucose is a kind of sugar in your blood both type 1 and type 2 diabetes have some of these same tell-tale warning signs so they share their warning signs though these warning signs may be mild especially in case of type 2 diabetes and it may even go unnoticed while in case of type 1 diabetes the symptoms usually occur early and are much more severe than type 2 let&amp;#39;s now take a look at the early signs of diabetes first one hunger and fatigue the food that we eat is converted into glucose and this glucose is utilized by our cells for energy but our cells need insulin to take in glucose and if the body doesn&amp;#39;t make enough or any insulin or if the cells are resistant to insulin then this glucose can&amp;#39;t get into them and you have no energy this can make you even more hungrier and more tired than usual second sign is peeing more often and being thirstier a person with diabetes may need to pee a lot more than an average person normally your body reabsorbs glucose as it passes through the kidney but when the blood sugar goes up as in the case of diabetes the kidneys may not be able to bring it all back in and this causes the body to make more urine and this takes more fluid so this will make you very thirsty and you will drink more water so when you drink more water you will also pee more third is dry mouth and itchy skin because the body is using a lot of fluid to make urine there&amp;#39;s less moisture available for other things and this can make you dehydrated and your mouth may feel dry and dry skin can make you itchy fourth is blurred vision the changing fluid levels in the body can make the lens in the eye swell up and since the lenses change shape and can&amp;#39;t focus properly our vision is blurred let&amp;#39;s now take a look at the symptoms of diabetes the symptoms appear after the glucose level is high for a long time the symptoms include fungal or yeast infection the fungal infection may be seen in both men and women that are suffering with diabetes the excess glucose in your body promotes this fungal infection and these infections can grow in any warm moist skin folds that include between finger and toes under the breasts in or around genital organs second slow healing source or cuts so over the time high blood sugar can affect the blood flow and it may even cause nerve damage so the affected blood flow and nerve damage makes it hard for your body to heal wounds then pain or numbness in feet or legs so the pain and numbness is also a result of nerve damage caused by high blood glucose next is unplanned weight loss if your body can&amp;#39;t get energy from the food that you consume then the body starts to burn muscle and fat because it requires energy and because it is burning muscles and fat this leads to unwanted weight loss next is nausea and vomiting now when the body burns fat it makes ketones these ketones can build up in blood to dangerous levels when the body keeps on making ketones and these ketones can make you feel sick so it is the ketone accumulation that causes the feeling of nausea and vomiting now diabetes is a disease that can lead to certain complications and the science which can act as a warning for these complications include first slow healing source or cuts second itchy skin usually it is around the vaginal or growing area third frequent yeast infection or you can say frequent fungal infection then recent weight loss velvety dark skin changes of the neck armpit and growing area which is called acanthosis nigricans numbness and tingling of the hands and feet decreased vision impotence or erectile dysfunction a serious complication of prolonged increase in blood glucose is diabetic comma diabetic comma can even lead to death it may occur with either types of diabetes though it is more common in type 2 diabetes it happens when the blood sugar gets too high and your body gets severely dehydrated and its symptoms include first blood sugar above 600 milligram per deciliter dry parched mouth extreme thirst warm dry skin that doesn&amp;#39;t sweat you may even have a high fever sleepiness or confusion vision loss hallucinations and weakness on one side of your body so these are some warning signs that would indicate a pending diabetic comma so when do we visit a doctor or when should we consult a doctor if you are older than 45 or you have any other risk for diabetes it is important that you get tested when you spot the condition early you can avoid heart trouble nerve damage and various other complications so as a general rule consult your doctor if you feel very sick weak and very thirsty if you are peeing a lot if you have a bad belly ache if you are breathing more deeply and faster than usual if you have sweet breath that smells like nail polish remover see this sweet breath is a sign of very high ketones so it means that you have high ketone in your blood under these conditions it is important that you get yourself tested by a doctor so that&amp;#39;s all for now hope you like this video and if you do like this video do like comment and share this video thank you",

    "transcript": "can you drink alcohol if you have diabetes being diabetic and drinking alcohol can be a tricky situation you might want to know whether it&amp;#39;s safe to drink alcohol during diabetes and how much is okay to drink well you can still drink alcohol even if you have diabetes however it is very important to be aware of the effects that alcohol has on your body one alcohol even in small amount may cause blood sugar to rise this is because alcohol such as beer and wine has carbohydrates and sugar in them second consuming excess alcohol can actually decrease your blood sugar level sometimes even causing it to drop into dangerous levels moreover there are other health risks around drinking drinking excessively may lead to risk of getting cancer heart disease high blood pressure and even liver disease so while there is not a definite no it is important to remember if you have diabetes you should limit your intake of alcohol",

    "transcript": "a silent epidemic more than 1.3 billion people could be living with diabetes by 2050 and it&amp;#39;s being made worse by inequalities in healthcare and access to treatment so what&amp;#39;s accelerating the spread of this disease and what should be done to ensure adequate and fair medical help this is Inside Story [Music] hello and welcome to the program I&amp;#39;m fully batibo the number of adults living with diabetes worldwide will more than double by 2050 surpassing most diseases on a global scale that&amp;#39;s according to a study published in the landsat journal the research reveals that more than half a billion people currently live with diabetes worldwide and every country is expected to witness a major increase rapidly Rising levels of obesity and widening inequalities in healthcare are identified as key factors so will the world heed the warning and address the diabetes threat and can a healthier future be secured for everyone we&amp;#39;ll put these questions to our guests in just a moment but first this report from nihad al-abedi experts describe the data as alarming diabetes is outpacing most diseases around the world 529 million people are estimated to already be living with the condition a study published in the landsat medical journal says that number will exceed 1.3 billion over the next 30 years that&amp;#39;s double of the current rates globally it says diabetes will be a defining disease of the century how the Health Community deals with it in the next two decades will shape population health and life expectancy for the next 80 years diabetes is a chronic health condition that occurs when the body&amp;#39;s ability to regulate levels of blood sugar is impaired type 2 is the most common form accounting for about 96 percent of all cases it develops when the body becomes resistant to insulin or fails to produce enough cases of diabetes are expected to soar in all 204 countries studied by researchers at the global burden of disease International Consortium but North Africa and the Middle East is the most affected region people aged 65 and older are most at risk the report showed 20 percent of people living with the condition were in that age group in every country but the consequences extend beyond the disease itself as millions are at the heightened risk of developing others although diabetes is preventable in many cases the growth in the number of people falling ill isn&amp;#39;t slowing down access to screening and treatment definitely varies and depends on people&amp;#39;s income and where they live and who they are um screening for one depends on whether someone has health insurance whether they know to go to the doctor every year and to have their glucose levels checked and treatment such as insulin is still very very expensive in many parts of the world and not very accessible health organizations are calling for Urgent intervention focusing on Lifestyle Changes finding the best strategies to prevent and treat diabetes is now a raise Against Time for Inside Story foreign professor of medicine at Wild Cornell medicine in Qatar and a pioneering researcher of diabetes in San Diego California Dr Shivani Agarwal associate professor of medicine at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine she is a lead author on one of the Lancet reports and in Cambridge in the UK Muhammad head of artificial intelligence at sports data provider stats bomb a warm welcome to all three of you thank you so much for joining us on Inside Story Dr Shivani in San Diego let me start with you diabetes is described as the greatest epidemic in human history but the landsat report which you authored also highlights the lack of understanding of this disease so can you start off by telling us what this condition is and the scale and threat the disease poses yes thank you so much for having me on our reports show that the scale of this disease is very large it&amp;#39;s Inc it&amp;#39;s including every country age every age group and it&amp;#39;s only growing with time so diabetes is a tricky disease it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s a silent disease for a very long time until discovered or someone gets particularly sick and so screening is is very important but more importantly awareness of these rates are very important because without awareness and understanding that diabetes can be silent people will not be able to access or see care okay so why is this report Dr Shivani which you you authored why is this important especially now why this report is important is because the what we wanted to um promote was that the individual is not to blame here that the individual is in a larger social context and so there are structural factors the way we live the way we work the way that we play what access to food we have what access to health care and high quality health care we have um that a lot of the social factors are actually contributing to these rates and will contribute to the inequity and the growing rates right and so it&amp;#39;s really important to understand that we live in a context okay great Dr Reyes let me come to you the report says that by 2045 as many as three in four adults with diabetes will be living in low and middle income countries and the numbers in the Middle East North Africa region really surprised me and I wanted to ask you about this region in particular what are some of the unique challenges and factors uh that uh that are specific to this condition that contribute to the high prevalence that we see in this region thank you for having me on um I mean I think the main concern here is that much higher prevalence of type 2 diabetes in this region and it goes hand in hand with the much higher prevalence of obesity in the region and that really is a major driver which was highlighted from the Lancet report as well that the major contributor to the higher prevalence of diabetes which is as high as 20 percent in this region is driven primarily by obesity um and I I think you know this part of the world in particular has witnessed this rapid urbanization which is um where our population has changed um markedly in terms of our supply of food processed food and changing the way we are physically less active so as a consequence weight has gone up and as a consequence diabetes has become more manifest so so rapid urbanization you say is a major social driver of the disease in this region uh Dr Reyes I wanted to ask you though about the stigma around diabetes a lot of people are ashamed to say they have diabetes how does that impact the management of the disease okay so I think there we really have to change uh what we as as clinicians Physicians say to our patients so often what what you know was said is that oh you&amp;#39;ve got diabetes there&amp;#39;s a terrible disease you&amp;#39;re going to need this this you know you&amp;#39;re gonna need insulin and it scares patients what we need to be is much more positive and actually say yes you have got diabetes but actually now if you do something about this disease if you are able to lose a certain amount of weight if you&amp;#39;re able to change your diet and increase physical activity then you can do something about this and there are now data compelling data which show that we can reverse type 2 diabetes right Mohammed I want to just pick up on on what Dr Reyes said there and come to you he said that when you know you have the disease you can actually do something about it right but almost half of the adults with diabetes are unaware that they have the condition and 9 out of 10 people with undiagnosed diabetes live in lower in Middle income countries to what extent is science and technology a factor in all this also to what extent is science and technology responsible for the lack of of understanding and perhaps people not being aware of the condition um well I think it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s actually quite the opposite I think Science and Technology can potentially resolve that issue um perhaps you know the fact that today sensor systems mobile devices wearables all of these are Technologies Fitness Health Data are readily available to us and to the country but are they readily available in low and middle income countries I mean obviously with time these things can become cheaper with time obviously there&amp;#39;s a still a large you know portion of the population that might not have that availability but that&amp;#39;s kind of a responsibility for the global Community to address that these sort of devices now actually almost you know the vast you know you know mobile devices for example are you know cheaply produced these days and can potentially really accessible to a lot of different parts of the world um that obviously can provide for us a lot of data that can help us monitor remote patient Monitor and provide some form early detection and risk assessment for patients yeah Dr shivana and I do want to address the geographical inequalities and inequities uh with you because this is a a big focus of the report what are some of the key Geographic inequalities in care and treatment and how are they impacting Health outcomes for people around the world yes thank you for that question so so just what we spoke about infrastructure is very important if there&amp;#39;s not enough Broadband Wi-Fi or Internet these Technologies a lot of them rely on the internet for capabilities that is not going to be available to people in middle and lower income countries just for that alone um the Advanced Therapeutics that we have that are really amazing glp1 Agonist slt2 Inhibitors they are not getting to everyone because the access to care is an issue and those medications are expensive and so um the Health Care Systems of these lower and middle-income countries are not cannot pay for those kinds of Advanced Therapeutics that really can actually move the needle on premature mortality and diabetes and so we&amp;#39;re seeing these really really wide inequities between countries right um just do infrastructure in government Dr Reyes what are your thoughts on about this why are many Health Care Systems not prepared to intervene early in diabetes I think again part of it is actually in relation to the evidence that we had previously which was that you know once you&amp;#39;ve got type 2 diabetes is pretty much you know a life sentence so you&amp;#39;ve got it for life we cannot reverse it and I think the evidence now coming through prior prior to this with bariatric surgery where it was an extreme form of intervention but nevertheless was very effective in curing type 2 diabetes Now is coming through a shivanya said about from glp-1 therapies for example and so we now have I think you know a a direction which is that you know this is not a life sentence this is something that we can intervene with and we can reverse and I think as that message changes we will have you know it will be more positively received by the patients um and I hope big Pharma also take note and make these medicines more accessible to our patients that is make them cheaper right Mohammed I will ask you in a bit about the latest trends and developments in AI based diabetes research because that&amp;#39;s what you specialize on but I wanted to ask Dr shivana first about the specific case of the United States which one of the reports focuses on it gives the example of the US which is not a low end middle income country and yet you have a high prevalence of diabetes to type 2 diabetes especially among young people what are the social and environmental factors that have led to this increase in the US in particular thank you yes so there are marginalized populations everywhere um and so in the US we have many marginalized populations based on their race ethnicity um and so in our black American communities and our Hispanic American communities they don&amp;#39;t have access to the same um um green spaces and um healthy food options that other more High income hoods may have and so we&amp;#39;re seeing these really rapid inequities develop again because we have a lot of junk food in our corner stores we don&amp;#39;t have access to fresh fruits and vegetables we don&amp;#39;t have access to Green spaces and all these obesogenic environments basically are being uh so is it structural racism would you describe it as structural racism as a driver of diabetes in these communities yes definitely very much there&amp;#39;s structural racism in the zoning laws for um for where we live and what is allowed to be um in our neighborhoods there are structural racism access to care but so there&amp;#39;s a lot of kind of um clinics that pop up in some underserved neighborhoods but the high quality the quality of that care is um is not as good um there&amp;#39;s provider um racism as well there&amp;#39;s bias and so um even if there is access to care there is a lot of um apprehension to prescribe certain Advanced Therapeutics because of implicit so then why isn&amp;#39;t that Dr Shivani why isn&amp;#39;t there more focused and on the role of structural racism in this I I think there has been um but now now all people are paying attention because of the numbers the numbers are driving this um this openness to say well okay we are going to top one billion people by 2050 and we have to do something about this now but we must take a really magnified look at what is fueling this crisis and it&amp;#39;s this inequity it&amp;#39;s geographical inequity it&amp;#39;s structural racism and now is the time to actually take a hard look ask the hard questions and do something about it and we can in our second paper we actually discuss ways to tackle and combat and dismantle structural racism and geographical inequity okay Mohammed dabasso what can we do about this what are some of the latest trends and developments in artificial intelligence-based research uh regarding diabetes yeah I mean I&amp;#39;ve got to say um just kind of point on a previous discussion is that I think the failure isn&amp;#39;t really necessarily because of the technology it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s a it&amp;#39;s a it&amp;#39;s a failure of society the fact that nowadays we have uh the ability of the technology that&amp;#39;s more available than ever to allow us to help people uh somehow that hasn&amp;#39;t been deployed or adopted everywhere and you know with with the kind of Advent of sensor systems and machine learning and you know an AI all of this is becoming a lot easier to access but again as the development in technology is getting better but it&amp;#39;s our responsibility as a society to be able to distribute this wider and on your course here I think you know being able for example the work that Professor Roy as Malik has been doing for example on focal microscopy for example this is actually a huge Advantage for us to be able to do early detection and risk management and assessment because you know obviously it&amp;#39;s key for us to be able to detect the these sort of diseases as well as possible so we can actually intervene but also being able to you know utilize the the vast amount of data that we can these days actually get from either mobile mobile devices or wearables telemedicine in general like being able to do remote patient monitoring you know being able to reach like remote areas you know very difficult and sort of hard inaccessible areas that in a traditional sort of a clinical sort of Aid is going to be very difficult to reach and also reducing the cost the reducing the cost in and actually carrying these assessments on this monitoring you know diabetes is one of those diseases that requires a lot of management and because of that it requires is actually quite costly and and that could be prohibitive for a lot of sort of middle income and low-income sort of areas so being able to reduce that loss through technology is going to be key and artificial intelligence is is a key component in all of this because it helps us automate as much as possible in the process and reduce the burden on the clinical sort of staff and experts in this domain Dr Reyes your thoughts about this uh Mohammed says the failure is not a failure of the technology but of society how can Ai and machine learning play a role in addressing the inequities in Diabetes Care well I think there is plenty of data by data I mean you know information out there um that is available that could be harnessed used by artificial intelligence to actually bring together um information from all over the world on our patients on you know not just whether or not they have diabetes but pre-diabetes perhaps or those at risk and be able to predict those that are highest risk so we can then Target those patients people rather before they become diabetic patients and I think that&amp;#39;s a major strength of AI that we kind of predictive models um you know it&amp;#39;s being honest what are some of the Innovative approaches being taken in this region in Qatar for example to address diabetes and improve care access so actually we have a diabetes care plan for example you know run from 2016 to 2022 and we&amp;#39;re now renewing this to 2030 to really try to look at this at a number of different levels in terms of you know at the societal level at the care level how to deliver care better to people who&amp;#39;ve already got diabetes but also to try and prevent diabetes so starting with school-aged children to try and you know educate them to stop them from having obesity which is a major problem in this region we talk about inequity of healthcare maybe in the US but you know I could say in Qatar the people who have this issue obesity diabetes are not the ones who are underprivileged actually they&amp;#39;re the ones that are over privileged you know we have to address these concerns okay so how then do we address the concerns Dr Shivani Beyond raising awareness what can be done in your view to provide accessible treatment accessible Equitable treatment and what are currently the best strategies you think that are out there that are cost effective yeah so we outline a three-point strategy in our second paper of the series that includes changing the ecosystem building capacity and improving the clinical practice environment and a lot of what&amp;#39;s been touched on here is it goes into one of those categories so when we say changing the ecosystem we provide real world examples of how to work in multi-sectoral collaborations between pharmaceutical companies governments private funders to actually change the infrastructure of the system um more healthy food in Internet and internet infrastructure for Technologies to be able to work insulin access to supplies um building capacity is really that diabetes is infinite access is really a key issue isn&amp;#39;t it because there are only about three companies that produce insulin and that affects the price doesn&amp;#39;t it very much very much it is really um insulin is expensive and we have this problem in the U.S too by the way so the U.S just capped um a vial of insulin at 35 per month um and so we really have this problem everywhere but there are um we do highlight a sub-Saharan African intervention that was a multi-sectoral intervention um to bring insulin and its supplies to these underserved Villages and we saw rapid improvements in hemoglobin A1c in children um death rate went down in months I mean this is really you know there&amp;#39;s a big infrastructure and access issue here that could actually be solved building capacity is our kind of our second category of terms and what I was going to say is we in the Health Care system do not have enough Health Care Providers to um ready for the amount of needs and people with diabetes and so we have to arm Primary Care Providers um you know diabetes is not a specialty disease anymore but we also need other workers community health workers peer support that can help increase our Workforce and then the last piece is improving the clinical practice environment so what was discussed here is how we speak to our patients this is not doesn&amp;#39;t have to be a lethal a little more we have to change the way that medical education is structured we&amp;#39;re so diagnosis focused that we forget how to actually manage this chronic disease we have to work with our patients understand their unmet social needs and actually incorporate their eating habits and their insulin taking or medication taking habits physical activity habits into their lifestyle right so we really have to change the way we think about the patient yeah as well interesting that you talk about changing the way medical education is structured Mohammed I want to come back to you and talk a little bit more about artificial intelligence because you know when we hear AI today a lot of people you know are worried and it raises red flags and I wanted to know about the potential ethical and privacy concerns related to the use of AI in diabetes this care and how they can be addressed obviously yeah I mean AI is is quite sort of in the uh public eye these days um rightly so a lot of people are concerned uh it&amp;#39;s actually you know I think the way I think of AI is as a technology that has a great potential um not only the fact that it&amp;#39;s at the moment is looked at as some nice to have but in my mind I think at least probably in the next maybe 10 or maybe 15 years is going to be a necessity um and obviously you know that comes with a lot of um you know concerns and issues that need to be resolved one of them is ethical um the ethics of AI and how AI has been deployed as we know there&amp;#39;s a lot of sort of bias in AI sort of model development and data sets and and sort of potential as well applications because of uh sort of Monopoly and on big organization who can actually have all the you know the affordability to be able to run these sort of models and techniques but that&amp;#39;s sort of the discussion that we need to have as a society to be able to make Aki accessible and you know widely used in this area you know I can help a lot I can it can be a force multiplier I mean with the Aging population of the globe we need we need more automation than ever you know we need to be able to help our clinical sort of staff and expert to be able to have a much wider reach and have more efficient workload and can actually cope with the enormous sort of pressure and demand that they&amp;#39;re facing these days and and AI can have a a an important role in all of this so I I see AI as a positive in all this obviously there&amp;#39;s a lot of issues that we need to resolve as a society not only in in the medical domain but everywhere in terms of how AI has been used by you and how it&amp;#39;s being deployed but you know we need to do this all together as and make sure that we set the regulation the the ethics the the assessment around all of that to make sure that it&amp;#39;s actually being used safely and democratically by everybody yeah so AI is a positive but it has to be used safely and democratically Dr Reyes I want to come to you and just address one of the points Dr Shivani was making about changing the way medical education is structured and you touched on this a little bit earlier how do we do that and and how do we get you know whether it&amp;#39;s governments and and and uh how do we get also uh Healthcare make Health Healthcare Providers rather policy makers how do we get them to address this aspect and also address it as parities and help promote more Equitable access to diabetes treatment and care yeah I mean I think again the core message that I want I think we should be teaching in medical school is that diabetes is no longer a disease that is of course rampant but um is irreversible you know I think we have to have that positive message and that positive message is there you know with evidence now to support this so um if we start with that at medical school then you change the attitude of people like me who go into into say diabetes you know it kind of it makes you want to do this specialty because you can do something positive for the patients you can make them people you know kind of like you reverse their diabetes so that&amp;#39;s one aspect of it um in terms of actually uh Muhammad talking about AI I think there&amp;#39;s a great need for medical students residents to be educated about Ai and how it could be utilized in the healthcare sector rather than have you know AI Engineers impose upon us and we aren&amp;#39;t really aware of it um you know we should we should be starting at the the Grassroots level to educate people about the utility of AI okay Dr Shivani I&amp;#39;ll give you the last word uh the figures in the report are certainly very scary but you know from what we&amp;#39;ve heard in this conversation it&amp;#39;s not all doom and Gloop definitely not there is so much we can do about this but we have to come together as a global community and work on this together so while there&amp;#39;s there are Regional challenges we have understood from our work that there are actually a lot of shared challenges and so if we come together put our minds together we will definitely come up with Solutions thank you to all three of you for a very interesting and insightful discussion on this very important topic that affects everyone everywhere thank you very much Dr Shivani agaval Dr ayaz Malik and Muhammad thank you to all three of you and thank you as well for

    "transcript": "Can you\nhave oatmeal when you have diabetes? That’s a really good question because\nno matter how healthy oats actually are, in some cases, you may still notice\nthat they spike your blood sugar levels. But why? I’ll talk about all of that in this video,\nso let’s get into it! So, one of the main reasons why it can be\na little hard to wrap your head around whether oatmeal is good for people\nwith diabetes is that it’s a carbohydrate. But don’t get tricked:\nit can be a great addition to your diet while managing diabetes,\nespecially if you eat them for breakfast instead of high-carb, high-sugar meals,\nsuch as white bread or other pastries. Oats have a glycemic\nindex score of 55 or lower when prepared with minimal processing,\nwhich makes them less likely to cause spikes in blood sugar levels. Half a cup of oats\ncontains 52 grams of carbs, and I know that you may not like\nwhat you hear here since it’s a lot. However, it is important to consider\nthat about 8 of these grams come in the form of fiber. And fiber has been shown\nto have significant blood-sugar-reducing properties. Keep in mind that The American Diabetes\nAssociation notes that adults should eat at least 25–30 grams of fiber each day, but most people don’t even come close. And a serving of oatmeal adds\n8 grams of fiber to the diet, making it much easier\nto reach dietary recommendations. Fiber-rich foods like oatmeal\nmay also help keep you feeling satisfied for longer. But with that in mind,\nit is still important to eat oats in moderation and follow a meal plan\nthat is suitable for diabetes. However, oatmeal can be made of different\ntypes of oats, and when it comes to blood sugar management,\nthey are not all created equal. It’s really important\nwhat kind of oatmeals you choose. The best options are old-fashioned\nor steel-cut oats. They contain a higher amount of soluble\nfiber that slows digestion and helps better\nregulate blood sugar. Oatmeal in its most basic\nform is simply oats and water,\nbut I know it may taste really bland. The good news is that there are a few safe\nways to add flavor to simple oatmeal\nand make it more enjoyable. So here’s what you can do:\nAdd some cinnamon. Use low-fat milk. Mix it with the water during cooking\nor add it at the end. This gives the oatmeal a richer flavor. Add a tablespoon of nut butter for extra protein and flavor.\nAdd berries. They have antioxidants, good nutrients,\nand can act as a natural sweetener.\nAlright, so keep in mind that as long as you keep your total carbs\nor GI scores in mind, there are loads of ways\nto make basic oatmeal outstanding. But do you remember I talked about those\nblood sugar spikes after eating oatmeal? Well, there’s a chance that it happens\nbecause you choose the wrong type of oats. What you really need to avoid is processed\noats, instant oats, and cereal bars. These are highly processed,\nwhich means they are digested faster, and the blood sugar increases faster\nas well. Also, instant oatmeal often\nhas added sugar and other ingredients, so it’s a great possibility that you’ll\nconsume too much of them at one time. Okay, I want you to listen\ncarefully now: there’s no such thing as a single best “diabetes\ndiet.” There isn’t ONE food that works for everyone. And we can also apply it to oatmeal. Oatmeal has a lot of great health\nbenefits, and studies have shown that it can be beneficial for people\nwith diabetes. But we’re all different,\nand how your blood sugars react to eating oatmeal might be different from how other\npeople&amp;#39;s blood sugars react. So it’s important that you learn\nwhat works for you. Measure your blood sugars before\nand after your oatmeal. This way, you’ll understand\nhow it affects your blood sugar. Once you’ve done that a few times,\nyou can make an informed decision on whether oatmeal is the right choice\nfor your daily breakfast or just something to be enjoyed\noccasionally. Now watch these videos that you can see right\nhere, stay safe, and see you next time!",

    "transcript": "hi everyone my name is jen riley i&amp;#39;m a diabetes educator and dietitian with the diabetes program at children&amp;#39;s national hospital and today i wanted to talk to you all about carbs and healthy eating and how to calculate insulin doses for the carbs that are in your meals and snacks the first thing we need to talk about before we figure out how to calculate that insulin is which foods have carbs now of course when it comes to healthy eating it&amp;#39;s important to eat a variety of foods you need your fruits you need your veggies you need your protein foods and you need some some kind of fiber you need lots of healthy foods just to make it balanced it&amp;#39;s important to have a colorful plate you got that from your fruits and veggies but then you need those carbs you need those protein foods to keep your energy up as well so let&amp;#39;s first talk about which foods have the carbs lots of foods have carbs the majority of the foods on this table have carbs the importance of knowing which foods have carbohydrates is because when you&amp;#39;re taking insulin foods with carbohydrates are the ones that are going to raise your blood sugar level so it&amp;#39;s important then to count those carbs so you know how much insulin to give carbs are in many many many foods to start fruits have carbs so bananas one fruit that has carbs apples oranges all the fruits have carbs even fruit juices like this capri sun then we also have dried fruit so whether it be raisins or dried mango more carbs in these foods most veggies do not have carbs however there are some starchy veggies that do this sweet potato for example is one that has a good bit of carbs so you&amp;#39;ll need to count that in your calculations as well that&amp;#39;s going to raise your blood sugar level corn whether it be on the cob in the can frozen corn will always have some carbs also regular potatoes and green peas have carbs as well so while these fruits and veggies are super super healthy and you need to keep them in your diet it&amp;#39;s important to know how many carbs are in them when it comes to calculating your insulin other foods that have carbs anything with flour or sugar is going to have carbs so that cut that starts with we got some bread over here so bread has some carbs there&amp;#39;s flour and bread even if it&amp;#39;s gluten-free bread it still has rice flour so that&amp;#39;s going to have some carbs snack foods have have carbs they have flour in them mac and cheese rice pasta all of these foods have carbohydrates also some beans and lentils have carbs as well so these are other foods that you&amp;#39;re going to need to count in your carb calculations and then the really good stuff the snack foods and the dessert foods so cookies goldfish crackers more cookies cakes these foods all have carbohydrates as well so when it comes to calculating your insulin doses you&amp;#39;re going to want to know which of these foods are in your meal and then we&amp;#39;re going to talk about how to figure out how much insulin to calculate for those foods based on the carb content one last little category that does have some carbohydrates some dairy foods so this this milk will have some carbohydrates also yogurt has some carbohydrates but then to keep it interesting there are some dairy foods that don&amp;#39;t have carbohydrates uh cheese is one so if you can have a cheese stick which has no carbohydrates but when you have a glass of milk that does have carbohydrates so it gets a little tricky but you can keep track of all these things and what we&amp;#39;re going to do next is we&amp;#39;re going to do some sample meals and calculating carbs and you&amp;#39;re going to see it&amp;#39;s a lot easier than you think all right so now that you know what foods do have carbohydrates you might be wondering are there any foods that don&amp;#39;t have carbohydrates and the answer is yes all these veggies that don&amp;#39;t have the starchiness to them they are basically carbohydrate free they&amp;#39;re very low on carbohydrates so these foods don&amp;#39;t have carbohydrates and they won&amp;#39;t be counted in your carb count when you&amp;#39;re trying to figure out insulin also a lot of the protein foods so eggs cheese meats they don&amp;#39;t have carbohydrates either so they won&amp;#39;t count into your carb count and you&amp;#39;re going to see that when we do our sample meals avocado is another another it&amp;#39;s actually a fruit but it&amp;#39;s another food that doesn&amp;#39;t have carbohydrate i guess it&amp;#39;s the only fruit that doesn&amp;#39;t have carbohydrates significant enough to count in your carb counts other foods include nuts and seeds and nut butters like peanut butter or almond butter they have some carbohydrates but low enough that they don&amp;#39;t typically raise blood sugar level very much and you typically don&amp;#39;t need to count those foods in your carb counts and also condiments so mayonnaise hummus mustard even ketchup even though it&amp;#39;s sweet we typically don&amp;#39;t eat enough ketchup that it&amp;#39;s going to be a significant source of carbohydrates when we&amp;#39;re doing our calculations all right so these are all the foods that might make up your your day so next what we&amp;#39;re going to do is do some sample meals so you can see how simple this really can be all right now that we&amp;#39;ve figured out which foods have carbs let&amp;#39;s eat breakfast for breakfast today i&amp;#39;m gonna have some cheerios cereal i&amp;#39;m gonna have a hard-boiled egg i&amp;#39;m gonna have some orange juice i&amp;#39;m going to put some regular milk on top of that cereal and then i&amp;#39;m also in the mood for my favorite fruit which is strawberries all right so now there are three ways that we can figure out carbs in these different foods first of all let&amp;#39;s talk about which foods have carbs cereal it&amp;#39;s got greens in it so that has carbs the milk that&amp;#39;s one of those dairy foods that has carbs so i&amp;#39;m going to need to count those carbs as well the orange juice is from fruit that also has carbs the hard-boiled egg is a protein food no carbs in that one so that&amp;#39;s one thing i don&amp;#39;t have to count but the strawberries are fruit and those have carbs as well so basically the majority of the foods in my meal have carbs and i&amp;#39;m going to need to figure out how many so when we&amp;#39;re when we&amp;#39;re trying to figure those carbs out there are three ways to that we can do that many foods have food labels so this milk for example this is a different brand of dairy milk called fair life so this label uh has two things that i want to keep my eyes on one is the serving size and for this it&amp;#39;s one cup so one cup of this milk has a total carbohydrate amount of six grams so i need to know the serving size and i need to look at the total carbs so if i have one cup of this milk i&amp;#39;m gonna add up six grams of carbohydrate for my carb count all right so that&amp;#39;s one way looking at the food label a second way is using an app or a book called calorie king i have a very handy app on my phone and i can look up any food out there so this is helpful even if something does have a food label i&amp;#39;m going to be able to find it in my calorie king app but calorie king comes in really handy for fresh foods that don&amp;#39;t have labels like these strawberries i don&amp;#39;t know how many carbs are in these there&amp;#39;s no label on them and that&amp;#39;s a good thing it&amp;#39;s good to have lots of foods that don&amp;#39;t have labels that means they&amp;#39;re probably found in the produce section of the grocery store so i can look up whole strawberries in my app and if i were to look that up now i see that one cup of whole strawberries has 11 grams of carbohydrates so i&amp;#39;m gonna measure out one cup of these whole strawberries for my breakfast meal all right the third way to try to figure out carbs in a meal is to eyeball it and this is not something we recommend and i&amp;#39;m going to show you why um if i were to eyeball this these cheerios now they say that on the label it says that one and a half cups of these cheerios has 29 grams of carbohydrates so i think i know what a one and a half cups looks like so i&amp;#39;m going to actually pour that into this bowl that looks about right to me that&amp;#39;s a good size bowl of cereal one and a half cups all right so now let me go ahead and put that in my measuring cup and just see how close i was okay that&amp;#39;s one cup i&amp;#39;ve already made a mess and lost some of my cheerios now i need about half of that one and a half cups all right that&amp;#39;s one and a half cups look how poorly i estimated that amount of cheerios this is probably three cups worth of cheerios so eyeballing is not something we would recommend in terms of carb counting your foods ideally you&amp;#39;ll use your app you&amp;#39;ll use a book the calorie king book or you use those food labels all right now let me clean up this mess and we&amp;#39;ll start our breakfast counts all right so let&amp;#39;s count the carbs in our meal we&amp;#39;ve got to count the carbs in the cheerios we&amp;#39;ve got to count the carbs in the milk we&amp;#39;ve got to count the carbs in the orange juice and we&amp;#39;ve got to count the carbs in the strawberries so that&amp;#39;s four items all right so i&amp;#39;m going to start i like to having a white board at home because i can just count every meal wipe it down and have it ready for the next meal all right so my carbs first off we&amp;#39;ve got the cheerios so the cheerios the label said that one and a half cups was 29 grams of carbs so i&amp;#39;m gonna measure out one and a half cups and i&amp;#39;m going to write down 29 grams on my white board all right let&amp;#39;s measure this out so we&amp;#39;ve got this is a one cup measure oops and then we&amp;#39;ll do a half again of that so that&amp;#39;s about one and a half cups of our cheerios 29 grams of carbs next up we&amp;#39;re gonna add a cup of milk to that so with my one cup of milk that&amp;#39;s 13 grams of carbs so let me add that to my list so one cup of milk 13 grams of carbs all right so we&amp;#39;ll put that in right you got one cup of milk looks good all right next up next up i&amp;#39;m going to have a half cup of orange juice so in my house we actually have two of our kids have type 1 diabetes so one of our home hacks that we use is we&amp;#39;ve taken a bunch of our plastic cups and we&amp;#39;ve marked what one half cup is in sharpie so i don&amp;#39;t have to use a measuring cup i can just pour the orange juice up to this line and i know that&amp;#39;s half of a cup all right there we go we got our orange juice and a half a cup of this orange juice and i can tell from the food label one one cup is 26 grams of carbohydrates so half of that would be half a cup would be 13 grams of carbohydrates so i&amp;#39;m going to write that down all right one half cup oj 13 grams all right final thing my favorite fruit my strawberries so i looked in my app and this was 11 grams of carbohydrates for a cup of whole strawberries so let me just put some of these in my measuring cup that looks about right and i&amp;#39;ve got one cup of strawberries that i&amp;#39;m going to enjoy with my breakfast all right so we&amp;#39;ll add those to our list one cup of strawberries is 11 grams of carbohydrate now i might think i can do this in my head but i&amp;#39;m not going to rely on my head for this this addition i&amp;#39;m going to use my calculator all right we have 29 grams plus 13 grams plus 13 grams plus 11. i&amp;#39;ve got 66 grams of carbohydrates in this meal all right so now what i do with that 66 grams the next step is you&amp;#39;ll divide it by what your provider has given you as your carb ratio so i can give an example one of my kids at home his carb ratio for breakfast is 20 grams so he gets a unit of insulin for every 20 grams of carbohydrates so i would take this 66 and divide it by 20 and then i would get my total insulin dose so i&amp;#39;m going to use my calculator again 66 divided by 20. 3.3 units of insulin for this meal all right and with his insulin pen i&amp;#39;m gonna round that down to three units so what i&amp;#39;ll do here i&amp;#39;ve counted up my carbs i&amp;#39;ve measured out my food i&amp;#39;ve calculated my insulin i&amp;#39;ll take i&amp;#39;ll take these three units of insulin and then i can finally eat all right well now what happens if i&amp;#39;ve eaten my bowl of cereal i had my hard-boiled egg i drank my orange juice and i can&amp;#39;t i don&amp;#39;t really have room for all these strawberries well i&amp;#39;ve already taken insulin for all these strawberries so i don&amp;#39;t want to go low from having too much insulin for the food that i&amp;#39;ve i&amp;#39;ve thought i was going to eat so what i can do is actually it&amp;#39;s easier to drink carbohydrates than to eat them so i can add a couple extra ounces of orange juice and make up for the half of the strawberries that i didn&amp;#39;t have all right so say i need to make up five or six grams of carbohydrate i can have another two ounces of orange juice all right so i could pour a little bit more in my orange juice cup in this case all right and you could measure that out two ounces is a quarter of a cup all right and now that i&amp;#39;ve had all the carbs that i&amp;#39;ve given insulin for i should be good to go and then i&amp;#39;ve had my breakfast i&amp;#39;m all filled up and energized and i&amp;#39;m going to go outside and play okay now let&amp;#39;s review how we figure out how much insulin we&amp;#39;re going to give for this meal it had a total of 66 grams of carbohydrate and what i do now is i divide that by my carb ratio that was given to me by my provider in this example i&amp;#39;m going to use a carb ratio of 1 unit for every 20 grams of carbohydrates so i take the 66 grams and i divided by 20 and on my calculator i get 3.3 units if i&amp;#39;m using insulin by an injection with a pen that means i round down to a whole unit of three units so in this case i would inject three units of insulin all right now let&amp;#39;s make a dinner uh tonight for dinner we&amp;#39;re gonna have some soft tacos some chips and salsa and guac on the side and then some homemade chocolate cake for dessert so first thing i need to do is figure out which foods have carbohydrates that i need to consider in my calculation in this meal i&amp;#39;m going to have tortillas so this kind of brand of tortilla they do have a food label so i&amp;#39;ll be able to tell the carbs from that package i&amp;#39;m also going to have the chips which these also have a food label so i can again tell the carbs in this food the salsa and the guacamole are considered low carb foods they&amp;#39;re condiments so i&amp;#39;m not going to need to count the carbohydrates in those foods this is a salsa fresca that we&amp;#39;re going to have with our dinner then i&amp;#39;m going to fill the soft tacos with some chicken that i&amp;#39;ve cooked with just some spices some fresh tomatoes chopped up some cheese and some sour cream so all these items are very very low carb so i&amp;#39;m not going to need to consider those in my calculations and then even though i might not have dessert with my dinner i know i&amp;#39;m going to have it pretty soon after so i can con add those carbs from the dessert in my total calculation and give all of that insulin at the beginning of the meal as long as i don&amp;#39;t wait too long to have dessert after dinner it&amp;#39;s fine to group all of those carbs into that one insulin dose and get that at the beginning of the meal all right so let&amp;#39;s let&amp;#39;s make our meal all right so i&amp;#39;m going to have i think i&amp;#39;m gonna have two small soft tacos so each one of these tortillas has 15 grams of carbohydrate so in my two that means i&amp;#39;m gonna have 30 grams of carbohydrate so we&amp;#39;re going to start by building those and i&amp;#39;m going to use my white board again all right i&amp;#39;m going to write down my carbs so two tortillas 30 grams of carbs all right so i have those two tortillas i&amp;#39;m pretty sure that&amp;#39;s what i&amp;#39;m going to want to eat i&amp;#39;m not going to be hungry after 30 grams of carbohydrates all right now i&amp;#39;m going to fill those tortillas with a little bit of chicken alright i&amp;#39;m going to add a little bit of sour cream i&amp;#39;m going to put on some fresh tomatoes and then also a little bit of shredded cheese all right now you can heat those up you can eat them as is however you prefer all right now in addition to these tacos i&amp;#39;d like some chips and guacamole and some salsa so i do need to count the carbohydrates in the chips looking at the label these have it says 24 chips is about 18 grams of carbohydrate um i&amp;#39;m not sure i really feel like counting out 24 chips and a lot of them are broken so for this calculation what i&amp;#39;m going to do is use my food scale you don&amp;#39;t have to have a food scale to count carbs but i do find it really handy to have one for certain things like snack foods sometimes breakfast cereal so dried fruit actually is another one i like to use that for so on my food scale i have this here i first just need to zero it out this one has a bowl that comes with it which is nice because then you could even just put your chips in this bowl and take it to the table and have that but i&amp;#39;ll first zero that out and when in looking at the food label i see that the 24 chips weigh 28 grams so i&amp;#39;m going to just pour out until i get to the 28 grams on my food scale all right it&amp;#39;s got 33 so i&amp;#39;ll put a couple back all right so to me that&amp;#39;s a lot easier than counting out 24 chips so i have my chips here put them on my plate and i&amp;#39;m going to write that down on my white board so the carbohydrates there were 18 grams all right so my chips 18 grams of carbohydrate all right now i have my condiments which i&amp;#39;m not gonna need anything counted for so my salsa and my guacamole so i can just actually have as much of those condiments as i want now i want to add the calculation for the chocolate cake with the frosting this came from a homemade recipe so i don&amp;#39;t have a carb count i think the you know if when ingredients are eyeballed and nothing is specifically measured uh you do have to you have to do a little bit of guesswork but i can use my app and i can look in calorie king to see what a an average size piece of chocolate cake with frosting would count for carbs another app you can use is called fig we and it with that you can actually take a picture of the food and it will show you the size on the plate and give you an estimated carb count and also if if you&amp;#39;re on an insulin pump the insulin pumps sometimes have food libraries where you can look up food items so if you don&amp;#39;t have calorie king or you want to try another app there are some other options out there for you so looking in my app it looks like a a commercial brand chocolate cake with frosting with this size is about 42 grams of carbohydrates so i&amp;#39;ll just i might not be exactly right but i think that&amp;#39;s pretty close so my cake i&amp;#39;m going to write that down as well 42 grams of carbohydrate all right so what i&amp;#39;m going to do is add that up i&amp;#39;m going to divide again by my carb ratio and figure out how much insulin i need for this meal okay pulling out my calculator we have 30 grams plus 18 grams in the chips and 42 for the cake so that&amp;#39;s a total of 90 grams of carbohydrate okay 90 grams total for this meal i&amp;#39;m going to take that i&amp;#39;m going to divide that by my carb ratio which was given to me by my provider and that&amp;#39;s 20 one unit for every 20 grams of carbohydrate and that comes out to 4.5 units of insulin and that one i&amp;#39;m gonna round up to five units with our basic rounding rules if it&amp;#39;s 0.5 or more you round up if it&amp;#39;s 0.4 or less you round down so i&amp;#39;m going to inject five units of insulin for this meal and then i&amp;#39;ll be able to eat it all right here&amp;#39;s our board again okay now let&amp;#39;s say i&amp;#39;ve eaten all this food maybe i even already ate my chocolate cake and i&amp;#39;m still hungry what do we do we&amp;#39;ve already taken our insulin and that insulin was simply for these carbs well don&amp;#39;t forget that you can still have any of those low carb foods you want and they don&amp;#39;t require insulin so what i could do in this situation is i could have some more of the chicken i could top it with some of the tomatoes and the cheese and the sour cream and even some guacamole and salsa i could have almost a little uh burrito without the burrito without the tortilla so that&amp;#39;s what i would do in this case if i was still hungry you can still have those protein foods and those the veggies and some of those dairy foods that don&amp;#39;t have carbs that way you don&amp;#39;t you don&amp;#39;t leave hungry if you wanted another piece of cake you would have to take more insulin for that so you&amp;#39;ve already had your nice size dessert so you can add some more of those low-carb foods and be nicely filled up all right let&amp;#39;s review this meal and how much insulin you need to take for it uh our we have our two tortillas those are 30 grams of carbohydrates you had your tortilla chips for 18 grams of carbohydrate and then your piece of chocolate cake was 42 grams of carbohydrate adding that all up that comes up to 90 grams of carbohydrate what you do with that total is you&amp;#39;ll divide it by the carb ratio that your provider has given to you to calculate your insulin so in this example we&amp;#39;re going to use a carb ratio of a unit for every 20 grams of carbohydrate so i&amp;#39;ll take that 90 divided by 20 and get 4.5 so i&amp;#39;m going to round that up to 5 units and i would inject 5 units of insulin for this meal one thing you may find really handy is you&amp;#39;re counting out these carbs and common foods that you eat in your household is you can make a cheat sheet of carb counts and put it inside one of your cupboard doors this is something i do in my house so i can look those tortilla chips are always 18 grams of carbohydrates our favorite tortilla that i always buy 15 grams of carbohydrate per tortilla and you can have that list really accessible that comes in handy for babysitters grandparents other caregivers they can access that list really easily and not have to use an app or anything else we find that really helpful in my household well i hope you&amp;#39;ve learned a little bit about carbohydrate counting and how to calculate insulin for food i just want to remind you that you shouldn&amp;#39;t have to change your diet completely when it comes to diabetes all the foods that are typically in your daily plan in your household can fit just some need to be accounted for in terms of insulin doses if you have any more questions about carbohydrates or want to meet with one of the dietitians at children&amp;#39;s national you can contact us at any time you can do one-on-one appointments and our dietitians are there for you with any questions you have about carbs nutrition or healthy eating thank you so much",

    "transcript": "hi I&amp;#39;m Lisa Valente and today we&amp;#39;re sharing diabetes friendly tips for going to the grocery store if you or a loved one has been recently diagnosed with diabetes you may be figuring out a lot of new steps as you learn to manage your diabetes adjusting your diet is a key part and if it&amp;#39;s feeling overwhelming hopefully we can help simplify it today we&amp;#39;ll talk about foods to eat more of foods to limit tips for the grocery store and tips for dining out when you have diabetes foods to enjoy diabetes diet guidelines are actually pretty similar to General healthy eating guidelines you want to balance your meals with lean proteins non-starchy vegetables complex carbohydrates and healthy fats protein Rich options include chicken seafood beef pork tofu and eggs non-star vegetables are dark leafy greens Peppers asparagus cabbage cauliflower broccoli onions mushrooms celery complex carbohydrates deliver fiber so think of whole grains like oats whole wheat bread quinoa starchy vegetables like corn potatoes and squash fruit and beans healthy fats include avocados nuts seeds and olive oil one key difference is that when you have diabetes you need to be much more mindful of the amount of carbohydrates in your diet that includes carbs coming from grains and starches like rice noodles and bread as well as fruit milk drinks and desserts some people with diabetes prefer a lower carb diet while some eat more moderate carbohydrates and research has shown that you can manage your diabetes with either style of eating it is is a myth that you have to cut out all carbs when you have diabetes find a level that works for you with your Healthcare team and adjust as needed now let&amp;#39;s talk about foods to limit while no foods are strictly off limits there are some you should enjoy more sparingly sugary drinks sodas sweet teas and other sugar sweetened beverages can quickly raise blood sugar levels even though fruit juice doesn&amp;#39;t contain added sugar it&amp;#39;s still best to choose whole fruits instead because they have fiber traditional desserts things like ice cream brownies cakes cookies candy these contain a fair amount of carbohydrates mostly coming from refined grains and added sugar without a lot of nutrients you can still have them but be mindful of portion size and look for recipes that may have more diabetes friendly Alternatives like almond flour or non-nutritive sweeteners high carb foods white bread pasta and rice these are not off limits but opt for whole grain Alternatives when you can and be sure to pair smaller amounts of these carbridge foods with protein and veggies other foods and nutrients you may want to limit include Ultra processed foods saturated fat and sodium alcohol alcohol is not a drink that&amp;#39;s recommended for health reasons for anyone but when you have diabetes alcohol can impact your blood sugar negatively here are some grocery shopping tips it&amp;#39;s helpful to know which foods to focus on and limit but how do you shop for food let&amp;#39;s talk through some shopping advice so navigating the grocery store doesn&amp;#39;t feel so tricky plan ahead having an idea of what you&amp;#39;re going to make and cook sets you up for healthy eating success make a grocery list to minimize impulsive purchases and stock up on Diabetes Friendly Foods this helps save you money and get more healthy options into your home Choose Wisely sometimes two products that are very similar say to salad dressings or two yogurts are actually very different when it comes to their nutrition one might have twice as much added sugar as the next so compare labels for processed foods to pick the best option for you it&amp;#39;s not always about carbs it may be that one has more fiber and protein and is more satisfying or one has less sodium it&amp;#39;s always a good idea to check labels and compare do this when you&amp;#39;re buying items like sauces crackers breads yogurts jams and more shop for Staples in a dream world everyone would have a meal plan and know what&amp;#39;s for dinner but sometimes we&amp;#39;re eating on the Fly that&amp;#39;s when having some healthy Staples on hand can be really helpful maybe you always have plain yogurt for a snack or easy breakfast eggs are great for breakfast lunch or dinner you can keep whole wheat or low carb bread in your freezer for toast beans canant tuna Frozen fruits and frozen vegetables without added sauces are also great to have on hand having some healthy options on hand will help guide you to easy meals and snacks when you&amp;#39;re not quite sure what to make understanding food labels is key to making informed choices here&amp;#39;s what to look for serving size all nutrition information is based on the serving size so be mindful of how much you consume serving size doesn&amp;#39;t mean that that&amp;#39;s how much you have to eat or drink you might have more or less but all the nutrition information is tied to the serving size amount listed total carbohydrates this number includes sugars starches and fiber aim for foods with lower total carbs fiber high fiber foods help slow down carbohydrate absorption and keep you feeling full for longer added sugars limit foods with high added sugars which can quickly raise blood sugar levels without a lot of nutrition protein foods that contain protein also help fill you up saturated fat try to keep this to less than 10% of your total calories sodium be especially mindful of sodium if you have high blood pressure or told by your doctor to limit your sodium intake vitamins and minerals not all vitamins and minerals are listed on the label but some key ones are macronutrients that&amp;#39;s carbs protein and fat are important for blood sugar balance and satiety but getting enough micronutrients vitamins and minerals is key for your health as well then there&amp;#39;s the ingredient list there&amp;#39;s no hard and fast rules when it comes to ingredients many people advise to look for foods that are as close to homemade as possible and with ingredients you can pronounce I don&amp;#39;t think that&amp;#39;s a bad idea and it can be a good way to cut back on Ultra processed foods but I tend to be more concerned with the ingredients themselves as far as the amount of added sugar and the type of carbohydrates included understanding some food label Basics can help you make better and more informed choices when it comes to eating out having diabetes doesn&amp;#39;t mean that you can&amp;#39;t go to a restaurant but keep these strategies in mind preview the menu many restaurants post menus online allowing you to plan a diabetes friendly Choice make substitutions don&amp;#39;t be afraid to ask for steamed vegetables instead of fries or a side salad instead of bread it&amp;#39;s not that you can never have fries or bread but I probably skip having both in the same meal and cutting down on the amount that you do have and watch your portion size in general restaurant portions can be really large so consider sharing or taking half home it may feel tricky at first like you have to spend hours at the grocery store or give up all your favorite foods if you have diabetes but it will get easier adapting to a diabetes friendly diet takes time and practice if you aren&amp;#39;t quite ready to overhaul everything you eat start small and make a few changes and then once you get the hang of those make a few more monitor your carb intake focus on Whole Foods read food labels and don&amp;#39;t be afraid to make smart swaps and substitutions we have more resources on healthline.com to help you navigate your diabetes Journey let us know what questions you

never eat sugar or   pasta or bread again they&amp;#39;re just \ngoing to show you how to eat your   carbs in a way that&amp;#39;s also going to help \npour your type two diabetes into [Music] remission hello angels and welcome to the glucose \ngoddess show I&amp;#39;m jine SHP I&amp;#39;m a French biochemist   and I&amp;#39;m here to teach you about to your body \nin today&amp;#39;s episode we&amp;#39;re going to cover insulin   resistance pre-diabetes type two diabetes I&amp;#39;m \ngoing to break some myths I&amp;#39;m going to give   you tips to reverse those conditions easily and \nwithout too much pain or complication I&amp;#39;m really   excited to get started with this topic so let&amp;#39;s \ndo it okay first things first type two diabetes   is a global epidemic the international diabetes \nFederation they publish numbers every year and   they have found that 537 million adults in the \nworld are now living with type two diabetes and   another 541 million are living with pre diabetes \nthese numbers are getting worse every single year   so right now 1 billion people in the world have \neither either type to diabetes or pre-diabetes   and as I&amp;#39;m going to explain this is all linked to \ninsulin resistance we need to do something about   this this is because of the food environment we \nlive in we need more regulation in food supply   food companies but we also need to be educated \nso that we can figure out how to navigate this   difficult landscape that is causing these issues \nso you may have diabetes you may know somebody who   has diabetes you may have insulin resistance you \nmay have pre-diabetes or know somebody who does   this information is going to help you the first \nthing you need to know is that these conditions   are not gener gentic okay type two diabetes is \nnot something that you are born with it&amp;#39;s not   something that you cannot do anything about it \nis something that is the consequence of the way   you&amp;#39;re eating and the way you&amp;#39;re living and \nit&amp;#39;s not your fault okay the odds are stacked   against you all of the food accessible today \nis making our health worse and increasing this   diabetes number worldwide I&amp;#39;m going to give you \ninformation that&amp;#39;s going to help you actually be   able to navigate this complicated landscape \nand how do we know that type two diabetes is   not genetic we have a few different proofs first \nof all type two diabetes used to be called adult   onset diabetes it was called that way because \nonly adults would get it well today 5-year-old   children are getting this condition when that was \nnot the case at all and our genes have not changed   so much what has changed is what we&amp;#39;re eating and \nthe food environment so that&amp;#39;s clue number one   clue number two we know from scientific studies \nthat identical twins so people who have the exact   same DNA to the letter well if one twin has type \ntwo diabetes the other twin might not necessarily   have it it&amp;#39;s not like both twins always have \nit or both twins alwayss don&amp;#39;t have it it is   due to other factors so that&amp;#39;s another really \nimportant clue that one identical twin can have   type to diabetes and the other one cannot have \nit that means it is not 100% genetic and finally   and I think for me the most compelling piece of \nevidence is that hundreds of Studies have shown   us that if we change the way that we eat we can \nput our type 2 diabetes into remission now this   is the key if you&amp;#39;ve been diagnosed with diabetes \nyour only option is not to take medication for the   rest of your life if you&amp;#39;re willing and if you&amp;#39;re \nable to change how you&amp;#39;re eating you can put this   condition into remission now I know that for for a \nlot of people it&amp;#39;s really hard to Fathom changing   how we&amp;#39;re eating in our food habits and it seems \nlike something that is way too complicated and   Out Of Reach but don&amp;#39;t worry the stuff I&amp;#39;m going \nto share with you today is actually simple and   you&amp;#39;ll be able to do it it&amp;#39;s not a complicated \ndiet it&amp;#39;s not super restrictive it doesn&amp;#39;t ask   you to buy $35 smoothies we&amp;#39;re here for practical \neasy tips but first before we get into all of the   ways to solve it I want to give you guys a little \nbiology recap biology oneon-one on what is insulin   resistance and what is type two diabetes the \nmost important thing to remember that I think   probably you might not know yet is that insulin \nresistance is a spectrum and so we can measure   how insulin resistant anybody is at any moment \nyou can measure me you can measure yourself you   can measure your mom your sister your friend your \ncolleague you can measure insulin resistance at   any given moment when you&amp;#39;re not insulin resistant \nyou&amp;#39;re called healthy when you get more insulin   resistant you&amp;#39;re called pre-diabetic and when you \nget really insulin resistant then you&amp;#39;re called   type 2 diabetic then you have type 2 diabetes \nso insulin resistance and its spectrum is what   underpins whether or not you have a diagnosis \nlike pre-diabetes or type 2 diabetes so if you&amp;#39;ve   been diagnosed with insulin resistance well that \nmeans that you&amp;#39;re somewhere in that Spectrum maybe   you&amp;#39;re getting a little bit close to pre-diabetes \nso insulin resistance moves you can become more or   less insulin resistant depending on how you&amp;#39;re \nliving and the the objective is going to be to   become less of it so let&amp;#39;s back up even more \nwhat the heck is insulin why do we care what   is this insulin resistance thing okay so first \nfirst things first before we talk about insulin   we have to talk about glucose don&amp;#39;t worry it&amp;#39;s \ngoing to be easy glucose is your body&amp;#39;s favorite   source of energy okay every single part of your \nbody like my fingers that I&amp;#39;m moving right now my   mouth that I&amp;#39;m using to speak to you your brain \nas you&amp;#39;re listening to me they&amp;#39;re all burning   glucose for energy it&amp;#39;s the most important fuel \nin your body and the way that you give glucose   to your body so that you can have energy is by \neating Foods specifically by eating two types   of foods by eating starches so that&amp;#39;s bread pasta \nrice potatoes oats and by eating sugars by sugars   I mean anything that tastes sweet from an Apple \nto a slice of chocolate cake so when we eat these   starches of these sugars and they go into our \nmouth they then break down into glucose because   they contain glucose so when you eat starches \nor sugars they&amp;#39;re going to increase your glucose   levels in your body and after a meal if you ate \na lot of those foods and by the way those foods   are called carbs generally starches and sugars \nare called carbs if during a meal you eat a lot   of carbs then you&amp;#39;re going to experience what&amp;#39;s \ncalled a glucose Spike that means just a quick   delivery of glucose to your body and you could \nactually see this if you measuring your blood you   would see like a big spike like the one on this \ngraph right here so glucose spikes are a problem   they make us tired they make us have cravings \nthey inflame our body and most importantly for   our conversation today they lead to your body \nsending out insulin why does your body respond   to glucose spikes with insulin because your body \nknows that big glucose spikes are not good for it   and so it calls your pancreas and it&amp;#39;s like hey \npancreas can you please send out some insulin to   get that glucose Spike down so insulin arrives \nand grabs all the excess glucose and stores it   away in your liver in your muscles and in your \nfat cells so you might be wondering well how   is it possible that if glucose is the energy of \nmy body how is it possible that I could give my   body too much of it well it&amp;#39;s a bit like a plant \nso this plant on my desk right here I know that   it needs some water to live and survive but if \nI give the plant too much water then it&amp;#39;s going   to drown and die and the human body is the same \nsome glucose and it&amp;#39;s really happy but too much   glucose and problems start happening notably these \nglucose spikes so after a meal lots of carbs big   glucose Spike happens in your body insulin comes \nin grabs all the excess glucose and stores it away   into your cells so far so good okay now let \nme tell you a little story about when I was a   student cuz cuz I have to explain this next part \nso I grew up not drinking any coffee and then I   moved to London and I was studying mathematics \nand I had my very first coffee and let me tell   you that very first coffee of my life it kept me \nawake for a very long time I had a super hard time   going to bed that night I was wired it was crazy \nnow I started getting used to drinking coffee and   then 3 months later I needed like like three cups \nof coffee a day just to stay awake and I wondered   what&amp;#39;s going on how is it possible that just a \nfew months ago one cup of coffee was keeping me   awake for days basically and now I need three \ncups just to wake up in the morning and go to   class well what happened was that my body got used \nto the coffee my body gradually became resistant   to the coffee so I needed to give my body more \nand more coffee to get the same effect well with   insulin the same thing happens when there&amp;#39;s lots \nof insulin in your body for a long time your body   slowly becomes resistant to insulin just like \nwith the coffee it needs more and more insulin   to do the same thing and in this case it needs \nmore and more insulin to grab that glucose and   store it away in your cells so your body starts \nproducing more insulin but just like with coffee   if you start drinking more and more coffee you&amp;#39;re \ngoing to become more and more resistant to it and   you&amp;#39;re going to need more and more of it it&amp;#39;s \nkind of a vicious cycle in your body it&amp;#39;s the   same thing over time maybe a few months or years \nlater you&amp;#39;re going to need so much more insulin   to get that glucose out of circulation and into \nyourselves your body will have become resistant   to the insulin that is insulin resistance in a \nnutshell now what&amp;#39;s the consequence so let&amp;#39;s say   you keep eating the same way you&amp;#39;ve been eating \nso you&amp;#39;re eating carbs and they&amp;#39;re increasing your   glucose levels and you&amp;#39;re giving too much glucose \nto your body but maybe you don&amp;#39;t know it well   after a while because of this insulin resistance \ninsulin is just not working very well anymore and   it&amp;#39;s not able to grab all the excess glucose and \nstore it away so your glucose levels in your blood   they start to rise because the excess glucose is \nnot being disposed of as easily as before your   glucose levels in your blood start to rise and \nstart to increase and that is what is measured   at the doctor&amp;#39;s office once a year your doctor \nmeasures what&amp;#39;s called your fasting glucose level   basically your doctor tells you to come into the \ndoctor&amp;#39;s office first thing in the morning and it   and the doctor measures the amount of glucose in \nyour blood now if you&amp;#39;re eating in a way that&amp;#39;s   not causing too many glucose spikes you don&amp;#39;t \nhave a lot of insulin in the body you&amp;#39;re not very   insulin resistant your fasting glucose is going \nto be normal healthy it&amp;#39;s going to be like 85 or   90 but if you&amp;#39;ve been eating in a way that causes \nglucose spikes for a long time therefore there&amp;#39;s a   lot of insulin in your body Therefore your insulin \nresistance therefore glucose is rising your doctor   might notice that your fasting glucose level is \nhigh and here are the ranges that your doctor is   going to look at your doctor&amp;#39;s going to look at \nthe number so if your fasting glucose number is   underneath 100 your doctor&amp;#39;s going to tell you \nyou&amp;#39;re healthy you don&amp;#39;t have pre-diabetes you   don&amp;#39;t have diabetes if your fasting glucose number \nis between 100 and 126 your doctor is going to say   oh you&amp;#39;re pre-diabetic and if your fasting glucose \nlevel is a above 126 your doctor is going to say   you have type 2 diabetes and again this is just \na way of explaining how insulin resistant you   are because if you have high glucose level you \nalso have a lot of insulin resistance in your   body they go hand in hand in some countries uh \nthat number uses a different unit the fasting   glucose number so instead of using milligrams per \ndeciliter you might be using Mill moles per liter   and if if you&amp;#39;re using Mill moles per liter you \nwant your fasting glucose level to be underneath   5.5 to be normal it&amp;#39;s just a unit thing it&amp;#39;s like \nuh kilos and pounds but it&amp;#39;s the same concept now   why does it actually matter if you have a lot of \nfasting glucose level why is type 2 diabetes an   issue what&amp;#39;s really going on let me take you on \na little [Music] trip let&amp;#39;s go see I have sugar   cubes here to show you guys so what&amp;#39;s really \ninteresting is that in the body of a person who   has normal fasting glucose level so healthy this \nis the amount of sugar of glucose circulating in   their body it&amp;#39;s just one sugar cube it&amp;#39;s really \nnot that much now if somebody has Type 2 diabetes   do you know how much sugar they have circulating \nin their bloodstream one sugar cube and a half   the difference is Tiny between a healthy person \nand someone with type 2 diabetes this seems like   no no big difference right this seems like okay \nwell it&amp;#39;s just a tiny tiny increase in how much   glucose is circulating in your body between being \nhealthy and having type 2 diabetes but the thing   is this has huge consequences that tiny little \nincrease in how much glucose is circulating is   going to hurt your cells it&amp;#39;s going to inflame \nyour body it&amp;#39;s going to hurt your brain it&amp;#39;s   going going to create glycation it&amp;#39;s going to \ncause a whole bunch of issues and long term if   you&amp;#39;ve had type two diabetes for a long time \nthis can also lead to things like amputation   I mean this is a serious condition and we want \nto get that amount of glucose in your blood down   so that you don&amp;#39;t suffer the consequences so that \nwas the recap insulin resistance is a spectrum if   you have pre-diabetes or type two diabetes that \nmeans your insulin resistance is not great and   it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s pretty bad I know most doctors still \nrun just the fasting glucose test but actually   a better test is to run your fasting insulin \nlevel that is going to give you a sense of   your insulin resistance because insulin levels \nthey start Rising for years before your glucose   levels rise so if you want to detect insulin \nresistance and diabetes earlier measure your   fasting insulin levels in the description of this \nepisode I have a one pager that Rec caps all these   ranges all these tests that you can run Etc so \nthat if you want to have this all in one page   and show your doctor you can so have a look at \nthe link in the description of this episode now   if you have insulin resistance or type 2 diabetes \nyou might also have other things that are related   to all of this like polycystic ovarian syndrome \nor fatty liver disease so what do you do if you   have these conditions well as I explained it&amp;#39;s all \nbecause there&amp;#39;s too much insulin in your body so   we need to get that insulin down so that we get \nthat fasting glucose level down we need to give   less glucose to our body essentially so that your \nbody doesn&amp;#39;t need all this insulin and can slowly   reduce how much it&amp;#39;s producing so how do we \ngive our body less glucose well listen the most   important place to start is to look at these carbs \nbecause the carbs are what turn to glucose as we   digest them so have a look at how you&amp;#39;re eating \nare you eating mostly starches and sugars are you   eating mostly bread pasta pizza sodas granolas \nfruit juices candy if that&amp;#39;s the case you&amp;#39;re   giving a lot of glucose to your body all the time \nthere&amp;#39;s another free thing in the description of   this episode I have lots of stuff I&amp;#39;m going \nto give you it&amp;#39;s a big table that Recaps what   are starches what are sugars those increase your \nglucose levels and then what are proteins fats and   fibers and those do not increase your glucose \nlevels and those are the ones that you want   to eat more of and eat less of the carbs so for \nexample if you&amp;#39;re used to having in the morning   um a slice of toast with some jam on it and an \norange juice that&amp;#39;s basically 100% carbs that&amp;#39;s   going to lead to a lot of glucose and it&amp;#39;s going \nto make your diabetes or your insulin resistance   worse an alternative is to have something like a \nhot tea and some soft boiled eggs with a little   bit of sea salt on them or even a ham sandwich is \ngoing to contain less carbs than all of the other   sugary stuff that I just mentioned but have \na look at the food classification Master list   in the description of this episode to get started \nbut essentially you can totally do something about   your insulin resistance and your diabetes it&amp;#39;s \nnot a life sentence it&amp;#39;s not something you&amp;#39;re   born with it&amp;#39;s something that you are impacting \nwith the way that you&amp;#39;re eating every day and   if you&amp;#39;re wondering about the science there&amp;#39;s \na really interesting 2021 review that made it   very clear that the best way to reverse type two \ndiabetes is to flatten than your glucose curves   is to avoid those glucose spikes the study was \ncalled efficacy and safety of low and very low   carbohydrate diets for type 2 diabetes remission \nsystematic review and metaanalysis of published   and unpublished randomized trial data and in \nthis study they saw that diabetes remission   was observed in over 57% of participants at 6 \nmonths and we have so much evidence today that   now even the American Diabetes Association \nstarted endorsing diets that lead to smaller   glucose spikes as a really helpful way to put your \ndiabetes into remission this is your core option   it&amp;#39;s the most important thing to try to update \nhow you&amp;#39;re eating to get those glucose levels and   insulin levels down so let&amp;#39;s go over my glucose \nhacks that are going to help you get there in a   really easy way and before we start I just want to \nshow you something so over the past few few years   I&amp;#39;ve been synthesizing all the latest scientific \ndata into these 10 core principles that help get   those glucose levels down and help you put your \ndiabetes or insulin resistance into remission and   in my second book the glucose Godus method what I \ndid is that I recruited 3,000 people uh to follow   my hacks for four weeks and I measured the impact \nand just to show you something so I asked them   how it was going and I got a lot of data from \nthem there were a lot of people who joined who   had type 2 diabetes or insulin resistance and in \nthese four weeks by just adding four really simple   tips four really simple hacks 41% of people saw an \nimprovement in their diabetes and these hacks are   incredibly easy we&amp;#39;re talking about have a Savory \nbreakfast instead of a sweet one add vinegar once   a day before a meal add veggie starter to one of \nyour meals lunch or dinner and go for a 10-minute   walk after one meal a day we&amp;#39;re not talking about \nintense calorie counting I&amp;#39;m not talking about   super hardcore diets that you&amp;#39;re never going to be \nable to follow we need to find solutions that are   easy that integrate into your life that allow you \nto still eat the carbs that you like okay still   eat those starches and sugars with less impact \non your glucose levels so in the description of   this episode you can click and download a free \none page PDF summary of my 10 core glucose hacks   this is going to help you get started putting \nyour type two diabetes into remission or your   insulin resistance into remission I really want \nto leave you with this key piece of information   that these

    "transcript": "hello blood sugar Champions today we&amp;#39;re gonna talk about 25 superfoods that fixed my diabetes seriously since I&amp;#39;ve made changes to my eating habits and starting adding more and more of these Foods on my plate my hba1c went down from a catastrophic or 13.3 percent to 5.6 percent and my insulin sensitivity more than doubled I&amp;#39;ve lived with diabetes for 35 years and although I&amp;#39;m not a doctor nor a nutritionist and this is by no means medical advice based on my personal experience and my conversations with many other type 1 and type 2 diabetics I believe that these superfoods will help you tremendously regardless if you have type 1 type 2 diabetes pre-diabetes if you are trying to get your blood sugars under control on my top 25 superfoods list I have fruits veggies protein some special and exotic items so there is something for everyone we&amp;#39;ll go through the 25 superfoods right now and after that I will also talk about 10 harmful foods that unfortunately most diabetics are still eating and I think they shouldn&amp;#39;t but let&amp;#39;s go to my favorite foods first and start with fruits this video is sponsored by Ada one apple a day keeps the doctor away but not if you&amp;#39;re a diabetic or a pre-diabetic apples Spike blood sugar and that&amp;#39;s not what we want I will share with you other fruits that I like to eat some of them don&amp;#39;t Spike my blood sugar at all and some of them spike it just a little bit and very slowly which is exactly what we need during those more than 30 years with diabetes I tried all kinds of fruits and it was not easy to find these hidden gems I sorted them from the least favorites to the most favorites number five is grapefruit grapefruits are packed with vitamin C other antioxidants and they have very good dietary fiber content if you&amp;#39;re a type 2 diabetic or a pre-diabetic they can help you fight against insulin resistance and weight gain as well grapefruits are more than 90 percent water which makes them a great option for fresh juice to keep you hydrated they are very low in carbs with only 9 grams of net carbs per 100 grams and the glass index or GI is only 25 which is very low contributing to relatively minor and slow blood sugar spikes compared to other fruits grapefruit has great GI number and net carb number and these are really the two most important indicators when we are looking for blood sugar friendly fruits we want these numbers as low as possible but one problem many people have with grapefruit is that it&amp;#39;s too bitter if you&amp;#39;re like me you will probably find the bitter taste of a freshly squeezed grapefruit juice pretty refreshing but I&amp;#39;m sure many of you would like that juice to be sweeter I get that an easy and healthy way to make the juice from grapefruit sweeter is to add some Stevia which is a natural sweetener that won&amp;#39;t spike your glucose at all so try it out my fourth most favorite fruit are raspberries and blackberries berries in general have high levels of antioxidants fiber and vitamin C and raspberries and blackberries specifically have very sweet taste but they both only have 5 grams of net carb carbs per 100 grams the glycemic index is 32 for raspberries and only 25 for blackberries these are extremely friendly blood sugar numbers compared to other sweet fruits out there so raspberries and blackberries won&amp;#39;t cause that big sharp blood sugar Spike unless you eat way way too much of them I like to add berries in low carb smoothie or a breakfast bowl with some oats and low carb yogurt now speaking of berries I have one bonus fruit for you which in fact is considered superfood Goji berries this one is not so widely known but it&amp;#39;s one of the healthiest fruits with high levels of antioxidants that help regulate metabolism and protect your eyes which is a great benefit if you&amp;#39;re a diabetic 19 amino acids 21 trace minerals vitamin C vitamin E vitamins B loss of fiber and fatty acids now you need to go easy on Goji berries because unlike other fruits mentioned in this video These are very very sweet so they will spike your blood sugar a bit more but although they are so sweet they still have pretty reasonable numbers the glycemic index is only 29 and although they have 49 grams of carbs per 100 grams 19 grams of this is fiber which gets us to 30 grams of net carbs per 100 grams and I think they are well worth it at least for me a little hair in carbs but packed with all kinds of other good stuff they are mostly so dry and you can get them in most bigger supermarkets or healthy food stores they are great for snacking in small amounts if the dried ones are too hard for you you can just soak them in a bowl of water for a few minutes and they will soften very fast number three is coconut wait you say coconut is the fruit well I was thinking the same but according to healthline.com Coconut although it has the words not in the name is a fruit not a nut in fact they claim that coconut falls under a fruit called droops which are fruits that have an energy flesh and seeds surrounded by a heart shell other troops are peaches pears and even walnuts and almonds they apparently fall within the fruit category what do you think is coconut a fruit or a nut let me know in the comments anyhow coconut is great for diabetics because it doesn&amp;#39;t have a lot of carbs it&amp;#39;s mostly healthy fat it&amp;#39;s packed with fiber and iron and it only has 6 grams of net carbs per 100 grams of raw coconut and 7 grams per 100 grams of dry coconut the glycemic index is 42 which is quite high but because it has so little carbs the higher GI number is not such a big deal at least for me and you can find raw coconut in most tropical countries and a dried coconut in many supermarkets I love many coconut products coconut water as a refreshing drink or coconut milk that I include in many of my favorite recipes my second favorite fruit is guava guavas are another nutritious and very delicious tropical fruit some of them even call it superfood guavas are native to Central America and Northern South America but you can find them grown in some Asian countries and Southern U.S states there are several different kinds of guavas ripe guavas can be yellow green or red and the inner palp can vary in seed content and color from White all the way to dark pink I discovered guavas here in the north of Brazil where we have these dark pink ones I eat them unappealed and I eat the seeds as well this way of eating guavas proved to be very blood sugar friendly because I think the seeds and the pulp have a lot of fiber and honestly I think this way of eating any food is more blood sugar friendly guavas are great for snacking or as one of your components for your healthy smoothie not too sweet but delicious guavas are also rich in vitamin C A and B9 I found out that the southern American guavas have only 9 grams of net carbs per 100 grams and the glycemic index of 12. these are extremely good numbers even better than grapefruit and guava is not as bitter as grab food at all so that&amp;#39;s why it&amp;#39;s so high on my list guava has grown in Asia and Africa can have a higher GI around 30 and Indian guavas can have gi in the 70s so watch out for that because apparently fruits from different kind of the worlds can have different impacts on your blood sugars and my number one diabetes approved fruit is avocado botanically it is classified as a berry with a Single Seed so it is a fruit avocados are high in many vitamins minerals fiber and healthy unsaturated fats they are also super low in carbs compared to all other fruits with only 3 grams of net carbs per 100 grams and the glycemic index is only 15. the best thing about avocado is that it tastes so good so buttery but it is so healthy we&amp;#39;re gonna move from fruits now and talk about my favorite veggies that I call superfoods but if you liked any of the fruits please do me a favor and hit that like button to help this video reach more people these vegetables are not only healthy they are tasty they make me feel good and and most importantly they don&amp;#39;t Spike my blood sugar I personally eat each of them at least once a week let&amp;#39;s start with my favorite vegetable number seven and this veggie is very nutritious it has lots of antioxidants and vitamin A vitamin K and vitamin E is also rich in copper iron magnesium and other minerals it has 12 net carbs per serving so if you&amp;#39;re on a ketogenic diet for example you might want to keep that in mind and not eat more than one portion but if you&amp;#39;re optimizing for insulin sensitivity like I do these 12 net carbs are not a problem at all this veggie has a distinct red orange color and you can use it as a base for amazing creamy soup pasta sauce or just roast it in the oven you guessed it my favorite veggie number seven is pumpkin if you can&amp;#39;t find pumpkin in your store you can go with a butternut squash but pumpkin has less carbs and I find it a bit more tasty my favorite kind of pumpkin is Hokkaido and my favorite way to eat it is just roast it in the oven with a little bit of olive oil salt and Thyme I let it cool down and sprinkle it with some chia seeds the main reason why I sprinkle chia seeds over the pumpkin is to slow down the blood sugar Spike chia seeds are loaded with fiber and fiber slows down digestion which is what I want as a diabetic because that slows down that blood sugar Spike as well by the way the seeds of pumpkin are another diabetic superfood but more about that in another video moving on to my favorite veggie number six the main reason why I love this one is that it&amp;#39;s so versatile you can add it to almost any meal and instantly make it healthier this veggie is not as nutritious as pumpkin but despite that it&amp;#39;s rich in antioxidants vitamin A and C mananganese potassium and many other vitamins and minerals you absolutely don&amp;#39;t need to worry about this veggies packing your blood sugar because it has less than one net carb per serving it also has less than one gram of fat and less than one gram of protein and with only 17 calories per serving it&amp;#39;s a perfect candidate to be add to your menu if you&amp;#39;re trying to lose weight and yes my favorite veggie number six is zucchini my favorite way to eat zucchini not so long ago was to add them as one of my main ingredients to my chicken zucchini meatballs you can still find that recipe in one of my earlier videos on this channel but these days I&amp;#39;m mostly eating plant-based meals and I add zucchini to different soups plant-based stews plant-based meatballs and other meals zucchini don&amp;#39;t have a strong taste so you can add them to almost anything it&amp;#39;s a simple trick to make any meal healthier and less calorie rich or you can simply roast them in the oven with a bit of olive oil and herbs it&amp;#39;s so good but moving on to my favorite veggie number five we already have pumpkin which is orange zucchini which is green so we need to eat something red and yellow because what I&amp;#39;m going for here is diversity I want to have the Rainbow on my plate different colored plants are linked to higher levels of specific nutrients and specific health benefits and I want a balanced nutritious diet so variety of colors is very important to me my favorite veggie number five has a delicious sweet taste but not a lot of sugar only four net carbs per serving plus it&amp;#39;s super tasty very refreshing and full of white vitamins and antioxidants and you can use it in so many meals I&amp;#39;ll have a few ideas for you right here in a minute you probably figured out by now my favorite veggie number five is of course bell pepper one thing to watch out with bell peppers is that although one portion only have four net carbs these are mostly sugars so they can spike your blood sugar quite a bit if you eat a lot of bell peppers but my favorite way to eat peppers is to add them to a plant-based bean chili or this homemade quinoa salad which I showed in one of my previous videos from my experience when you combine bell peppers with beans green leaves and other high fiber ingredients you don&amp;#39;t need to worry about your blood sugar spiking too much and still enjoy that very sweet taste alright moving on to my favorite veggie number four and if you didn&amp;#39;t agree with me on my first veggie pumpkin then you will definitely not agree on this one because this one has a lot of carbs and carbs spike your blood sugar my favorite veggie number four is potatoes bear with me here for a minutes I want to explain why I don&amp;#39;t think potatoes are that bad and why I have them on my list a small serving of cooked potatoes has about 30 grams of carbs which is quite a lot and potatoes in general have a high glycemic index but potatoes are also considered healthy and nutritious food because they are rich in potassium and vitamin C for example so let me show you a few hacks how you can still enjoy the delicious Taste of potatoes without that annoying blood sugar Spike first of all pick the right kind of potatoes you want to look for potatoes with the lowest possible glycemic index potatoes with the lowest GI are Charisma or Nicola which both have gi below 60. another great option are sweet potatoes which also have lower glycemic index and sweet potatoes are more nutritious compared to normal potatoes don&amp;#39;t peel the potatoes keep the skin on because the skin has about half of the potatoes fiber content that fiber slows down digestion and helps prevent that blood sugar Spike another trick to make the potatoes more blood sugar friendly is to boil the potatoes first and cool them down in the fridge before eating them this step is super important because the cooling process creates resistant starch and resistant starch is very similar to fiber it&amp;#39;s something that slows the digestions of those carbs in the potatoes my absolute favorite way to eat cold potatoes is to make a potato salad mix the potatoes with green onions extra virgin olive oil Dijon mustard vinegar fresh parsley salt and pepper and it&amp;#39;s done and if you want to be a bit weird like me you can even sprinkle in some chia seeds for more fiber next up my favorite veggie number three this one is an absolute classic and a great option for both low carb eaters and Whole Food plant-based eaters this one is for everybody a cup of this green vegetable has only three and a half net carbs it also have two and a half grams of protein two and a half grams of fiber and with only 31 calories it&amp;#39;s again a great option for anyone who is trying to lose or maintain their weight this is literally loaded with vitamin C vitamin K and contains a long list of other vitamins and minerals you can see all of them on the screen right now you guessed it right my favorite veggie number three is broccoli and if you don&amp;#39;t like broccoli or if you can&amp;#39;t find it in your store on the day when you are shopping you can go for cauliflower these two have very similar quantities I personally go for broccoli because I&amp;#39;m going for that rainbow and cauliflower doesn&amp;#39;t have much color you can blanch broccoli in boiling water just for a couple minutes and serve as a side dish but my absolute favorite way to eat broccoli is to make a creamy healthy broccoli soup to make it you just boil your broccoli florets in salty water for about 10 minutes move the soup to the blender and mix it to a puree to finish this amazing soup just add a cup or two of warm almond milk and a generous amount of extra virgin olive oil still everything together and it&amp;#39;s done so simple to make so delicious and absolutely no blood sugar Spike from that soup you should definitely try this one out if you like broccoli now I have a feeling that my favorite veggie number two is going to be another controversial one I&amp;#39;ll tell you why in a minute but first let&amp;#39;s talk about why I love it so much this one is very nutritious you only need to eat a little bit of it and you get a lot of good stuff in your body there have been studies done that showed that this veggie can boost your immune system and you will be sick less often it contains vitamin C vitamin B6 selenium manganese and other beneficial components this veggie is very aromatic and you can use it to boost the taste of many meals without adding anything unhealthy if you&amp;#39;re guessing that my favorite veggie number two is garlic you are correct one glove of garlic is about one carb so it&amp;#39;s really easy to count if you count carbs I love garlic and the main reason why I said it&amp;#39;s controversial is because it&amp;#39;s so aromatic and I can imagine many people don&amp;#39;t want to eat garlic especially in the morning and then have a garlic breath for the rest of the day I don&amp;#39;t need to worry about it because I only talk to a camera by the way my favorite way to use garlic is to saute it with a little bit of extra virgin olive oil on a medium low heat this helps extract The Taste and the smell of garlic into the oil and makes the garlicky taste much less strong and this oil creates perfect base for many different soups sauces or stews before I get to my absolute favorite vegetable I have a bonus for you it&amp;#39;s a healthy blood sugar friendly side dish which is great for every occasion I learned how to make this salad dish in the north of Brazil where they call it vinegarage it&amp;#39;s also very popular in many Spanish-speaking countries where they call it pico de gallo a small portion of vinaigrette has only 17 calories and 2.5 net carbs which makes it a very low calorie blood sugar friendly dish it&amp;#39;s also loaded with vitamin C potassium and other good stuff and it&amp;#39;s super easy to make you just cut fresh tomatoes onion serrano peppers and lots of cilantro in very small pieces add lime juice and salt mix everything together and it&amp;#39;s done if you&amp;#39;re eating low carb then you can use this as a salad or sauce with the barbecue or grilled meat of any kind and if you eat Whole Foods plant-based like me it&amp;#39;s just a great all-around side dish and I always have a big bowl of vinaigrette in my fridge you can mix it with cooked quinoa corn avocado beans you can create so many salad options from vinaigrette now moving on to my favorite vegetable of them all and if you watch my channel before you probably know what my number one vegetable is because I also included it on my top 7 diabetes superfoods list here are the top 7 super foods that I think every diabetic should eat every day or if not every day then at least multiple times a week and let&amp;#39;s start with superfood number seven and if you watch my channel before then this one might come as a surprise to you because number seven is a kind of a seafood my superfood number seven is shrimp now obviously shrimp will not spike your blood sugar because it doesn&amp;#39;t have any carbs and its glycemic index is zero it&amp;#39;s low in calories relatively low in fat and high in protein but aside from that the main thing why I like shrimp is that it&amp;#39;s very nutrient dense food that means you don&amp;#39;t need to eat a big portion but you still get a high amount of protein and essential vitamins and minerals to your body Omega-3s vitamin D vitamin B12 and others I usually get raw shrimp that&amp;#39;s already been cleaned up couple minutes to grill them or saute them in a pan now there are many other Seafoods that have similar qualities as shrimp but the reason I picked shrimp is that it&amp;#39;s easy to make it&amp;#39;s tasty and you can get it almost everywhere my other Seafood picks that I absolutely love would be octopus and crab these are really tasty too but they are a bit more difficult to come by and that&amp;#39;s why they didn&amp;#39;t make the list but if you ever try grilled octopus or the sweet crab meat I guarantee you you will never want to go back moving on to diabetic superfood number six and this one probably won&amp;#39;t come as a surprise to you because I have glorified it on my channel before by the way when I was planning in this video I wanted to make sure that I fully understand what the term superfood means quite honestly it can mean different things to different people the widely acceptable definition is that superfoods are foods that offer maximum nutritional benefits for minimum calories They are packed with vitamins minerals and antioxidants and my superfood number six is a great example of this another nutrient dense food it&amp;#39;s a great source of fiber protein many important vitamins like folate and vitamin B1 and many important minerals like iron magnesium and a lot more and you guessed it right my superfood number six is black beans now to be honest some people in the diabetes Community will tell you that beans are rich in carbs they will spike your blood sugar and that&amp;#39;s why you should not eat them well let&amp;#39;s talk about it 100 grams of black beans which is a bit more than half a cup has 45 carbs sounds like a lot but we need to deduct 15 grams of fiber now we are at 30 net carbs this still might sound like a lot to some people but when we look at the glycemic index of black beans we will see that it&amp;#39;s only 30 which is very good when I eat black beans they almost never Spike my blood sugar a lot and if they pack it at all it&amp;#39;s a very slow steady Spike nothing to be concerned with what I love the most about beans is that when I eat high glycemic index foods like balls potatoes for example which would normally Skyrocket my blood sugar when I combine those burnt potatoes with black beans then my blood sugar will Spike much slower and much less I cannot quite scientifically explain this but it&amp;#39;s true it really happens that way for me a lot of time I cook my beans on my own but when I don&amp;#39;t have a lot of time I get beans in a can that&amp;#39;s okay too when I do that I always try to go for those with no added sugar fat and salt or at least rinse them to get rid of any added salt now there are other types of beans and other legumes that have similar qualities to beans and they could as well make it a list things like lentils chickpea or soybeans are also great the only thing that I would warming about when it comes to beans and legumes are those processed kinds of beans and other legumes that have more carbs and less fiber your blood sugar might go up quite fast after eating them and those are definitely not a superfood moving on to superfood number four and on our list we already have seafood beans and berries so we really need to add something green and my superfood number four is one of the most nutritious vegetables in the world it&amp;#39;s loaded with vitamin K1 vitamin A and vitamin C it&amp;#39;s a great source of Manganese magnesium potassium iron and calcium and if you guessed that my superfood number four is spinach you are absolutely correct spinach is a great nutrient dense food it only has 23 calories per 100 gram serving a little bit more than three carbs but 2 grams of fiber and 2 grams of protein and for these little calories is loaded with all those vitamins and minerals I found that the glycemic index of spinach is 15 but to be honest in real life I can eat as much spinach as I want and my blood sugar will not go anywhere now I might be a bit biased because I really love spinach my mom used to make it for me multiple times a week when I was a kid and I really loved it but I can imagine not all of you want to eat spinach every day and that&amp;#39;s okay great substitutes for spinach is kale but I guess that doesn&amp;#39;t help because kale is not very tasty I know so I would accept if you replace spinach or kale with some other green leafy vegetables and put it daily on your plate moving on to my superfood number three and this one might be a bit controversial because there are no reliable studies on this one yet this one is also quite new but I absolutely love it and I think it definitely belongs on the diabetes superfood list at least on mine I&amp;#39;m not a doctor I&amp;#39;m not a nutritionist I don&amp;#39;t provide medical advice so I guess I can put on my superfoods list whatever I want right this superfood comes from Peru it&amp;#39;s a great source of vitamin C vitamin B6 iron potassium and other important nutrients but that&amp;#39;s actually not the main reason why I added on this this list it&amp;#39;s also claimed to Boost energy and performance levels improve memory improve fertility in men and even be beneficial for women in menopause these are some big claims so let&amp;#39;s see what my superfood number three is and if it really can do all these things my superfood number three is Peruvian macaroot and I&amp;#39;m gonna get very personal now I previously struggled with weak memory and decreased sexual appetite and to be honest I blame diabetes for these things and for doing the damage over the past 35 years I decided to try my car what I did is I started adding one teaspoon of this 100 natural maca powder to my breakfast bowl and after a month of doing this my memory and my energy levels didn&amp;#39;t really go anywhere they stayed the same but my sexual appetite improved a lot now I don&amp;#39;t want to get too deep into this topic because this channel really is about diabetes it should not be about my bedroom Adventures but I&amp;#39;m telling you this stuff really worked for me and that&amp;#39;s why I had to add it on my super foreign list and I hope it will help some of you too moving on to my superfood number two we already have seafood beans berries spinach maca root so I feel we need to add something that has great taste and something that will bring some healthy fats on our plate another nutrient dense food that has such a wide variety of beneficial nutrients look at the vitamins K1 folate vitamin C and many others and the minerals potassium copper magnesium and again many others I think most of you already know what it is my superfood number two is avocado now avocado is not exactly low in calories it&amp;#39;s very rich in fat and although these are all healthy fats avocado is a little bit more calorie rich food when you compare it to others on this list but I still think it&amp;#39;s a great choice for diabetics because it only has 17 carbs offset by 14 grams of fiber so only three net carbs per 100 grams and the glycemic index of avocado is also very low around 15. and I can confirm that my blood sugar doesn&amp;#39;t Spike at all after eating avocado and I like to add a homemade avocado salad or guacamole to many of my plates I&amp;#39;ll give you one tip I prefer this big light green avocados I think they are called quintals they taste more fresh and juicy than the small dark avocados and I think they have less calories too moving on to the next superfood for diabetics and this one my friend is the number one superfood on my list before I get to it I want to remind you how you can get in touch with me if you wanted to you can sign up for my patreon site and you can message with me one-on-one what you can also do is book a coaching session with me I really enjoyed those coaching sessions that we already had with some of you I talked with many of you about different topics diet blood sugar management diabetes technology and I would love to talk to more of you feel free to reach out on patreon or on my website links are down below now I&amp;#39;m sure my number one super food will not come as a surprise to those of you who have been watching my channel regularly because I I brought it up already a few times this food has five main benefits it&amp;#39;s packed with fiber it helps make you feel full and reduces appetite it helps support weight loss it&amp;#39;s a great source of omega-3 fatty acids just like avocado and it helps reduce post-meal blood sugar spikes and I&amp;#39;m sure you already know what it is of course chia seeds wait ax didn&amp;#39;t make the list no they didn&amp;#39;t and I&amp;#39;m gonna tell you why right after I tell you a bit more about chia seeds the main reason why I love chia seeds is that they are loaded with fiber and when I add them to any meal they will basically slow my blood sugar Spike from that meal it works for me every time so I tend to add them to almost anything it&amp;#39;s crazy I know but it really works look at that one ounce or 28 gram portion of chia seeds has 12 carbs and 10 grams of fiber when I did a bit of research I realized that when I soak or ground the chia seeds the body can absorb more of the nutrient so I try to do that another great alternative to chia seeds are flags but flax seeds always need to be ground otherwise the body will not be able to process them now enough about chia seeds and flax seeds let&amp;#39;s talk about ax because I know eggs are a sensitive topic for many of you so X didn&amp;#39;t make my top 7 superfood list but keep in mind this list is very subjective I&amp;#39;m not a doctor I&amp;#39;m not a nutritionist and I selected and ranked my superfoods based on my personal preference but I have to admit that I have been wrong about X before in one of my videos I said that eggs are one of the 10 harmful foods that diabetics keep eating and many of you disagreed with me and let me know quite loudly in the comment section that eggs are not harmful that video I said exactly this about 60 percent of calories in eggs come from fat eggs are also loaded with cholesterol about 200 milligrams for an average sized egg that&amp;#39;s more than double the amount of cholesterol in a Big Mac and you guessed it saturated fat and cholesterol contribute to potential essential for heart disease which is one of the potential complications when you have diabetes and one of the things you might want to be careful about now after doing some more research about eggs I realized that I have been clearly wrong too radical about saturated fats and cholesterol in eggs the dietary cholesterol in eggs is apparently not a problem because our body needs cholesterol our brain need cholesterol it&amp;#39;s never been proven that the dietary cholesterol in eggs automatically converts into the bad cholesterol and blood which would be a problem so I want to apologize for that mistake and I want to let you know that I no longer think that eggs are bad for diabetics actually after doing that research on eggs I can easily imagine they could make someone else&amp;#39;s list of top diabetes superfoods eggs are great source of many important nutrients vitamins and minerals they increase satiety levels clearly they don&amp;#39;t Spike blood sugar because they have zero carbs and the glycemic index of zero which is great for diabetics and the main point I was trying to make in that previous video which clearly didn&amp;#39;t come out the way I planned was that frying eggs or scrambling eggs in all every morning and eating them with bacon sausage or some other processed ingredients is not healthy eggs just like any other superfood I talked about in this video are healthy on their own but if you fry them in oil which is highly processed fat or if you covered them with refined sugar then the superfood no longer is a superfood because you will be consuming all the calories from that processed oil and processed sugars by the way why don&amp;#39;t we look at those 10 harmful foods that most diabetics are still eating right now I made this video because I saw many diabetics either eating or being recommended to eat these stand foods but guys no matter if you are type 1 diabetic type 2 or pre-diabetic you might want to cut down on some of these things here is why let&amp;#39;s start with the most harmful food number 10 and it&amp;#39;s very interesting because number 10 is very healthy in its natural form but we often consume it fried salted or even with some fancy coating that has added sugar you guessed it number 10 are nuts wait did you think nuts are healthy well yeah nuts are a great source of protein healthy fats like Omega-3s fiber and minerals there is no question about that but you need to have them in their raw form don&amp;#39;t eat those with added sugar which will spike your blood glucose processed fats in which they are often fried and all the sodium from added salt it&amp;#39;s not so difficult to find all kinds of nuts in their natural form in the supermarket don&amp;#39;t buy them at the gas station or some other Quick Stop place because these often have the unhealthy ones moving on to most harmful food number nine another one that sounds quite healthy but in fact it&amp;#39;s very problematic for diabetics by the way I sorted these items from the least harmful to the most harmful so the one that in my opinion is the worst come at the very end as number one and the order is based on my personal experience and my subjective opinion keep in mind I&amp;#39;m a type 1 diabetic I&amp;#39;m not a doctor and not a dietitian number nine is fruit juice now did you think fruit juice was healthy well it is a freshly squeezed orange juice is packed with vitamin C and that&amp;#39;s a great thing but it will spike your blood sugar extremely fast because it&amp;#39;s loaded with carbs and carbs Spike blood sugar this is kind of a problem if you are a diabetic and yeah oranges Spike blood sugar quite fast because they have high glycemic index and if you squeeze only they choose from them you will get rid of most of the fiber that was in the whole orange and the blood sugar will Spike even faster and that&amp;#39;s why I&amp;#39;m not a big fan of juices I prefer smoothies you can still get all the good stuff from the fruits when you blend them in a blender and if you combine fruits with hieroglycemic index with fruits with lower glycemic index like berries in your smoothie the blood sugar spec will become much more manageable and my secret weapon that I add to my smoothie are chia seeds or flax seeds these are loaded with fiber and slow down digestion which will slow down dead blood sugar Spike as well other things you can add are avocado Greek yogurt or coconut milk because these things are high in fat and that fat also slowers the blood sugar Spike because it locks the carbs and doesn&amp;#39;t let them in the bloodstream so fast so don&amp;#39;t be afraid of all the fruits and try some of the tips I&amp;#39;m sharing in this video instead and see how your blood sugar reacts these tips work perfectly fine for me but again it&amp;#39;s just my personal experience the seventh most harmful food is a huge problem for me because I&amp;#39;m absolutely addicted to this thing and although I know number seven is not good for me I just can&amp;#39;t stop consuming it actually I did stop once for a 30 day or even a bit longer and I made a video about it on this channel but now I&amp;#39;m back at it unfortunately and I can&amp;#39;t stop I just can&amp;#39;t stop I&amp;#39;m addicted and if you&amp;#39;ve been watching my channel for a while you know what I&amp;#39;m talking talking about it&amp;#39;s diet soda oh my God it tastes so good this one looks really innocent at the beginning because if you&amp;#39;re diabetic it makes a lot of sense to drink diet coke or Coke Zero instead of regular Coke it doesn&amp;#39;t have any added sugar right so it must be better but it includes a lot of additives and artificial ingredients including sweeteners these ingredients are full of unnatural chemicals that can cause your body to crave more sweet Foods in general and might lead to overeating which I can kind of see on myself and in my case another side effect of drinking way too much diet soda is that it ruined my teeth I lost most of the animal from my teeth which will cost me a lot of pain and a lot of money very soon I reached a point where I need to have a major procedure done really soon to basically add porcelain veneer on each of my teeth this is a thin shell that&amp;#39;s custom made so you can imagine this will not be cheap so stop drinking diet right so that if you still can this one is not up for discussion I regret getting this addiction number six is another one that is commonly consumed within the diabetes community and often considered healthy although it&amp;#39;s not number six is Muslim bars most of these healthy bars have added sugar which will obviously Skyrocket your blood sugar and if they don&amp;#39;t have added sugar they will probably have other processed ingredients which are simply not so good for you now I&amp;#39;m not saying that you can&amp;#39;t eat Misty bars at all at the end you can eat anything you want right but I personally would look really carefully at the label when buying those and try to go for those without added sugar and with the lowest possible amount of ingredient and maybe also high in fiber not necessarily mystery bars lowest in the carbohydrate count but lowest in the ingredient count because the less ingredients the bar has the more natural and healthy it usually is it&amp;#39;s not scientifically proven but it&amp;#39;s a rule of thumb I use and I get it most of you will anyway want to always look at the carb count because carbs are the thing that Spike our blood sugar so I totally get it but keep in mind that it&amp;#39;s not always only about the carbs now I&amp;#39;m sure that for the most harmful food number five on my list I will get in trouble because more than one third of you selected exactly this one as your favorite on my community tab the most harmful food number five is steak and I used to eat a lot of steak and beef in general but I recently cut down on these things for similar reason why I cut down on eggs although steak doesn&amp;#39;t have any carbohydrates it&amp;#39;s quite high in saturated fats and cholesterol so not spiking my blood sugar immediately but definitely not healthy and potentially triggering other issues like the heart disease we already talked about now I totally get it when you want to go out for dinner as a diabetic it&amp;#39;s definitely a lot easier to go to a steakhouse and have a steak with salad rather than going to some Asian or Italian place because these places are guaranteed to spike your blood sugar to the moon in the steakhouse you can get a really blood sugar friendly dinner steak with salad has almost no carbs but eating too much steak consuming too much saturated fats will negatively impact your insulin sensitivity no matter what type of Diabetes you have moving on to the most harmful food number four and I hope my wife is not watching because she loves to invite family and friends for a Sunday afternoon coffee and cake and the coffee and a cake kinds of foods like donuts muffins cakes and your 580 calories and 95 carb mocha cookie crumble Frappuccino from Starbucks are loaded with sugar there is literally nothing healthy or blood sugar friendly in them and they will simply spike your blood sugar to the mood many of the things I&amp;#39;m talking about here will spike your blood sugar to the moon so I probably said that already five times in the video but it&amp;#39;s true now again I&amp;#39;m not saying that you cannot have a cup of black coffee in the morning to get you started because that&amp;#39;s exactly what I do but keep in mind that even black coffee can spike your blood sugar because of the caffeine that stimulates your body and the blood sugar just naturally goes up plus studies show that caffeine stays in your body for 16 hours and so if you drink coffee or any other caffeinated beverages in the afternoon it will certainly impact negatively impact the quality of your sleep and quality of your sleep has direct impact on longevity so if you want to live longer take care of your blood sugars and get a good sleep don&amp;#39;t drink too much caffeine I will definitely try with my diet coke Addiction in terms of cakes donuts and muffins I am way stricter and I would suggest that you simply avoid those like I do and if you really love cakes and just can&amp;#39;t live without them then maybe check a video that I will link down there where I shared some of the tips for friendly diabetes baking the most harmful item number three is pizza and fast food this one is an evergreen I hear so many diabetics especially those who are insulin dependent talking about how difficult it is to get the right dose of insulin and time it correctly when eating a pizza or a burger with fries and the reason why it is so difficult is that these kind of meals kind of spike your blood sugar twice they are high in carbs literally loaded with processed flour in the pizza dough or the burger bun and these carbs naturally spike your blood sugar really fast but the other thing is that these fast food items are also full of processed fats potato fries fried burger or the pizza toppings with ton of cheese these processed fats are not only extremely bad for your cholesterol but they also delay some of the blood sugar Spike the fats simply lock the carbs and they will release them to your bloodstream as late as few hours after you ate those meals and that&amp;#39;s why you might see your blood sugar spiking all night after eating a pizza for dinner another prime example of such food that causes intense and very long lasting blood sugar Spike the milkshake from McDonald&amp;#39;s or that Starbucks mocha cookie crumble Frappuccino or whatever it&amp;#39;s called which I mentioned a few minutes ago now I get it it&amp;#39;s super challenging to completely avoid fast food and eliminate it from our lives because we have limited amount of time time and it&amp;#39;s convenient to get fast food plus all these chains are making their food extremely addictive the meals are extremely addictive they are made that way so that you come again to the McDonald&amp;#39;s so that you come again to whatever chain you go to but moving on to the most harmful food number two and I&amp;#39;m sure this will be another controversial one and I know many of you will disagree with me but I simply have to say it because I see many diabetics doing a low carb diet which is not necessarily wrong but they are eating way too much of this as part of the low carb diet the second most harmful food on my list is deli meats things like bacon salami ham and similar things and I know it&amp;#39;s super easy to justify eating these because I had eaten way too much of them myself thinking they are perfectly fine for me because they don&amp;#39;t Spike my blood sugar at all and I can eat even large quantities of them and my blood sugar levels will just be fine and I became addicted just like with diet cook I caught myself eating at least one package and these were not small packages of deli meat every day my favorite was Mortadella but similar to other things we already talked about deli meats are full of saturated fats extremely high in sodium and they are addictive this is not only bad because of cholesterol and heart disease but if you&amp;#39;re saturated fat intake especially from processed foods is too high it will negatively impact your insulin sensitivity and you will need more insulin and that&amp;#39;s regardless of what kind of diabetes you have to be clear because when I cut back on some of those things I can also cut back on my insulin intake as a type 1 diabetic without actually changing the amount of carbs that I eat before I get to the number one most harmful food that most diabetics are still eating please do me a favor and hit that like button if you are getting value of this video and turn on all the notifications by clicking that Bell next to the Subscribe button and that way you will be notified anytime I

according to World Health Organization and of course it&amp;#39;s cigarettes and alcohol the thing is avoiding those 10 harmful foods and adding some of those superfoods I talked about today on your daily menu it&amp;#39;s just the first step on your successful diabetes Journey but there is more you need to do to get those blood sugars where you want them to be so if you want to lower your blood sugar immediately and avoid the risk of future diabetes complications click on the video on the screen right now in that video I share all I know about lowering blood sugars and how I did that go

    "transcript": "medications that make you diabetic or make diabetes worse be aware have you ever been taking medications for a while and then all of a sudden your blood glucose levels were higher than normal well this could be because some medicines can cause this hi I&amp;#39;m Dr ahmedan I&amp;#39;m an endocrinologist and a diabetes specialist today we are talking about meds that can give you diabetes sometimes diabetes might go away on its own but in some cases it doesn&amp;#39;t which means that if we don&amp;#39;t stop giving these type of pills or injections soon enough permanent diabetes may result so today I will explain how each medication type can cause diabetes Now if you must continue taking the medication that caused your diabetes it may make your controlling your diabetes more difficult than normal so if you&amp;#39;re able to discontinue the medication your blood glucose levels may become a lot easier to manage now of course following a healthy diet and meeting the recommended exercise guidelines will help you manage your blood levels much better if yourse comes to worse right and we have to also reduce the risk of diabetes and high blood sugar levels by taking the medication in lesser dosages if possible or for a shorter length of time you may be prescribed a lower dose of medication in an effort to prevent issues like diabetes from rising hopefully but if not talk to your doctor if you have a higher chance of acquiring type two diabetes you may want to talk to your doctor about that how that medication or dosage may actually increase your risk of developing the diabetes like steroids for example so we&amp;#39;re going to talk about that first corticosteroids are really potent class of drugs that are used to treat a variety of illnesses because of inflammation like rheumatoid arthritis it could be lupus there&amp;#39;s many other diseases now steroids can be in the form of creams inhalers pills infusions or injections so it is possible that cortical steroids will actually cause an increase in blood glucose levels even without diabetes which will then return to normal after the steroid therapy is completed however particularly if cortical steroids are used for a prolonged amount of time steroid treatment can sometimes result in the development of type two diabetes that is irreversible in some cases so if you are already a diabetic it is very possible that you will need to take insulin while taking steroid medication because high do steroids such as the one to treat COPD or knee injections will Skyrocket your blood sugar now following the completion of your steroid course of treatment you may be able to switch to a less potent diabetic prescription or even discontinu your blood glucose lowering medication completely now we&amp;#39;re going to talk about the beta blockers next such as atenolol carvol metool and so forth in order to lower blood pressure and heart rate beta blockers work by inhibiting the release of adrenaline and neuro adrenaline from the body now patients with an angina heart disease or high blood pressure they may be prescribed beta blockers to help them manage their symptoms now beta blockers on the other hand can impair the insulin sensitivity they can increase the likelihood of developing type 2 diabetes especially in the long term the next is thide diuretics such as hydrochlorizide these are medicines that help the body flush the water out of the body they&amp;#39;re called diuretics thite diuretics Etc some people call them water tablets they can be used to lower the blood pressure or remove the extra water from the body they can also be used to help lose weight and so forth but the side effects of taking tiroide diuretics is a lot and one of them is high blood sugar levels and you can have low levels of salt in your body like sodium levels can go down so magnesium and potassium can go down as well if you stop taking thite diuretics your blood sugar actually m but not always go back to normal next is cholesterol medication stattin now before we get into that if you&amp;#39;re enjoying this video and learning something please click on the thumbs up subscribe and share the content let&amp;#39;s go back to our topic statins are a class of drugs that are commonly used to treat high cholesterol as you must know they work by inhibiting the enzyme HMG COA reductase which is required for body to produce cholesterol now stat pons were first introduced in 2003 and they have since been prescribed to millions and millions of people around the world in 2011 a study published in JMA medical journal showed a link between taking higher doses of stat and medications and the higher risk of type two diabetes this finding led to FDA the US Food and Drug Administration introducing warnings on stattin in 2012 advising on the higher risk of blood glucose levels and memory problems associated with the medication while statins are still widely prescribed it is important to be aware of the potential risks that are associated next on my list is anti psychotics antipsychotics are a type of medication that are used to treat schizophrenia and other mental health conditions while they can be effective in managing symptoms they can also have some potential side effects like weight gain they&amp;#39;re actually horrible with the weight gain and blood sugar levels as a result will go up so if you&amp;#39;re taking antis psychotics it is important to monitor your weight and blood sugar levels very closely If you experience any significant changes speak to your doctor about adjusting your dosage or discontinuing the medication now while these antipsychotics may cause temporary side effects if they are taken for an extended amount of time some of the effects such as diabetes may become permanent so therefore it is is really important to weigh the risks and the benefits of taking the antic psychotics before starting a new medication regimen the most dangerous atypical antic psychotics for diabetes are Thorazine clopine olanzapine resperidone and Quine are typically these are atypical antipsychotics with a moderate risk of diabetes now there are some of them are like ceril some anti psychotics are low risk for diabetes such as Abilify or arol or zi ridone Etc last on my list is BR control pills they do not necessarily cause diabetes but will definitely make you more insulin resistant and if you already have diabetes your blood sugar actually may go up after starting bir control pills so that&amp;#39;s it if you think this video helped you make sure you subscribe that will prevent missing any of our videos that is publish three times a week stay happy stay healthy you will see you in the next video

    "transcript": "hi I&amp;#39;m Dr Jason fun welcome to the diabetes code clinic this is part one of six where we&amp;#39;re focused on type 2 diabetes remission and we&amp;#39;re going to go over today what type 2 diabetes is how to think about this important disease and how that leads us really to a strategy of reversing it and it&amp;#39;s coming right [Music] up if you were to ask skinbody is type 2 diabetes reversible well up till about 2022 the universal answer would have been no all the major associations such as diabetes Canada the American Diabetes Association put right on their website that no it&amp;#39;s not reversible they said for example type 2 diabetes is a progressive lifelong disease which means that once you had it you had it for life and there was nothing you could do about it they put on their website too that you should do things like stop smoking you should watch your blood pressure and those are important things but they really didn&amp;#39;t mention the single most important thing which is changes to your diet I wrote The Diabetes code in 2018 and I argued that this was clearly just a lie that this was Progressive and chronic in fact it was reversible and everybody already knew it everybody knew that if you lost weight or you changed your diet often the type 2 diabetes would get better or go away completely and by 2023 that lie was simply not sustainable so diabetes Canada as well as other associations finally admitted that type 2 diabetes can be put into remission and if it can be reversible then that should be our goal not simply to give medications to control this disease but to actually eradicate it and get rid of this disease and the American ameran Diabetes Association said much the same thing up until 2022 or so they said well the most important thing is to take your medicines but really the most important thing is to watch your diet after the publication of the diabetes code a lot of uh readers started to follow some of the advice and Readers Digest uh published a group of people who had done so well they completely reverse their type 2 diabetes doing this one thing and that thing of course is watching the diet adding intermittent fasting and also cutting down the carbohydrates and you can see from these pictures that some of these people really had spectacular success and funny enough none of their doctors none of their health professionals were the ones to give them that advice they got it instead from online sources and a book to really watch your diet there&amp;#39;s a really important difference between type one and type 2 diabetes and I want to stress that this is for type two diabetes type 1 diabetes is really a completely separate disease if you compare the two type one typically affects younger patients and type two typically affects older people adults type 1 diabetes is less common type 2 diabetes comprises about 95% of diabetes in adults type one diabetes tends to be fairly sudden and type two tends to be gradual in type 1 diabetes people tend to be Slimmer and type two diabetes they tend to be overweight or obese and most importantly type 1 diabetes which is an autoimmune disease is a progressive disease but type 2 diabetes is a reversible dietary disease so what is Type 2 diabetes really it is a dietary disease and as a dietary disease you have to make sure you fix the diet you can&amp;#39;t simply take more drugs because if you&amp;#39;re taking drugs for a dietary disease well you&amp;#39;ll never fix the problem because you never identified the problem in the first place in type two diabetes the entire disease can be understood that your body simply has too much sugar so think about a sugar bowl sugar is what your body uses for energy this includes not just the sugar like table sugar which is sucrose but also carbohydrates starches like bread and rice and pasta are actually composed of long chains of glucose which is a type of sugar and when you eat it your body can then use some of that sugar or glucose for energy and that&amp;#39;s for your heart and your liver and your brain and so on and every day when you eat you&amp;#39;re going to put a little bit of sugar into your body which is your sugar bowl and when you don&amp;#39;t eat when you fast when you&amp;#39;re sleeping for example your body&amp;#39;s going to use some of that sugar so a little bit goes in and a little bit goes out every single day what happens then over many decades if you&amp;#39;re just putting in a little bit more sugar than you&amp;#39;re taking out well over time that Sugar Bowl is going to fill up at some point it reaches the sit situation where it&amp;#39;s completely full now the next time you eat and put a little bit of sugar into that bowl well it&amp;#39;s overflowing so it&amp;#39;s going to spill out that means the glucose that you eat is going to spill out into the blood when you see that high blood glucose that&amp;#39;s when you get diagnosed with type 2 diabetes but the important thing is to understand that it wasn&amp;#39;t the high blood glucose that is really important it&amp;#39;s that the Sugar Bowl has been full there&amp;#39;s too much much sugar in your whole body and you can&amp;#39;t simply fix the uh the sugar that&amp;#39;s Spilled Out you can&amp;#39;t just simply wipe it away because that Sugar Bowl still full the next time you eat you&amp;#39;re going to put more sugar in it&amp;#39;s going to spill out again you haven&amp;#39;t solved the problem the only way to put the type 2 diabetes into remission which is that Sugar Bowl that&amp;#39;s too full is to start to empty it out and if your body has stored way too much sugar over time this explains why type 2 diabetes affects every single organ in the body which is unlike virtu any other disease that we take care of because if your body has too much sugar well all your organs are simply going to rot away not immediately but over 5 10 15 years so type 2 diabetes is the leading cause of heart attacks it&amp;#39;s leading cause of Strokes it&amp;#39;s the leading cause of amputations bad infections kidney failure blindness all of these organs are affected because there&amp;#39;s simply too much sugar in your body and it&amp;#39;s rotting away it&amp;#39;s not necessarily the sugar that&amp;#39;s in your blood but the one that&amp;#39;s in your body and understanding this is very important because then it leads you to the solution if you&amp;#39;ve got an overflowing Sugar Bowl well how do you reverse that there&amp;#39;s only two things you need to think about about one how can you put less sugar into the body one way would be to Simply restrict your calories that can certainly be effective but there&amp;#39;s a more effective way because calories um are not all the same our foods are composed of one of three macronutrients carbohydrates proteins and fats carbohydrates are sugar but proteins are amino acids IDs and fats are fatty acids so when you eat a certain number of calories and it&amp;#39;s all from carbohydrates you&amp;#39;re putting a lot of sugar into your body if you eat an egg or a piece of chicken for example you&amp;#39;re eating proteins and fats but no sugar so therefore when you eat the uh chicken for example your blood sugar does not go up even though you&amp;#39;re taking calories so reducing the amount of carbohydrates you take can be very effective strategy for reversing type 2 diabetes and the other way to reverse type 2 diabetes is to give your body the time it needs to burn it off because remember when you&amp;#39;re eating you&amp;#39;re putting sugar in when you&amp;#39;re not eating you&amp;#39;re burning off that sugar for energy so if you extend the period where you&amp;#39;re not eating which is fasting then you&amp;#39;re going to allow your body to naturally burn off all this excess sugar as you empty out that Sugar Bowl the next time you put sugar in it&amp;#39;s not going to spill out and therefore your type 2 diabetes just got better what&amp;#39;s the first step well before we get to low carb diets and intermittent fasting which we&amp;#39;re going to talk about in later sessions you need to know what&amp;#39;s happening in your body and so therefore it&amp;#39;s important to monitor your glucose there&amp;#39;s two ways you can do this you can do it with the traditional finger sticks or you can use um a continuous glucose monitor both are very effective and if you&amp;#39;re on medication it&amp;#39;s doubly important to make sure you monitor it so that you don&amp;#39;t get into problems with uh sugars that are too high or too low as you adjust your diet the second thing is a food journal so a food journal is simply something simple that tracks what you&amp;#39;re eating and what happens to your blood glucose because you got to remember one thing some foods are going to raise your blood glucose and some foods are not going to raise your blood glucose and the only way you&amp;#39;re going to know is to test it for yourself you can look online to see which uh Foods typically affect the blood glucose and those are mostly the refined carbohydrates because remember carbs are sugar you eat sugar your blood sugar goes up but it actually doesn&amp;#39;t tell tell you anything about how your own body responds and so this personalization allows you to really fine-tune what&amp;#39;s happening in your own body you want to eat more of the foods that don&amp;#39;t raise your blood glucose and eat less of the foods that do raise your blood glucose so that&amp;#39;s a start that&amp;#39;s how you have to think about type 2 diabetes the key messages here is that type 2 diabetes is reversible dietary disease reversible means that that should be our goal to get rid of this disease dietary means that you have to focus on the diet there&amp;#39;s no way around it number two type 2 diabetes is a disease of too much sugar in your body when we&amp;#39;re talking about sugar we&amp;#39;re talking about not just the sugar that you see like table sugar but also starchy Foods potatoes rice bread which are carbohydrates and car carbohydrates are chains of glucose they are sugar and you&amp;#39;ve got too much in of it in the body not just in the blood and number four observe your sugars and your Foods in a food journal and that&amp;#39;s how you&amp;#39;re going to personalize the diet to your own physiology thanks for watching Everybody I&amp;#39;ll see you next time",

    "transcript": "there are quite a few nighttime signs of diabetes that you should know about and it&amp;#39;s very important to recognize what your body&amp;#39;s trying to tell you because so many people ignore these signs and they end up having more damage with your organs especially the kidneys the first one is getting up frequently at night urinating this is called noctua you have too much sugar in your blood and the kidneys filter the blood and the body is naturally trying to get rid of this excess sugar because it&amp;#39;s toxic and the other thing to know is that wherever the sugar goes water goes with it and so as it&amp;#39;s getting rid of the sugar it&amp;#39;s also getting rid of your fluids making you dehydrated I remember in practice one guy uh was getting up and I&amp;#39;m not kidding 10 times a night I mean talk about a symptom that can destroy your life because he was so tired all day long and I told him this symptom was completely unnecessary we told him what to do which I&amp;#39;m going to tell you what to do and this device corrected the problem within 3 days and he was able to sleep through the night from there on out and so this leads us with the number two which is excessive thirst now of course being a diabetic you&amp;#39;re going to be dehydrated so you&amp;#39;re going to constantly need water to hydrate yourself but the other thing to realize that when you&amp;#39;re a diabetic or you have high sugar you&amp;#39;re also naturally going to retain sodium and so if your body is going to hold this salt it&amp;#39;s also going to need more water and so you have this feedback loop where you&amp;#39;re drinking all this water you&amp;#39;re urinating excessively which then creates dehydration caus you to drink more and this keeps going around and round and round when you&amp;#39;re getting rid of the water you&amp;#39;re also getting rid of potassium magnesium calcium but for some reason you tend to retain more sodium okay the next symptom is restless leg syndrome I had this and of course I was consuming a pint of Ben and&amp;amp; Jerry&amp;#39;s every single night for over a year little did I know all that sugar was depleting a key vitamin called B1 when you&amp;#39;re deficient in B1 you start building up a lot of what&amp;#39;s called lactic acid in your muscles where your muscles won&amp;#39;t get the oxygen and it becomes is very very fatigued and so you don&amp;#39;t want lactic acid build up in your muscles when you&amp;#39;re sleeping because you&amp;#39;re going to feel very restless you&amp;#39;re not going to have the oxygen in your legs and so your legs are just going to feel very energetic another connection with this restless leg is a magnesium deficiency which you nearly always see with people with high blood sugars and without magnesium the muscles cannot feel relaxed and be calm it&amp;#39;s a B1 and magnesium deficiency because the person is usually consuming too many refined carbs or sugars and so they can take a lot of bwan and temporarily feel better but unless they get rid of the sugars uh it just keeps coming back now the next symptom does relate to restless leg syndrome but it&amp;#39;s more with problems in your lower feet this is called peripheral neuropathy which you have this it could be burning on the bottom of the feet it can be pain it can be numbness it could be any type of weird sensation at the bottom of your feet and the reason why why it gets worse at night is because you&amp;#39;re lying down flat and you&amp;#39;re getting more um pooling of blood which is going to create a little more pressure on the nerve endings which are damaged the remedy for peripheral neuropathy is really twofold one is it&amp;#39;s a type of B vitamin called botam with alphalipoic acid together it&amp;#39;s a really powerful combination now the next symptom is also related to this it&amp;#39;s cramps in your lower legs or your feet because someone has too much sugar in the blood and that creates a magnesium deficiency and when you don&amp;#39;t have enough magnesium calcium starts building up inside the cell and calcium is all about muscle contraction not muscle relaxation magnesium is more about muscle relaxation so when you have this imbalance of not enough magnesium and too much calcium in the wrong place you&amp;#39;re going to get cramping in your lower legs or feet the type of magnesium I would recommend is magnesium glycinate because it also helps you sleep at the same time now the next symptom I want to talk about is this excessive sweating at night usually in the face the neck or upper part of the body and I&amp;#39;m not going to confuse this with a different condition night sweats or hot flashes because of menopause this is different this is a situation where a person is just sweating at night for no reason it&amp;#39;s not even necessarily too hot and this is because the blood sugar problem puts that person in a state of fight or flight mode this is called sympathetic dominance it&amp;#39;s a part of the nervous system that is more of a adrenaline type stress State and because adrenaline is activated the person starts activating more sweat as a compensation mechanism and so when you have this blood sugar issue your body&amp;#39;s going to be under more stress now this can occur also with low blood sugar because adrenaline is activating and tring to raise the blood sugar but it can also occur from high blood sugar as well all right the next condition is sleep apnea this is a situation where you don&amp;#39;t have enough oxygen because there&amp;#39;s some type of obstruction of air in the back of the throat or the sinuses this is a classic diabetic symptom it usually occurs because the person has a lot of insulin that is pumping through their body doctors never measure it but it&amp;#39;s related to something called insulin resistance where the body is trying to protect you from too much toxic from glucose or sugar and because insulin controls this whole thing it creates this resistance to insulin and so the door is uh blocked but of course the problem with this is you&amp;#39;re going to gain a lot of weight because you have this compensating excess amount of insulin which is a fat storing hormone now the next symptom has to do with just hypoglycemia low blood sugar because the body is going to want to get that Sugar out of your bloodstream and it does it with insulin like I said in the previous symptom your insulin&amp;#39;s going to be high and the high insulin is going to try to push the blood sugars down so you&amp;#39;re going to wake up in the middle of night sometimes with low blood sugar and one of the big problems with that is an activation of adrenaline so you just wake up in the middle of night with this like stress a hormone activation and you might also have a elevation of this other hormone called cortisol usually between 2:00 and 3:00 in the middle of the night in fact right in the early morning when the alarm clock is going to go off that&amp;#39;s when you can sleep the best and this release of sugar is also accompanied by the production of Sugar by your liver uh in the early morning you just need to get on a low carb diet for a period of time probably longer than you think to correct it because sometimes it takes six to eight months but many times it&amp;#39;s not coming from the diet it&amp;#39;s coming from your liver just making too much sugar because you ate the wrong foods for many years the next symptom is delayed sleep because high levels of sugar they delay this release of melatonin you&amp;#39;ll be lying down at night and waiting to go to sleep but you just can&amp;#39;t go to sleep easily the next symptom relates to gastric reflux or gird where you have to kind of sleep on this wedge or prop your pillows up because the acid is regurgitating from a valve in your esophagus the reason for that is because the blood sugar issue is affecting the autonomic nervous system which controls the valves of the body including the valve on the top of the stomach so we&amp;#39;re getting this lack of control I think a really good solution for that would be the low carb ketogenic diet as a necessity but also consuming two meals the first meal in the morning the second meal at lunch now the reason that&amp;#39;s going to help you is because you&amp;#39;re getting maybe the same calories but they&amp;#39;re in the first part of the day not the last part of the day because you&amp;#39;re system is so slow if you eat too late things just kind of back up the next symptom is either nightmares or very vivid dreams those are usually related to a neurotransmitter problem because you&amp;#39;re very deficient in B1 one of the big things that deplete you at B1 is consuming too many carbs or even being a diabetic and so when my children would have nightmares they&amp;#39; always want me to give them some B1 which will handle that very quickly now the next thing you might experience is uh a bit of high blood pressure in the middle of the night this is called non dipping typically a person when they go to sleep should have things slow down pulse right blood pressure that&amp;#39;s called nocturnal dipping but with diabetes you have what&amp;#39;s called non- dipping it doesn&amp;#39;t do that the blood pressure is just going to start going up you might not even feel your blood pressure but you&amp;#39;re just going to feel awake the next symptom that occurs while you&amp;#39;re sleeping with a blood sugar issue is part palpitations this is primarily because of the lack of electrolytes pottassium deficiency and magnesium deficiency they would benefit greatly from a good electrolyte powder with a lot of magnesium and potassium the next symptom is teeth grinding the activation of the flight or fight mechanism or the sympathetic nervous system puts a person into a state of stress while they&amp;#39;re sleeping as their jaw muscles are activated and they&amp;#39;re grinding their teeth and the last symptom is uh a headache when you wake up in the morning this usually occurs because you are very dehydrated and the Brain needs enough uh fluid to prevent it from having pain and having pressure realize that it&amp;#39;s not just about drinking more water to hydrate you you need these electrolytes with it now that you know the clues the question is what to do to really correct this once and for all if you have not seen this video on what to eat to handle that check it out I put it right here",

about it even your friend Brenda even though it seems like it was an overnight sensation OIC was really just the latest drug developed for diabetes diabetes is a disease that&amp;#39;s been around for thousands and thousands of years literally since the Neanderthals were walking around painting in caves recently I went to the doctor and something happened um you know when you have to pee in a cup it&amp;#39;s pretty but my doctor came back and he was like hey your pee is full of sugar and I was like I don&amp;#39;t know what that means and he was like this could mean that you have diabetes and I was like what I could have diabet what so I had to do a bunch more tests and I was waiting for the test results you know but I was like Googling like oh no what is this new life going to look like for me just preparing for the worst really turns out like luckily I didn&amp;#39;t have diabetes just my liver wasn&amp;#39;t working properly or whatever it was uh but still you know I couldn&amp;#39;t stop reading about it because it turns out this disease has an insane history before there was insulin in OIC there were starvation diets opium cocktails and beer made of literal pe oh yes baby girl Lisa listen diabetes has such an interesting history so let&amp;#39;s talk about the dark history of diabetes huh [Music] hi friends I hope you&amp;#39;re having a wonderful day today my name is Bailey seran and I&amp;#39;d like to welcome you to my podcast dark history Here We Believe history does not have to be boring it might be tragic sometimes it&amp;#39;s happy but either way it&amp;#39;s our dark history before we get into it don&amp;#39;t forget to like And subscribe because I&amp;#39;m here for you always posting new content hi and make sure to leave a comment down below letting me know what your favorite animal is thank you so much before we get started into today&amp;#39;s story I just want to say that diabetes is I&amp;#39;m not a doctor hi I don&amp;#39;t know if you know this but I&amp;#39;m just a girl on the Internet it&amp;#39;s a complicated disease right the two types I&amp;#39;m going to be focusing on today are the two common types of diabetes type one and type two so that&amp;#39;s what we&amp;#39;re going to be talking about okay okay on all of our episodes we get experts to weighin and stuff so we make sure everything that we&amp;#39;re saying is credible but I&amp;#39;m just saying like you know at the end of the day I&amp;#39;m not a doctor thank you I just had to let you know so picture this you&amp;#39;re in ancient Egypt around the year 1550 BC life was a little different especially in the medical world most of what doctors were working with what the herbs spells guesses but even back then doctors noticed something strange going on with some people they had this insatiable unquenchable thirst and they were peeing a lot on top of all that their pee was sticky and had a certain sweet smell so they noticed this they were taking notes now they didn&amp;#39;t know what was causing it but they definitely saw the symptoms and thought hm something is off do you guys remember Dr Shu shuta we talked about him in our plastic surgery episode kind of another deep cut history throwback there dark history deep cut well he was a Hindu Doctor Who basically vented the ancient version of a nose job back in the 6th Century BC yeah go off well Dr Su shuta was a very busy guy because not only was he inventing and perfecting the rhinoplasty but he also made some important discoveries in the world of diabetes he wrote In His medical textbooks about this mysterious disease which he called madum or honey urine because there was so much sugar in the people&amp;#39;s urine I guess they would pop a squat somewhere you know pee and right afterwards ants would rush over to where the pee was at because it was so sweet so Dr sush shuta argued that the disease was more common in people who were overweight and quote gluttonous and that it also seemed to run in the family but he also did note that the sickness could occur in lean piece in lean people excuse me lean people and in those most cases it was more severe he didn&amp;#39;t know it at the time but he was basically looking at the difference between Type 2 and type 1 diabetes Now fast forward a few centuries and this is when the ancient Greeks take things a step further they start by giving diabetes its name which in Greek means to pass through because people with diabetes were known to be constantly going to the bathroom pink and Greeks had picked up on the same red flag that doctors shuta had that um the urine of someone with diabetes was sweet now I know what you&amp;#39;re thinking Bailey how did they know that the urine was sweet well listen look we&amp;#39;re we&amp;#39;re not judging but they would determine whether someone had diabetes by tasting a patient&amp;#39;s urine we&amp;#39;re not judging they had to know it was science but even once a doctor discovered that someone had diabetes there was not a whole lot that could be done to cure it especially in Europe in the Middle Ages now this was like the wild west of healthcare the official medical approach to pretty much every illness was like oh you&amp;#39;re sick okay well time to bleed you out meaning they would uh they would practice something called bloodletting we&amp;#39;ve talked about it before but essentially doctors would cut patients in specific areas of their body thinking it would release bad blood and then like cure them in the 1600s diabetes became known as the pissing evil oh yeah it sounds like a metal band but it was just like a medieval slang for diabetes it went cute from honey urine to like the pissing evil but it got a little Rebrand sadly once you got the pissing evil uh it was almost like a death sentence you would just waste away I mean people would lose extreme amounts of weight become weak and things went downhill fast in the 1700s there was a patient named Peter Dickinson he was 33 years old when he was sent to a hospital in Liverpool England he had diabetic symptoms and was passing 28 pints of urine per day that&amp;#39;s like peeing over 56 cups a day think of those gallons of milk it&amp;#39;s almost like it&amp;#39;s like four of those per day so this made Peter super weak emanated and thirsty just 8 months into his diagnosis things were not looking good for him his doctor Dr Matthew Dobson had the idea to evaporate Peter&amp;#39;s urine to figure out exactly what was giving it that sweet smell and sure enough once the liquid evaporated all that was left was a white substance and Dr Dobson claimed that this white substance was basically the same as table sugar he like what and once this PE sugar theory was public knowledge people took it and ran with it and they decided to run their own unique experiments with diabetic urine and one of those experiments led to the creation of urine beer so by the late 1700s Dr Dobson had taken his patient urine and came to the conclusion that sugar was present in it meanwhile a Scottish doctor named Dr Francis Hol was also experimenting with diabetic patients and maybe he had heard about the project that Dr Dobson had done because he started to do something also a little unconventional in 1780 Dr Holmes started fermenting the urine of his patience with yeast to make beer yes he would mix half a pint of yeast with 24 pints of one of his patients urine just in case you&amp;#39;re wanting the recipe at home and Dr Holm wrote that quote it soon began to ferment an exit of vapor like fermenting liquor next day it fermented strongly on the third their fermentation seemed over it had lost all sweetness and tasted like small beer so should we just be turning all the urine into beer I mean I&amp;#39;m okay okay small beer just means low alcohol beer that&amp;#39;s what that means now that everyone in their mother knew that there was like literally sugar in the urine of diabetics doctors were determined to figure figure out where is it coming from and most importantly how to stop all these poor people from dying a terrible death so all these experimental treatments start popping up but again they&amp;#39;re pretty extreme for example doctors believe that you could get rid of Diabetes by going on a diet of starvation yes doctors were literally prescribing patients to starve yep sometimes doctors were prescribing less than 300 calories per day this meant that patients would just starve to death before the diabetes could kill them there were other diets besides the starvation ones but they weren&amp;#39;t very appetizing an army surgeon named Dr John Rolo I think it is published a book with a diet for diabetics that consisted of mostly animal meat and fat you could have something called suet which is a hard white animal fat that comes from the kidneys of cows and sheep you can also have lard butter and blood pudding Dr Rolo also suggested eating as much rancid or rotten meat as like your stomach could handle for best results the book suggested patients also have a little nighttime cocktail made of opium aloe vera soap and laxative wine that&amp;#39;s quite the mixture right right I know now all this was supposed to help treat the diabetes but none of them they were all again just trying new things like hey if you starve will that fix the diabetes if you eat raw meat will that fix the the diabetes like it&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s where we&amp;#39;re at right now none of these diets make sense to us but again the idea was to prevent the formation of sugar in the body um especially with that last one by like pooping it out first with the laxative now this was actually seen as a pretty big step in the treatment of diabetes and even though the diet was dangerous and and extreme in some cases patients actually did recover from some diabetes symptoms but mostly in patients with type 2 diabetes Now if you had type one this diet didn&amp;#39;t do very much from this point on doctors believe the most important method of treating diabetes was through diet at this point there was lots of theories on what was causing diabetes my personal favorite theory was that diabetes was caused by excess of vener meaning too much sex that they believe that&amp;#39;s what caused diabetes was too much sex and the doctor&amp;#39;s Minds anything sinful or pleasurable was connected to diabetes like for example smoking or drinking too much um and again sex you know diabetes but that theory didn&amp;#39;t really hold up because they were diabetic patients who claimed to be virgins and this confused doctors and they&amp;#39;re like but too much sex gives you diabetes you&amp;#39;re a liar you know but it really debunked this wild Theory but after Decades of doctors recommending sketchy diets and abstinence there was finally a scientific breakthrough in 1889 two German scientists Oscar manowski and Joseph Von Maring had been experimenting in the field of diabetes and they had a hunch that something called the pancreas might be connected to the root cause so they decided to perform a procedure to remove the pancreas from a dog now after the surgery even though the dog was house trained the dog started peeing everywhere and I guess Dr manowski yelled at the man who worked in their lab because it was supposed to be his job to take the dog out and make sure it went potty you know but the lab worker told Dr manowski didn&amp;#39;t matter how much he took this dog on walks he was still peeing everywhere manowski tested the dog&amp;#39;s urine and sure enough it was full of Sugar by removing the pancreas Dr manowski and Dr Maring had given this dog type 1 diabetes I know sadly though the dog dog died shortly after his pancreas was removed um just wanted to shout out to that that dog he really though solved the mystery to a diabetes so yeah in the eyes of an angel look though this unlocked the key to solving diabetes I mean the pancreas was the key so that&amp;#39;s in my intro I think I said liver and I think pancreas is what he said either way pancreas was the key finally a clue that wasn&amp;#39;t based on drinking or making people eat rotten meat or opium you know before Dr manowski and Dr Maring made this discovery most people literally had no clue what a pancreas was or what it did many scientists believed it was sort of like a leftover organ that used to have a purpose you know but then over the course of evolution became kind of useless I would say like a pinky toe but your pinky toe is actually really important for balance so it&amp;#39;s not like a pinky to but the connection between diabetes and the pancreas was undeniable unfortunately for the dog Community the experiment was repeated and had the same results without a pancreas you would develop diabetes and then sadly die even though it seemed like science was getting closer to figuring out the cause they still weren&amp;#39;t any closer to a cure it was this huge mystery that no one could solve then after Decades of experiments and tests a miracle drug was invented in 1921 a Canadian scientist named Dr Frederick Banting and his assistant Charles best I know what a great last name best if your last name is best I&amp;#39;d be the best at everything anyways they were experimenting with dogs sorry about that poor dogs RP those dogs you know they really did it for us they knew by this point that the pancreas controlled blood sugar but how well after studying on all these poor dog test subjects scientists discovered something in the body called insulin insulin is what allows your body to take glucose from your food and use it for energy and without insulin sugar just builds up in your blood and that&amp;#39;s what makes diabetes so dangerous it became clear that for people with diabetes their pancreas was making enough or any insulin within 6 months Dr Banting and Best figured out how to isolate insulin which was huge this meant they would be able to inject it into someone who didn&amp;#39;t have a functioning pancreas and after some trials they were finally ready to test it on a patient a person not a dog Leonard Thompson was a 14-year-old boy who was dying of diabetes his body just wasn&amp;#39;t making insulin and he had all the classic signs constant urination weakness and poor Leonard was just a death door Leonard&amp;#39;s doctors had him on a starvation diet to try and manage his diabetes so for 3 years he was barely eating anything and his diabetes was still unfortunately looking terminal by 1922 Leonard weighed only 65 lb on January 11th 1922 Leonard became the first ever human being to get an insulin injection from Banting and Best but it didn&amp;#39;t do much for him now Banting and Best they were scratching their heads probably trying to figure out you know what went wrong you know when a biochemist on their team named James colip decided to see if he could fine-tune the insulin formula now James refined the insulin and came up with a new formula and this was the second injection that they gave little Leonard this time the doctors were very hopeful you know they were holding their breath watching Leonard like a hawk just crossing their fingers and guess what it worked Leonard&amp;#39;s blood sugar levels dropped and he lived he had to be on insulin for the rest of his life but still I mean he lived until the age of 26 when he died of pneumonia yes poor Leonard rest in peace Leonard sorry about that Leonard but he got to live to 26 you know Leonard went down in history as the first diabetic to be treated with insulin and live far beyond what any doctor would have predicted now this was an absolute Miracle insulin went on to save countless lives and Dr Banting became a total rock star in the medical world they even gave him a Nobel Prize in 1923 as he deserves I mean this was Major because insulin was seen as like again this incredible new wonder drug scientists were curious what it could do for non-diabetics from the 1920s all the way through the 60s doctors started using it on schizophrenic patients to put them in literal Comas yeah this was new to me apparently this would give them a temporary feeling of relief for some but there are also plenty of cases of institutionalized patients begging for these doctors to stop torturing them with insulin this procedure was basically done every day and patients were held in comas for hours at a time sometimes it could last for months in some cases patients wouldn&amp;#39;t be able to wake up from this coma so that was a pretty big risk and if they did there sometimes would be irreversible brain damage okay look you know if you watch murder mystery or if you&amp;#39;re into true crime or something you know sometimes people use insulin to like kill people that too I&amp;#39;m just saying that sometimes they do that you got to watch out for these psychos out here even for diabetics the insulin treatments were a little sketchy at first early insulin was extracted from cows and pigs and it had to be injected with this huge like painful needles over time though it did get better we figured out how to produce human insulin in a lab and it became a lot more accessible and safe ever since then doctors and Specialists have continued to to study insulin and figured out how to manufacture it so that people with diabetes can live normal healthy lives but whenever a miracle drug enters the chat it&amp;#39;s only a matter of time before the pharmaceutical industry figures out a way to profit off of it you know at least here in America right and at any cost so insulin is Saving Lives doctors are obsessed and they found a way to make it in a lab instead of extracting it from animals this was major as soon as it was clear this medicine was a miracle drug the pharmaceutical industry jumped in and tried to make money off of it but here&amp;#39;s the crazy thing insulin is actually factually pretty cheap to produce so the high cost is entirely based on Pharma companies upcharging because they know people literally can&amp;#39;t live without it they&amp;#39;re thinking diabetics will pay any price because they need it one article from 2019 estimated that labade insulin should at most be costing a user $133 per year but insulin manufacturers have jacked up the price in order to make more profit between 2017 and 2022 alone insulin prices increased by 24% the rising cost has led to really dangerous situations like people people rationing their insulin in 2017 there was a 22-year-old diabetic woman who had her insulin covered by her insurance you know how insurance goes something changes one day and they don&amp;#39;t really tell you and then one day her insulin went from being free to now $500 out of pocket what do you do you know she couldn&amp;#39;t afford it and because this happened so abruptly she didn&amp;#39;t know like what to do well without her insulin she she died you know I&amp;#39;m sure if you&amp;#39;re aware if you&amp;#39;re a diabetic or know someone who&amp;#39;s a diabetic like this is not the only case Okay because of the insane greed on the part of Pharma companies thousands of people are having a hard time getting the medication they need to survive because these selfish companies just want to make a lot of money it&amp;#39;s sick it&amp;#39;s so sick it should be illegal I don&amp;#39;t even know I it&amp;#39;s deeply upsetting and you know when we were reading about this we also learned that this is something that EpiPen users are dealing with as well you and I can agree you shouldn&amp;#39;t have to ration something that you cannot live without like that just shouldn&amp;#39;t be allowed you know that&amp;#39;s like having a ration water but also this is 2025 or whatever like we&amp;#39;re in the future don&amp;#39;t you think like we have the medicine why can&amp;#39;t you just give it to the people I get it you got to charge whatever 10 bucks okay like what are we like why are we in such a selfish like why is Big Pharma just the a demon I don&amp;#39;t get it any who back to diabetes Bailey Focus um there&amp;#39;s this company called type 1 International and a hashtag going around that&amp;#39;s hash insulin forall it&amp;#39;s like a campaign um on social media and they are putting pressure on big farmer companies like Eli Lily and Nova nordis show their logos so we know anyways people are really fighting hard to lower the prices some states like Ohio and North Dakota are even working to create a Statewide cap on insulin prices so that no one in need of insulin would have to pay more than $35 some companies have started to comply with these price caps but we don&amp;#39;t know it could also just be a publicity move and then they go right back to what they were doing we are you know hope for the best but this it&amp;#39;s hard too when there&amp;#39;s these big uh corporations involved huh Nova Nordisk one of the major producers of insulin now they initially said that they would decrease their prices you know we&amp;#39;re for the people but later announced a plan to stop selling insulin altogether just before the price cut was set to take place kind of weird huh hm people are worried that other company will follow Novo nordis lead that&amp;#39;s a hard name Novo nordis anyways and just stop making it all together rather than making it affordable which is weird right like you&amp;#39;re still going to make money off of it right like I don&amp;#39;t whatever these people are [ __ ] lunatics and if that happens though if people just stop producing it and selling it insulin would basically it could potentially be like really hard to find and and because it will be hard to find it could probably be more expensive but that&amp;#39;s just like worst case scenario we don&amp;#39;t know what&amp;#39;s insane is that diabetes though has been around essentially since the beginning of recorded history yet it seems like treatment options are still not what they could or maybe should be in 2022 California approved a budget that put 1007 million towards domestic insulin production research and development this would be a major development if it actually happens it would dramatically reduce costs at least in California which leads us to today and to a drug that you&amp;#39;ve definitely heard of OIC which also goes by the name um semaglutide now OIC was originally approved as a treatment for type 2 diabetes but as you&amp;#39;ve probably seen in the news on social media it&amp;#39;s gained most of its popularity as a weight loss drug if first started with celebrities right then influencers and everyday people using OIC and not to treat diabetes but to lose weight to most people OIC seems like a brand new thing back in 2022 OIC blew up on Tik Tok when people were posting under the hashtag my OIC journey and nothing will create a worldwide demand like a good old Tik Tok Trend literally within weeks of that hashtag take off the therapeutic Goods administration had to announce a shortage of OIC because of quote an unexpected increase in consumer demand Hollywood doctors started noticing a huge uptick in interest and soon enough it seemed like everyone who was anyone was either taking OIC or wanting to and the list goes on I mean everybody was taking OIC I know tons of people who&amp;#39;ve been taking OIC I mean it&amp;#39;s kind of like the the weight loss answer that people have been wanting if I could just take a pill and lose weight like I&amp;#39;d be so happy you know and in a way OIC was kind of that it&amp;#39;s a shot um and you could lose weight from it so I mean yeah I get it I I understand why people are doing it and you lose the weight fast and that&amp;#39;s where it gets a little tricky for me personally because like if someone can like lose weight and like they feel good about themselves and they&amp;#39;re living better happier quality of like a better quality of life it&amp;#39;s like hell yeah if you don&amp;#39;t have any crazy side effects or anything like do it um as long as you&amp;#39;re not hurting anybody else right I think the biggest concern with OIC was that it was it taking away from people who actually needed it like that was the big conversation but the story of OIC began long before it came to Hollywood it actually all start it started way back in the 1930s with monster lizards I this story is weird huh yes you heard me right OIC started because of monster lizards mhm you see in the 1930s scientists were very interested in learning more about insulin not just about how it worked but how it was produced in the body in 1932 a Belgian researcher named John laar discovered that insulin was produced through a hormone he called incretin nowadays in creton is called Gip which stands for a really long name that I&amp;#39;m not going to say and doesn&amp;#39;t matter I don&amp;#39;t know they&amp;#39;re just like studying [ __ ] okay in the80s researchers they identified a hormone that worked with GP okay to produce insulin it was gp1 I know chemistry here we go you know anywh who they find this out and they&amp;#39;re like wow this is a really cool Discovery but glp1 was hard to isolate and quick to metabolize which meant it couldn&amp;#39;t be bottled or sold so of course big farma didn&amp;#39;t give like a damn about it for a while until the monster lizards I know the best part so in the 1980s researchers began looking into the Venom of a lizard called the hila monster hila monsters are a rare breed from the southwestern United States whose poisonous venom is about as potent as a rattlesnake I know I was like new fear unlocked great so you know you would think a bite from the hila monster is fatal right well I I guess wrong in fact the interaction between hila monster Venom and human hormones turns out to have a huge breakthrough in treating diabetes man science is wild huh I know people find out we wild [ __ ] so this guy Dr John en he&amp;#39;s an endocrinologist at the Veterans Administration Center in the Bronx and he discovered something in the hila Venom which he named exen 4 exan 4 was really similar to gp1 the human hormone that big Pharma was ignoring because it wasn&amp;#39;t marketable and Dr E discovered that exan 4 could stimulate the pancreas to create insulin and unlike glp one it was more shelf stable so it could be bottled and sold in the 9s Dr E made an even crazier Discovery heila monsters were able to slow down their own metabolisms now that meant that they could go without food for long periods of time without their blood sugar dropping so he thought there might be a connection here and one that could be super useful to the humans obviously it was a little bit of a challenge for Dr E to get funding for a drug based on poisonous lizard Venom but eventually a synthetic version of this magical Lizard Juice was manufactured in 2005 the hormone received FDA approval for diabetes treatment under the name beta once beta was in the market or was out in the market people started to notice something Not only was it effective for for managing diabetes but it was causing weight loss of 5% and sometimes more in its patients and if there&amp;#39;s one thing our culture loves it&amp;#39;s weight loss huh especially when it&amp;#39;s fast and easy within 6 months beta was not about diabetes it was being used as an off label Miracle weight loss drug the only problem was that bieta could only be given by injection twice a day every every single day and sure it&amp;#39;s great to slim down you know a little but you know for some was it worth having to stab yourself twice a day I think many people would say yes it was worth it and at this point Nova Nordisk steps in they developed the drug semi glutide which was approved under the brand name OIC in 2017 semi glutide was especially cool because unlike beta it only required one one injection a week so you got all the weight loss benefits and less stabbing a higher dose version of semi glutide was later approved under the name we GOI in 2021 people tossed beteta to the curb once OIC was introduced OIC was this shiny new toy you know it requires less injections and had some heart health benefits that beta didn&amp;#39;t ever since 2017 OIC has skyrocketed in popularity leading to a lot of shortages so in 2022 and 20124 there were such severe shortages of OIC that people who needed it to manage their diabetes were kind of out of luck it was estimated that one in eight adults in the US have taken OIC or another glp1 drug and 6% of Americans are currently on it one of the biggest problems with diabetes besides the cost of treating it is that it&amp;#39;s on the rise according to doctors the rates of type 2 diabetes have skyrocketed in recent decades mostly because of modern diets and our lifestyles I mean think about it our processed foods our sugary drinks we don&amp;#39;t move as much you know not not me trying to sh I sit all goddamn day Dr Tara Seymour from John&amp;#39;s Hopkins says quot for managing type 2 diabetes a healthy diet rich in fruits vegetables and whole grains combined with regular physical activity is often the most powerful tool you have you know doctors always say that and it&amp;#39;s like yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah I get it but I don&amp;#39;t know why is it so hard to do because fruits and all that stuff are expensive the grains I can it&amp;#39;s like just tell me what to eat just tell me what to eat I don&amp;#39;t know what that means what is a grain I I don&amp;#39;t even know Wonderbread is that a grain I don&amp;#39;t know it&amp;#39;s not I found out many people argue that diabetes has become an epidemic the World Health Organization notes that the number of people with diabetes Rose from 108 million in 1980 to 422 million in 2014 these numbers are especially high in low and middle inome countries now before you get on your little your little Soap Box stand where what&amp;#39;s that called your little soapbox I don&amp;#39;t understand that saying but I whatever and people are like oh just stop eating processed foods and on sugar and all that stuff okay first of all sit your ass down a lot of people throughout the world and in our country and in uh communities where there are things called food deserts can only afford processed foods that are high in sugar and lots of us have jobs that don&amp;#39;t leave us with time to like work out take spin class freaking cook a meal with whole grains and then on top of that sure it&amp;#39;s like just because treatments are available doesn&amp;#39;t mean that they&amp;#39;re accessible to everyone diabetes and kidney disease due to diabetes caused an estimated 2 million deaths but there&amp;#39;s some Hope just recently there was a stem cell treatment that was done on a 25-year-old woman with type 1 diabetes and this treatment allowed the woman to start producing her own insulin in less than 3 months yeah stem cell research now this patient has has been cured for over a year now and has seen her diabetes completely reversed what huh what yeah but this is just the first study and it was the first patient plus her doctors say that they really want to see her continue to produce insulin up to 5 years before they consider her to be cured you know so it&amp;#39;s like an ongoing study but I mean if this comes through this is Major this will be a huge step forward and who knows I mean hopefully maybe diabetes will be a thing of the past diabetes runs in my family so it&amp;#39;s like oh [ __ ] oh [ __ ] you know and I love sugar too H anyhoo so what&amp;#39;s did we learn here today that diabetes has been around for a very long time which I was like what that&amp;#39;s crazy and um people need insulin and Insulin should be affordable I think we can all agree on that and O and all that stuff I don&amp;#39;t know as long as like people who need it are getting it but if like you want to take OIC I&amp;#39;m not judging live your life you know if you want to feel good do your thing well transition into next week&amp;#39;s episode let me tell you we did a dark history episode a while back on America&amp;#39;s founding fathers we found out some bizarre facts about their lives behind closed doors and a lot of them had one thing in common they were obsessed with their penis so join us next week as we talk about the dark history of weird presidents well friends thank you for hanging out with me today did you know you can join me over on my YouTube where you can watch these episodes on Thursday after the podcast airs and while you&amp;#39;re there you can also catch my murder mystery and makeup and don&amp;#39;t forget to subscribe because I&amp;#39;m here for you all the time with new content I&amp;#39;d love to hear your guys&amp;#39; reactions to today&amp;#39;s story so make sure to leave a comment down below and it might even be featured in a future episode now let&amp;#39;s read a couple of comments you guys have left me my favorite part Z Sherry 11 left a comment on our ancient torture part two episode saying the real ancient torture technique is me clicking on this video right after I put together a delicious salad I mean I could see where that&amp;#39;s not a good idea I think I&amp;#39;m just a sick person cuz I&amp;#39;ll be eating and like what tell me more you know like I don&amp;#39;t care I don&amp;#39;t care I guess I should have G gave a disclaim didn&amp;#39;t I give a disclaimer I think I gave a disclaimer so I think that one&amp;#39;s on you girl thank you for listening I hope you learned a lot mhm Abby cook 7447 left a comment on our board games episode saying quote fun fact Lizzy is from mome Illinois they recently just turned the town square into a giant Monopoly board that&amp;#39;s playable I believe it&amp;#39;s super cool Abby thank you so much for sharing this I&amp;#39;m glad Lizzie is getting the recognition she deserves and I would love to see this in person do you live close by can you go and take pictures and send it to me I&amp;#39;m always asking for pictures from you guys and I get nothing I want pictures God damn it so go and take a picture let me see and then um I want to go I want to visit with the address let me know let me know thank you for watching and letting me know Betty Sullivan 3282 left us an episode saying maybe you could do a dark history on chlorop form it&amp;#39;s been in so many videos Betty first of all love your cake mix um chloroform you know I feel like this is a safe space I&amp;#39;m not judging because obviously I&amp;#39;m my mind goes to murder mystery makeup and all the times you hear about chloroform being used but you know what you might be honest something there like why was it made in the first place and who figured out that you could like knock people out with it there might be an interesting history behind it and I think I&amp;#39;m going to make a note of this floral for you know it&amp;#39;s one of those words that has like it&amp;#39;s hard to spell um I&amp;#39;ll look into this though because you might be on to something there like what is Chlor form technically even for besides knocking out people thank you I love to hear it I love a recommendation I appreciate you guys so much for watching and engaging and you know keep commenting because maybe your comment will be featured and hey if you don&amp;#39;t know dark history is an AUD boom original I want to give a big special thank you to our expert Stuart Bradwell author of insulin 100-year history and I&amp;#39;m your host Bailey seran I hope you have a good day you make good choices and I&amp;#39;ll be talking to you very soon goodbye you [Music]",

    "transcript": "As of 2019, over 37 million\nAmericans, or 11.3% of the population had diabetes. I&amp;#39;ve had type one diabetes\nfor 25 years, and the best thing a diabetic can do to\nstay healthy is to keep their blood sugars in\nnormal range. Technology like continuous\nglucose monitors or cgms allow diabetics to see\ntheir blood sugar 24/7 Cgms are incredibly useful\ntools, allowing diabetics to get insight on how blood\nsugar reacts to insulin, food and many other things\nthat affect it. Abbott Laboratories focuses\non diagnostics, pharmaceuticals and medical\ndevices. There are a few companies\nwho make Cgms, but Abbott and Dexcom are the leaders\nin the space. In 2021, Freestyle Libre\nsales totaled $3.7 billion, with 4 million users\nglobally, while Dexcom, who only makes CGM Systems,\nreported $2.4 billion in revenue in 2021 and 1.25\nmillion users globally. Abbott&amp;#39;s previously based\nsystems were flash cgms, meaning you had to hold\nyour reader or phone up to the sensor to get a\nreading, a tool more suitable for diabetics who\nmay not need to check blood sugar readings quite as\noften. Abbott&amp;#39;s newest CGM, the\nFreestyle Libre three, has just been released. It&amp;#39;s now sending data\nstraight to your phone. Abbott sent CNBC three\nsensors to review. Let&amp;#39;s check it out. The cartridge comes in a\nsmall box and is rather compact. The Libre three is\nFDA approved to only be used in the arm. Okay, Ready? Three, two, one. And there she is. It&amp;#39;s so small. Open the app and scan the\nsensor. Then it takes 60 minutes to\nwarm up during the first 12 hours. A blood drop icon\nwill appear. Abbott says the sensor is\nacclimating in that time and to use a glucometer to\nensure that the sensor is accurate. I found that it\nwas accurate as soon as I put it on. It still doesn&amp;#39;t\nrequire finger sticks or calibration. The system\nstays on for 14 days. It gives a new reading\nevery minute versus every 5 minutes. Like the Dexcom\nG6, The adhesive worked well and showed no sign of\nfalling off after 14 days. The trend arrows tell you\nif your glucose is steady, rising or falling, the\nalarms are customizable. You have the option to\nsilence low and high alerts. The urgent low alarm cannot\nbe silenced, which is an FDA requirement. The app does\nhave some good features with graphs for your average\nglucose, time and range and a share option for loved\nones. It also has a reports\nfeature that gives you insights into patterns\nallowing you to make dosage adjustments. I put my\nDexcom G6 nearby to compare the sizes and there is a\nbig difference. After using the library for\nover a month, I had a few key takeaways and the\nbiggest one is just how small it is. I kept\nforgetting that I even had it on. The library was\naccurate most of the time. I found that during times\nof rapid change, like if I forgot to take insulin for\na meal, it became inaccurate and had a hard time keeping\nup. There were a few things\nthat I think could be improved in the app. You can&amp;#39;t customize the\ngraph size. I&amp;#39;d like the ability to\nchoose that, so it&amp;#39;s a little bit tighter. You\nalso can&amp;#39;t zoom in to past readings. Sometimes when\nI&amp;#39;m having a low blood sugar, I like to be able to\nzoom in and see how quickly the number is changing. And while it does send\nnotifications to my iWatch, they have yet to make an\napp compatible to use with it. So seeing your blood\nsugar value on your watch is not possible yet. Abbott says that&amp;#39;s\nsomething they are working on for the future. The Libre three is\nprescription only, so the cost will be different for\neveryone. Abbott said users with\ninsurance can expect to pay 0 to $25 per sensor and $70\nper sensor without insurance. So would I\nrecommend this to other diabetics? Yes, but it\ndepends on the user. For diabetics like me who\nuse an insulin pump, the LIBRE three still isn&amp;#39;t\ncompatible with them yet, although Abbott says they\nshould be in the near future for diabetics who use\nmultiple daily injections or diet to manage their\ndiabetes. I think the Libre three is a great tool to\nhelp manage blood sugar.",

controlled then it starts biting you literally it can affect your eyes kidneys heart feet in fact we say from the head to the toe can be affected by diabetes [Music] type 1 diabetes this occurs in children it&amp;#39;s an acute onset children have very high blood sugars and the only treatment for such children who have this type of type 1 diabetes [Music] type 2 diabetes in india it&amp;#39;s estimated that more than 75 million people have type 2 diabetes now why do we get type 2 diabetes [Music] i find the simplest way to teach people about diet is to learn about the plate concept that you are seeing here in the healthy plate concept what do you do you have the same thali no doubt but now you see 50 percent of that thali is filled with healthy green leafy vegetables now you got the other half in that half divide it into two quarters and one quarter as you can see here is reserved for when you have such a high carbohydrate load it&amp;#39;s very difficult to prevent diabetes and it&amp;#39;s also very difficult to control diabetes so people all the time talk about oh i&amp;#39;ll reduce my carbohydrate my diabetes will go away for how long will reduce your carbohydrate [Music] hello everyone i am dr v mohan and i&amp;#39;ll be speaking in a series of videos all that you need to know about diabetes the first question that people ask me is is diabetes a disease or is it a disorder what do you think is the answer well i&amp;#39;ll tell you the answer it can either be a disorder or it can be a disease and is left to you to decide how you want to make diabetes if you just have a little bit of high sugar in your blood and this is reversible or it can be controlled its not going to do any harm to you at all then why call it a disease its just a simple disorder and your whole life you can just keep diabetes as just like your friend and it&amp;#39;s just a simple disorder and it&amp;#39;s not going to affect you in any way but diabetes is like a tiger now what&amp;#39;s a comparison between diabetes and a tiger you may ask as long as the tiger is in the cage like this it is safe you can go and stand near it you can say hi to it and it doesn&amp;#39;t affect you but what will happen if you release the cage and the tiger comes charging at you like this it&amp;#39;s a completely different tiger isn&amp;#39;t it diabetes is like that as long as you keep it under control you really don&amp;#39;t have to worry about it and you don&amp;#39;t even have to call it as a disease it&amp;#39;s a simple disorder but if you don&amp;#39;t look after diabetes if diabetes is not controlled then it starts biting you literally it can affect your eyes kidneys heart feet in fact we say from the head to the toe including the head and the toe can be affected by diabetes so ladies and gentlemen the choice is yours do you want to treat diabetes like a simple disorder which may even be completely reversible you can even remove it from your system or are you going to allow this to grow like a cancer inside your body until ultimately all the organs get affected whenever we use the word diabetes people think it is one disease it&amp;#39;s not so diabetes is of different types and each type of diabetes is diagnosed differently the symptoms are different and the treatment is also different so we cannot mix up two types of diabetes because the approach to it is completely different for example let me give you just two examples one is a type of diabetes called as type one diabetes this occurs in children is an acute onset children have very high blood sugars and the only treatment for such children who have this type of type 1 diabetes is insulin in fact you will be surprised to know that insulin itself is discovered only 100 years ago and before that if any child in the world had type 1 diabetes they simply died within 2 months 3 months maximum 1 year insulin changed all that and gave a new life to children with type 1 diabetes today children type 1 diabetes can live even up to 80 90 years my oldest patient is almost 90 years old and had got it when that person was a child but if we don&amp;#39;t qualify which type of diabetes we are talking about we are invariably talking about the second type of diabetes which is called as type 2 diabetes in fact type 2 diabetes almost 90 95 of all the types of diabetes that we see in the world so if you don&amp;#39;t qualify when you talk about diabetes we are talking about type 2 diabetes in india it&amp;#39;s estimated that more than 75 million people have type 2 diabetes now why do we get type 2 diabetes of course the genetic factor is very important if your father mother or both had diabetes your risk of getting type 2 diabetes is very high but that is only about 40 percent of the causes 60 percent of the reason why you get type 2 diabetes is lifestyle related factors and in lifestyle one of the most important is diet what you eat you can see here a very healthy diet shown as well as a very unhealthy diet the unhealthy diet that you see here is what is going to produce diabetes for you look at this one physical active person and a totally physically inactive person we know that physical inactivity or sedentary behavior is another very important cause of type 2 diabetes in this video i&amp;#39;m going to spend time on diet what you can eat what you should try to limit and what perhaps you can avoid completely there is nothing which is totally forbidden but better to avoid certain dietary items and very often people ask me what are the indian diets which are good and what are the indian diets which are not so good now one of the problems with any indian diet whether north india south india east india west india central india or the north east of india that really doesn&amp;#39;t matter the main problem in the indian diet vis-a-vis diabetes type 2 diabetes is the carbohydrate content we all eat too much of carbohydrate whether it is dosa and idli in the south or chapati or puri in the north it really doesn&amp;#39;t matter it&amp;#39;s how much you eat which is very important they are all carbohydrate so the first principle that you must know in an indian diet is portion sizes and what you should take and for that i find so many books are there so many articles have been written but i find the simplest way to teach people about diet is to learn about the plate concept that you&amp;#39;re seeing here what you can see here is a thali or a plate and the way we normally eat is shown here where you fill the plate with a lot of rice like a mountain of rice as we call it and then we have in south india for example we&amp;#39;ll have rice and sambar then rice and rasam then rice and curd and then some other rice item for as dessert also so we are eating rice rice rice all the time so it turns out that 70 to 75 percent of our entire diet comes from carbohydrate when you have such a high carbohydrate load it&amp;#39;s very difficult to prevent diabetes and it&amp;#39;s also very difficult to control diabetes so the first thing that you should do is to follow the healthy plate concept which i have shown here in the healthy plate concept what do you do you have the same thali no doubt but now you see 50 percent of that thali is filled with healthy green leafy vegetables so vegetables form half of your plate now you got the other half in that half divide it into two quarters and one quarter as you can see here is reserved for protein and that is what indians don&amp;#39;t take particularly in south india the protein intake and therefore the fiber intake is very low now where do you get the protein from i would prefer the protein to come from vegetable sources like bengal gram green gram black gram rajma soya mushroom all these constitute very good vegetable protein they&amp;#39;re very healthy they don&amp;#39;t have any fat they give you a lot of nutrients and they give you a lot of fiber so vegetable protein is superior to animal protein and a lot of data to support this however for a staunch non-vegetarian if they come and tell me doc you&amp;#39;re telling me not to eat sugar now you&amp;#39;re telling me to give up non-vegetal this is too much i can&amp;#39;t it&amp;#39;s not worth being a diabetic are not worth living you know that&amp;#39;s what they say is such strict non-vegetarians so it&amp;#39;s not that non-veg should not be taken i said vegetable protein is better than non-vegetarian protein i am sticking to that but if you want to take non-veg protein you can take fish or chicken try to avoid red meat white of the egg is very good you may say why not the yellow yellow is also good it gives you protein but yellow contains cholesterol one egg contains 300 milligram of cholesterol that is your total limit for the whole day so if you have taken that one egg you cannot take cholesterol in any other form whereas you take the egg white the zero cholesterol it gives you a lot of protein so you can have your fat in other forms okay so if you are taking one egg then that is fine you have the egg white and the yellow but the advantage of taking egg white is that you can have four egg whites or five egg whites because there&amp;#39;s zero cholesterol and you&amp;#39;re increasing your protein intake so that second quarter of the plate is reserved for protein now you have got the last quarter that is where your carbohydrate should come in now there is no need just because you live in the south and your rice eating to change to chapati that used to be the old teaching in my father&amp;#39;s days where you know you have rice change it to chapati then you won&amp;#39;t eat much in the north oh you like chapati so you stop that and take rice you know what happens actually when you tell them to eat chapati they&amp;#39;ll eat eight chapatis thinking chappati only no i&amp;#39;m not taking rice because all the violin is mind is thinking i&amp;#39;m not taking rice i&amp;#39;m not taking rice i&amp;#39;m not taking rice so they overheat the chapati and finally the sugar goes up if they&amp;#39;re taking the rice they&amp;#39;ll be more careful and so the opposite in the north as well so continue what you like continue what you are used to but reserve only quarter of the plate for that rice or that chapati or any other carbohydrate that you take if you do this this becomes a healthy plate of course you can add one or two more things you have a bowl of curd for example there is probiotics in it if you have a glass of milk then it gives you a lot of calcium and protein so these are things which you can add on but this plate principle the healthy principle every person with diabetes should know now people also more recently have started asking me instead of rice can i white rice can i take brown rice we have done a lot of research on this at least eight ten peppers are published on this brown rice is very good there&amp;#39;s no doubt that brown rice is healthier it has more b complex it has more fiber the sugar doesn&amp;#39;t go up that much the glycemic index or the propensity to increase the sugar is much less if you take brown rice all that is true but people hate it when they see the brown i can&amp;#39;t take this it smells it doesn&amp;#39;t cook properly i have problem digesting it it doesn&amp;#39;t stay in the shop for long it gets rancid it&amp;#39;s costly it&amp;#39;s not available why should i be taking this well if you have access to brown rice and you like it take it otherwise cut down the white rice and you can still enjoy the rice that you want to take there is no need to change over what about millets of course millets are very good in fact in the ancient days people used to eat millets and they&amp;#39;re very very healthy no doubt about millets are making a comeback the government is also promoting millets in a big way but here is a twist in the tail we did an analysis of all the millets available in the market we went and picked up all the millets and did glycemic index testing on them and we found that the mills also increased the sugar why because the millets are also polished now how did you get white rice the brown rice is polished polish polished and made into white rice you&amp;#39;re removing all the nutrients same thing unfortunately is happening with the millets so if you are able to get unpolished or raw millets as we used to get in our grandfather&amp;#39;s time then take it but if you just buy millets because they are millets and they are polished they are just like rice there is no advantage and they are remember they are also carbohydrate so if you like to change to millets you do that for the sake of diabetes don&amp;#39;t change anything continue the same thing that you are taking what about fruits again you can classify fruits into different types there are fruits which have a high glycemic index the moment you eat the fruit sugar shoots up there are fruits which you take there is only a gentle increase in the sugar low glycemic index or medium glycemic index use those fruits for example apple guava papaya orange watermelon these are fruits with not such a high glycemic index and therefore you can take them but if you take banana or if you take mangoes unfortunately mangoes so popular especially in the season and i&amp;#39;ve got a full video explaining when to eat mango how to eat mango and why a person diabetes can take mango but you can&amp;#39;t just take as much mango as you want your sugar is definitely going to go up and therefore fruits are good for people without diabetes you can take three four five fruits a day people with diabetes take one fruit a day your sugar is very well controlled probably make it two but here&amp;#39;s it catch again don&amp;#39;t take it as fruit juice the moment you take this fruit juice your sugar will go up because amount of fruit going in will go up and there is no fiber when you just drink it you don&amp;#39;t get the fiber you&amp;#39;ll have to eat the fruit as cut fruit so that you can take let&amp;#39;s discuss about oils now again different people have different tastes in kerala they will say oh we are used to coconut oil in chennai we use gingerly oil or ground nut oil in the east and some parts of the north mustard oil is used if you go and tell them no no for diabetes now you change your oil they&amp;#39;ll hate it they won&amp;#39;t enjoy their food so again whichever oil you&amp;#39;re using continue that oil but use only limited quantities don&amp;#39;t take huge quantities whatever is needed for cooking that oil continuous oil that you are taking finally i want to talk about some functional foods of foods which are considered superfoods now the lot of hype about this lot of attention in the media newspapers about different things and is it true or not that things like garlic turmeric and things like that ginger things like that if you take that they are good for health well these are food additives and some of them have a positive effect on immunity they&amp;#39;re certainly not bad for diabetes and may be even good for diabetes but that&amp;#39;s all they are don&amp;#39;t hype them to say that they&amp;#39;re a cure for diabetes i&amp;#39;ve seen things saying that you take turmeric and your diabetes will go away you know nothing is so easy in life i wish it was then i&amp;#39;ll just be making turmeric and giving to all my patients and saying that&amp;#39;s enough don&amp;#39;t come to me just take turmeric it&amp;#39;s not so easy so diabetes reversal diabetes control needs lifelong effort it needs a lot of attention from you it needs a lot of discipline but it&amp;#39;s doable so people all the time talk about oh i&amp;#39;ll reduce my carbohydrate my diabetes will go away for how long will reduce your carbohydrate they even go to zero carbohydrate keto diet all kinds of fancy things they try to reduce weight because the media and so many organizations are telling them oh your diabetes will go your diet is going fact there are people who say don&amp;#39;t go to a diabetologist they&amp;#39;ll just keep on giving you medicine come to us we are the saviors we will get rid of your diabetes you know and you won&amp;#39;t have work for all the diabetes to close the clinic i wish that was true i will become a nephrologist or i will become a cardiologist that&amp;#39;s what i am dreaming of that diabetes goes away in fact i used to joke and say i have a diabetes hospital i used to say one day my grandson or great grandson must take people around and say this is a museum where we used to have a disease called diabetes that is my dream that&amp;#39;s my dream ladies and gentlemen so i&amp;#39;m not saying all of you become diabetic come to me and i&amp;#39;ll treat you i am not saying that i am saying diabetes will go away but is it easy is it a magic wand like harry potter you know just you know waving his wand and diabetes goes away i wish it was and we have such a want please tell me i will also buy it and use it to treat my diabetic patients so if you look after your diet if you exercise regularly if you take your medicines properly if you sleep well and on each of these i&amp;#39;ll be making a series of videos which you will be watching soon and if you do regular monitoring looking after your glucose levels either with a glucometer or with a patch which will tell you continuous glucose monitoring and most importantly keeping in touch with your doctor because things change in your body because what happens is that today your kidney function may be normal tomorrow heaven forbid your kidney function changes it worsens then the entire treatment will have to be changed so these media people who keep saying and on social media people can don&amp;#39;t go to doctors you can google and get your medicine and take it yourself well best of luck to you if you believe in that but there&amp;#39;s a danger associated with it all of us didn&amp;#39;t study medicine for so many years we can also learn google i can teach my grandson to google better and become a google doctor it&amp;#39;s i wish life was so easy it is not so look after yourself my it is my hope and prayer that all of you live up to 100 years without any complication but for that as the main theme of today is on diet i would say diet plays a very important role i hope you enjoyed this video where we talked quite extensively about diet you will find in my channel many other videos related to other aspects of diet about exercise about lifestyle about sleep about do&amp;#39;s and don&amp;#39;ts that a person with diabetes should do so i do hope you will watch the other videos in this channel thank you [Music] you",

    "transcript": "type 2 diabetes and pre-diabetes are conditions that affect millions of people they can lead to heart disease and stroke which are the first and third leading causes of death and disability in the united states respectively people with diabetes and pre-diabetes can develop problems with their vision and lose feeling in their limbs they may develop liver and kidney disease and are at risk for stroke and heart attack however type 2 diabetes and pre-diabetes can be avoided and risk can be reversed what is diabetes diabetes is a complex disease that affects many parts of your body but is caused by the way your body mishandles the food you eat after a meal food is broken down into sugar molecules called glucose glucose travels through the intestines into the blood where it is carried to all different areas of the body and is used for energy there are some parts of your body that need help absorbing the glucose molecules and require a special hormone called insulin insulin is formed in the pancreas and circulates in the blood with glucose to the cells that need help specifically liver cells fat cells and muscle cells when the body develops resistance to insulin increasing amounts of insulin are necessary for it to be able to utilize glucose initially during insulin resistance your pancreas will work on overtime to produce more insulin this can happen even when your glucose levels are relatively normal if tests reveal abnormally high insulin levels a condition called hyperinsulinemia along with insulin resistance markers your body shows initial risk for developing diabetes lots of insulin in the blood also affects the production of lipids and lipoproteins which are the small particles that are broken down from cholesterol molecules and fat products called triglycerides these particles are small enough to travel in your bloodstream but can be dangerous in large amounts when they build up in your blood vessels in the presence of elevated levels of insulin your body especially your liver releases bad cholesterol particles such as vldl and the higher your insulin levels the more bad cholesterol particles are circulating in your bloodstream a condition called dyslipidemia furthermore adiponectin a hormone released by your fat cells that helps break down lipids in particular free fatty acids is often low in obese or insulin resistant patients prior to developing type 2 diabetes while such lipid and lipoprotein markers are traditionally tested to measure cholesterol they also provide insightful clues on the extent of insulin resistance after a while the pancreas will become overworked and the special beta cells that produce insulin will begin to die some tests will measure how well your beta cells function and if they are showing strain beta cell dysfunction means that your body can no longer make enough insulin to help your cells take up glucose for energy and high levels of glucose will remain in your blood a condition called hyperglycemia when insulin levels are low your body may react in a number of ways some of the cells that use insulin to control glucose levels have the ability to store glucose liver and muscle cells will begin to release stored glucose when insulin levels are low in order to provide the body energy without adequate levels of insulin in the presence of insulin resistance more and more glucose is released into the bloodstream and the effects of hyperglycemia are heightened markers of glycemic control are usually measured during periods of fasting when your blood sugar should be low test results that demonstrate consistently high glucose levels are the defining characteristic of pre-diabetes and diabetes to summarize how diabetes develops let&amp;#39;s review the main features high insulin levels mark the beginning of insulin resistance the primary mechanism that leads to pre-diabetes and diabetes abnormal levels of lipids lipoproteins and the hormone adiponectin may further indicate insulin resistance a drop in insulin production by the pancreas occurs from strain on the hormone-producing beta cells and beta cell dysfunction eventually leads to an insulin deficiency without adequate levels of insulin your body&amp;#39;s ability to control glucose levels is disrupted and glucose levels increase defining the onset of prediabetes and diabetes too much glucose circulating in your blood hyperglycemia and too many harmful lipids circulating in your blood dyslipidemia are two conditions that are characteristic of prediabetes and diabetes left untreated they cause serious damage to the blood vessels leading to a variety of complications excess levels of lipids and lipoprotein particles can build up to create a plaque in your blood vessels this is heightened in the presence of excess glucose molecules and free fatty acids due to blockage in your vessels blood cannot circulate to your limbs and the nutrients and oxygen carried by your blood cannot nourish your body&amp;#39;s extremities build up causes the vessels to expand and squeeze the nerves that course alongside them leading to a condition called neuropathy damaged nerves can cause numbness and keep you from healing normally they can cause your muscles to weaken and eventually atrophy sometimes requiring amputation and you may experience sensory changes including blindness involuntary functions such as blood pressure and heart rate and even sexual function may become abnormal as a symptom of neuropathy in large vessels like those supplying your heart and your brain plaque buildup leads to a condition called atherosclerosis over time the plaque can grow and rupture which can cause cardiovascular disease or a heart attack or in the brain can lead to a stroke atherosclerosis further contributes to end-organ damage like kidney or liver disease [Music] you",

    "transcript": "when I was back in college I had a physiology Professor that said if you live long enough you&amp;#39;re gonna get diabetes Well it is estimated that over 530 million adults worldwide have diabetes and those numbers are also increasing in Children and adolescents so was this professor onto something or is there something else going on here so in today&amp;#39;s video we&amp;#39;ll definitely utilize the cadavers behind me to talk about what diabetes is and what causes it we&amp;#39;ll also talk about things that you can do to reduce your risk of developing diabetes and if you already have it is there a possible way to cure diabetes it&amp;#39;s going to be an interesting one so let&amp;#39;s do this foreign diabetes or diabetes mellitus is often classified into one of two types now there is gestational diabetes but we&amp;#39;re going to mostly discuss type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes and we&amp;#39;ll talk about the various differences but whenever you have a conversation about diabetes you have to talk about the pancreas so let&amp;#39;s take a look at a real human pancreas and just to orient you we&amp;#39;re going to be looking in from the left upper abdomen so you can see coming in from the left side here here&amp;#39;s the liver we&amp;#39;ll reflect that away and then you can also see the stomach here we&amp;#39;ll reflect that in posterior or behind the stomach you can see how amazing this pancreas is now this is the head of the pancreas the body and then moving on to the tail down here and I can lift that up so you can see that a little bit better now the pancreas is amazing for multiple reasons but one of the cool things about it is that it is both an endocrine gland as well as an exocrine gland endocrine glands secrete hormones into the bloodstream but the exocrine portion if we were to look at this or look at it under the microscope we&amp;#39;d find clusters of extra in cells that will produce pancreatic enzymes and those would be secreted into the small intestine specifically the duodenum right here and that&amp;#39;s going to help aid in digestion but the endocrine portion of the pancreas is where we&amp;#39;re going to focus on we&amp;#39;ll talk about the exocrine pancreas in another video but the endocrine portion or those Endocrine cells within the pancreas those are going to produce various hormones and secrete them into the bloodstream and one of the main hormones that we&amp;#39;re focused on in this case is insulin now insulin has various functions but the function we&amp;#39;re going to mostly focus on is that insulin lowers blood glucose levels what many simply just refer to as blood sugar levels now we need to go into a little bit more detail on how this insulin applies to the different types of diabetes and in order for us to do that we&amp;#39;re going to utilize my whiteboard picture so full disclosure I technically traced this pink pancreas as well as the first part of the small intestine when I don&amp;#39;t trace things you guys get stuck with me creating human cells that look like smiley faces but for our purposes in this diagram this will suffice but you can totally tell the outside of this is representing this cell membrane and we even have surface receptors here these green receptors are representing insulin receptors which will be important in just a second so when we eat or ingest carbohydrates our digestive tract will break that down and eventually those carbs will get absorbed into the bloodstream as glucose and we have a blood vessel represented here in these black dots are representing glucose molecules which contribute to the blood sugar levels now the pancreas in response to those blood sugar levels increasing after the meal will release insulin and insulins represented in this blue triangle this will get into the bloodstream and so the insulin can then circulate and go to the various cells throughout the body and the insulin will bind to these insulin receptors and essentially we&amp;#39;ll tell the cell this sugar or in other words take the sugar in and the cell obliges and that glucose goes into the cell so you can see how insulin would therefore lower the blood sugar levels by getting the sugar to go from the bloodstream and into the cells but what does this have to do with Diabetes Type 1 diabetes which is also often referred to as insulin dependent diabetes and that&amp;#39;s because the pancreas is no longer creating insulin we get this autoimmune destruction of the beta cells and the beta cells are the specific cell type within the pancreas that actually creates the insulin so we no longer get this insulin and no longer can create this effect of the cell and so you can see we are not going to be able to shuttle that glucose from the bloodstream and into the cell and we might as well fix this part of the picture as well get this unhappy cell here now with type 1 diabetes it actually only accounts for about five to ten percent of the overall cases of diabetes and it typically happens in children and sometimes into early teenage years it can also sometimes happen later in life but most commonly in the younger years of life now what&amp;#39;s interesting is we are going to talk about potential risk factors or things that you could do to reduce your risk of getting diabetes with type 1 diabetes we don&amp;#39;t get a lot of control with that remember I mentioned this autoimmune destruction of the beta cells so we&amp;#39;re essentially getting this combination of genetics and bad luck which is causing type 1 diabetes however that is a bit different when we talk about type 2 diabetes but before we go into the details of type 2 diabetes I want to take a second to say thank you to the sponsor of today&amp;#39;s video athletic greens athletic greens is a nutrition company that makes an amazing nutritional drink called ag1 ag1 is more than just a green powder yes you will get your blend of greens but with 75 ingredients you&amp;#39;ll also get vitamins minerals probiotics superfoods and adaptogens and this is super convenient I&amp;#39;ve been taking this for months now all I do get up in the morning take my scoop dump it in eight ounces of water shake it up and I&amp;#39;m good to go some of my favorite benefits of ag1 is that it can help support performance during exercise as well as aid in recovery afterwards it can also help boost your energy levels and since I don&amp;#39;t take in a lot of caffeine any boost in energy is definitely a plus for me it&amp;#39;s also NSF certified which means what&amp;#39;s on the label is actually going to be found in the product so if you&amp;#39;re interested in this go to athleticgreens.com human anatomy and they&amp;#39;ll give our audience a free one-year supply of immune supporting vitamin D as well as five free travel packets we&amp;#39;ll also include that link in the description below so back to type 2 diabetes which is also often referred to as non-insulin dependent diabetes and that&amp;#39;s because the pancreas still is actually producing the insulin so in other words we do have this insulin here let&amp;#39;s get that back in there and so therefore insulin will still continue to have its effects on the cell here it&amp;#39;s just in the case of if I can draw that triangle in there in the case of type 2 diabetes what happens is that the cells actually become insensitive or resistant to the effects of insulin so we have this insulin trying to get the cell to take in the glucose and the cell might do something like this and say to the insulin which is not very nice of the cell but you can see that because of this we get a very similar result that we saw in type 1 diabetes and that is the blood glucose levels will increase and get too high now what&amp;#39;s interesting about type 2 diabetes in the initial stages the pancreas will actually secrete more insulin or almost overcompensate in efforts to almost kind of think of it as trying to wake up the cells especially with our cartoon drawing here you could think of it as trying to convince the cell to take the glucose in if it pushes it with more insulin but over time with diabetes especially type 2 if it&amp;#39;s not well managed the pancreas will eventually start to wear out if you think of it that way and will not be able to secrete as much insulin to the point where if this continues and someone doesn&amp;#39;t manage their type 2 diabetes Well they may have to start taking insulin similar to what someone with type 1 diabetes would have to do but back to this whole idea about this insensitivity or this resistance to insulin what is causing this well we&amp;#39;re going to find that there are are some things that you don&amp;#39;t have any control over but some things that you do have some control over so the risk factors that we don&amp;#39;t have any control over mostly center around genetics so things like family history and even certain ethnicities have been shown to have a higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes so for example say you had a first degree relative so a parent or a sibling that had type 2 diabetes that would increase your risk of developing type 2 diabetes by as much as two or three fold now that doesn&amp;#39;t mean someone with a family history or certain ethnicities that are at higher risk are just doomed to get type 2 diabetes because there are some other risk factors that we do have control over one of those being the amount of adipose tissue as adipose or fatty tissue increases this strongly correlates with an increased risk of developing insulin resistance and therefore type 2 diabetes but you might be thinking well why what is it about this increase in adipose tissue that leads to an increased risk of type 2 diabetes caused by this insulin resistance well there&amp;#39;s data in research that suggests that the adipose cells release these chemicals called adipocines and as adipose tissue increases we also get an increase in these chemicals the adipocines and these adipocines are these chemicals tend to make the cells throughout the body more resistant to that insulin what also strongly correlates or supports this correlation between an increase of Adipose and type 2 diabetes is that someone with type 2 diabetes as they decrease their adipose or fatty tissue or in other words lose weight they&amp;#39;re type 2 diabetes and insulin resistance often improves So based on all this information you can probably see that yes we definitely can help prevent and reduce our risk of developing type 2 diabetes and you probably even have some ideas on how we can do this now some may simply just want to say hey let&amp;#39;s lose the fat or the adipose tissue and yes that is true but there&amp;#39;s a bit more to it than just saying hey lose the fat one easier said than done and two we do have to acknowledge that there are is a genetic component to how much adipose tissue one has but we also also have to acknowledge that we definitely have some control over this and most of us will think well we control this by the two things that we always hear about and that is diet and exercise now one of the interesting things about diet is that us humans sometimes fall into this Quest if you will this quest for the perfect diet maybe you got all excited in gung-ho about a keto diet vegetarian maybe the Mediterranean diet whatever the diet was you were so excited to be ingesting all of this healthy food you&amp;#39;re going to be so healthy and be able to resist virtually any health condition cancer police diabetes get out of here oh and World Peace we&amp;#39;ve got you covered too because everyone throughout the world is going to be so happy about your diet rant over but the key point is there is not one Magic Bullet diet out there for everyone there are plenty of people that live long healthy lives reduce and mitigate their risk for things like diabetes with a variety of different diets are there general principles absolutely one being that the majority of our food should come from Whole Foods Source whole food sources to whatever those food choices are you want to make sure that we get all the proper vitamins and minerals to have proper physiological function and then also the macronutrients we want to make sure we have the proper proportions of those the macronutrients being carbohydrates proteins and fats and of course those proportions would have the ceiling of a total caloric intake and we&amp;#39;d want that total caloric intake to be in what we&amp;#39;d refer to as a calorie deficit meaning we&amp;#39;re burning more calories than we&amp;#39;re taking in especially if part of our goal here is to reduce weight or reduce the adipose tissue now I do want to acknowledge again that I did just go on this rant saying there&amp;#39;s no magic bullet when it comes to diet but this is also true for our overall health and wellness there&amp;#39;s no diet magic bullet or treatment option that&amp;#39;s a Magic Bullet or whatever it may be but if you me pick a Magic Bullet or if we thought of it as what&amp;#39;s the closest thing we could get to a Magic Bullet for our health and wellness that would have to be exercise and let me explain what I mean by that exercise is going to pay more dividends than just helping us decrease or lose adipose tissue when it comes to this type 2 diabetes discussion think of type 2 diabetes as this dysfunction of metabolism we have these cells that are resistant to insulin and so therefore cannot bring the glucose or the carbohydrates in so therefore the cells aren&amp;#39;t processing utilizing metabolizing those carbohydrates properly and because of that dysfunction metabolism it&amp;#39;s also going to trickle into how our body metabolizes the fats as well as the proteins but exercise changes our metabolism now one of the things that changes with exercise is that metabolic rate increases with exercise and that would mean we&amp;#39;d burn through more calories in that case which has its obvious benefits but you&amp;#39;ve probably started to gather that there&amp;#39;s more to metabolism than just how fast we burn through carbohydrates or fats it also includes how effectively we process or utilize those carbohydrates fats and even the proteins let me give you some examples of how this improves with exercise we know that the majority of cells throughout the body need insulin to bring the glucose in including like a resting muscle cell but say that resting muscle cell starts to exercise and the overall muscle begins to exercise your exercising muscles can bring in glucose without the need of insulin which is pretty amazing to think about also there&amp;#39;s this window directly after exercise where the muscle tissue becomes highly sensitive to the effects of insulin again remarkable to think about especially when we&amp;#39;re comparing that to type 2 diabetes where the cells are less sensitive or resistant to the effects of insulin and it makes sense that an exercising muscle or a muscle post exercise would be sensitized because it&amp;#39;s trying to replenish its glycogen stores which glycogen is just the storage form of glucose and those muscle cells are also ready to bring in protein for that rebuilding process now this is just looking at it from one isolated incident like meaning one day of exercise what about consistent exercise over the long term if you consistently exercise further changes will occur for example the number of mitochondria Within the muscle tissue will increase and you might remember from biology class that the mitochondria was nicknamed the PowerHouse of the cell because this helped create the energy currency of the cell called adenosine triphosphate or ATP we&amp;#39;ll also see that the number of enzymes involved in metabolism will increase within the muscle we&amp;#39;ll see cellular Transporters increase all of these things are essentially going to help us to process more carbohydrates and fats as well as the process and metabolize them more effectively and this is kind of like the opposite of the metabolism that&amp;#39;s occurring with type 2 diabetes and this is what I was talking about as far as exercise paying more dividends we see more effective metabolism even increased insulin sensitivity within the muscle tissue and with that increased metabolism that can often trickle into just from frequent exercise to decreasing that adipose tissue which was contributing to insulin resistance and if that goes down insulin resistance often improves and finally let&amp;#39;s talk basics of treatment as well as the size idea of can you possibly cure diabetes Well let&amp;#39;s start with the treatment of type 1 diabetes now we haven&amp;#39;t talked as much about type 1 because remember we didn&amp;#39;t have as much control at reducing the risk of type 1 diabetes and because the pancreas isn&amp;#39;t secreting insulin with type 1 diabetes we&amp;#39;re left with one main treatment option and that is replenishing the insulin through injection and the amount of insulin corresponds with carbohydrate intake now type 2 diabetes we&amp;#39;ve actually talked a bit about a treatment option because that&amp;#39;s similar to prevention which is diet and exercise but on top of diet and exercise people will often get initiated on a diabetic medication Metformin is the most common medication now we could do a video on multiple different types of diabetic medications so instead we&amp;#39;ll just put some of the most common in the description below and kind of jump to this idea of can you possibly cure type 2 diabetes because people have come off of their diabetic medications through diet exercise and weight loss or sometimes people have done it through say like a gastric bypass surgery so you might be thinking well their insulin resistance is improved their blood sugar levels are where they need to be they&amp;#39;re no longer on their diabetic medication they&amp;#39;re cured well not so fast we don&amp;#39;t usually use the word cure when it comes to type 2 diabetes the word that is used is remission and I think that&amp;#39;s fair because we&amp;#39;re talking about remission because this could come back say like adipose tissue came back or increased again diet and exercise started to falter on that and even aging can make us a little bit more at risk for developing this and so in that case remission is typically the word that is used but I think that&amp;#39;s still really remarkable to think about that a person can improve so much that they can come off of their diabetic medications and maintain this with diet and exercise guys thank you for watching today&amp;#39;s video and for the support that you guys give to our Channel it really does mean a lot if you&amp;#39;re interested in athletic greens go ahead and check out that link in the description below and of course all the usual stuff if you feel like

Because the insulin deficiency or the insulin resistance in a diabetic patient impacts the transport of glucose (energy-releasing molecule) from blood to the body cells Therefore there is decreased production of energy in the body cells And so the patient is hungry all the time or he/she is tired all the time The second common symptom is an increased frequency of urination In Diabetic patient, the normal urine frequency (which is 6-8 per day) gets increased up 14-16/day Increased frequency of urination leads to  dehydration in the patient, the patient feels dehydrated And because of this dehydration, there is an \nincrease in thirst he/she feels thirsty all the time Due to this their water consumption increases And this increased water consumption in medical terms is called Polydipsia And the patient develops dry skin due to dehydration and this leads to itching and irritation on the skin Besides, the infections increase in Diabetic patients particularly the frequency of urinary tract infections and skin infections increase Besides, the patients may develop blurring of vision and, burning, numbness, tingling of hands and feet In severe cases, patient develops nausea, vomiting, and severe pain in the abdomen These were some early symptoms which develop a suspicion of Diabetes And if these symptoms develop in  a patient, he/she should get an urgent consultation with a Good Doctor and get their complete evaluation done So this completes the discussion And stay healthy and keep your blood sugar levels under control Thank You, Take Care",

    "transcript": "several recent media articles reported that eating dark chocolate reduces your risk of type 2 diabetes of course this made me wonder whether this is just a typical media hype or whether there is any scientific substance behind it for this video I took a closer look and reviewed the scientific evidence for you if you share my passion for either chocolate or diabetes prevention you will find this video informative and I dare say actionable [Music] [Music] welcome to ner by science on YouTube my name is Mario and in this video we will talk about cocoa and dark chocolate and their relationship to glucose tolerance and type 2 diabetes risk last month I suddenly saw headlines everywhere proclaiming that dark chocolate could help you ward of type 2 diabetes or excitedly stating how sweet a daily dose of dark chocolate may cut your risk of diabetes and when even the New York Times asked whether dark chocolate could reduce your risk of diabetes I figured I got to look into this some more it turned out that the flood of headlines was all based on a new observational study so we&amp;#39;ll review that one first and consider it in a context of the entire available evidence to see whether there is any substance to the hype dark chocolate intake is associated with a lower risk of type 2 diabetes early last month a new paper was published based on three large cohorts the nurses health study the nurses health study 2 and the health professionals follow-up study overall they had data from 11,654 participants from these three cohorts none of these had diabetes at Baseline and they were observed for more than 40 years during that time their dietry intakes and other lifestyle factors were assessed every four years this analysis aimed to investigate whether chocolate consumption was related to the risk of developing type 2 diabetes during the follow-up period quite an impressive study very large very long follow-up and repeated assessments of dietry intakes the key finding was that milk chocolate consumption was not associated with type 2 diabetes risk however dark chocolate consumption was associated with type 2 diabetes risk specifically those participants who consumed the most dark chocolate five servings per week or more a serving being 1 ooun or 30 G had a significantly lower risk of developing type 2 diabetes during the follow-up period in fact at 21% % lower risk in those consuming five servings per week or more or Express differently per one serving of dark chocolate per week the risk was reduced by about 3% this is certainly a very meaningful difference in risk and this was after adjustment for other type 2 diabetes risk factors as well as potential confounding factors what are confounding factors well I&amp;#39;m glad you asked we&amp;#39;ll get to that in a minute what does a finding like this mean if we look at some of the media articles written about this study it seems that some people immediately came to the conclusion that this study proves that dark chocolate causes us to have better glucose tolerance and a lower risk of type 2 diabetes I certainly don&amp;#39;t agree with that conclusion this was a good study with adequate analyses but it&amp;#39;s just one study and every study has limitations if there&amp;#39;s one thing that is clear from nutrition research and Science in general it is that even the best studies sometimes produce results that are at odds with each other I&amp;#39;m discussing the limitations of this particular study in some detail in the blog post associated with this video for now let me just highlight one potential concern imagine that this had been a randomized control trial where the 110,000 participants had been randomized to either consume no dark chocolate or varying amounts of dark chocolate over 40 years that would have been a much stronger study design because in that case we could be certain that dark chocolate consumption was the only real difference between the groups this is not the case in an observational study in fact in this study people who ate the most dark chocolate seemed to have a generally healthier lifestyle than those who did not eat any dark chocolate this is sometimes called the healthy user bias for example people eating more dark chocolate had a higher level of physical activity and an overall healthier diet than those who didn&amp;#39;t now scientists can try to measure such additional factors and adjust for them statistically but the concern remains that they may have been unable to reliably measure these other factors well or maybe there are factors they didn&amp;#39;t even think of measuring so what remains is a risk that we call residual or unmeasured confounding with confounding meaning confusion of effects for example the data don&amp;#39;t rule out the possibility that those who ate the most dark chocolate also meditated regularly and maybe it&amp;#39;s the meditation that actually lowered the risk of type 2 diabetes so when we see the association between dark chocolate and a lower risk of type 2 diabetes we may think that eating dark chocolate causes us to have a lower risk but what may really be going on is that the meditation that dark chocolate eaters more often engage in is what actually causes the risk to be lower I&amp;#39;m not saying that this is the case here but with an observational study we can never be 100% certain that something like this is not going on so yes an obser ational study does provide some insights but I would consider this more hypothesis generating this means that these results should be used to create a hypothesis that dark chocolate May reduce type 2 diabetes risk but by itself this study does not give me a high degree of confidence that this is definitely the case so what we need to do is look for other studies on the topic other observational evidence we do have data from two additional cohorts for one the multiethnic cohort with about 52,000 participants also found that those eating the most chocolate had a lower risk of type 2 diabetes in that study they did not differentiate between dark chocolate and milk chocolate they looked at all chocolates together and found that those eating chocolate at least four times per week and an average of 10 G or more per day had the lowest risk of developing type 2 diabetes a second study was much smaller with about a thousand participants over 30 years of followup those who consumed the most chocolate at the lowest risk of developing type 2 diabetes taken together we have three observational studies that describe lower risks of type 2 diabetes in people eating the most chocolate the data are a bit inconclusive in that two studies did not differentiate between dark and milk chocolate but I&amp;#39;d say together they do strengthen the hypothesis that there may be something about chocolate that could be beneficial for glucose tolerance now why do I say beneficial for glucose tolerance none of these studies looked at glucose tolerance per se that&amp;#39;s correct these studies looked at type 2 diabetes risk but if someone develops type 2 diabetes this means by definition that they have elevated blood glucose levels and elevated blood glucose levels only occur if someone is glucose intolerant and we further know that in the context of type 2 diabetes glucose intolerance means that the person is insulin resistant and has some degree of beta cell dysfunction meaning they cannot make enough insulin for their reduced level of insulin sensitivity ity if any of this is unclear check my video about the regulation of blood sugar linked Below in which I explain all of this in detail it is clear that if dark chocolate or chocolate in general indeed lowers the long-term risk of developing type 2 diabetes in other words if there is a cause effect relationship underlying the association observed in these observational studies then we should be able to see an effect of eating chocolate on glucose tolerance insur resistance and beta cell function in a shortterm randomized controlled feeding study let&amp;#39;s have a look if we have any evidence for this the effect of dark chocolate on glucose tolerance randomized control trials we indeed have data from four randomized control trials in which investigators assessed the impact of dark chocolate on measures of insulin resistance three of these had an almost identical study design so let&amp;#39;s talk about these first people with insum resistance were randomized to one of two groups one group first consumed one bar of dark chocolate daily for 15 days along with the normal diet after a short wash out period where they didn&amp;#39;t consume any chocolate they then consumed one bar of white chocolate with the same calorie content also for 15 days fasting blood was drawn at the end of each period to measure insulin resistance the second group also completed both phases but in reverse order we call this a randomized controlled crossover design and it&amp;#39;s a particularly strong study design because we can compare each person&amp;#39;s insulin resistance on one diet to their insulin resistance on another diet because people were randomized here we can ensure that everyone consumed dark chocolate in the dark chocolate phase not just people who otherwise have a healthy lifestyle now what were the results in all three studies as measured by hom IR insulin resistance was substantially and significantly lower after participants had consumed the dark chocolate and in one of the studies where the researchers also measured insulin secretion in response to an all grost tus test beta cell function was also improved in response to eating dark chocolate compared to white chocolate in that study the investigators also observed an improvement in glucose tolerance such that the blood glucose response was consistently lower in response to drinking a beverage sweetened with 75 gram of pure glucose after participants had completed the 15-day dark chocolate phase one limitation of these studies was that they were pretty short with each intervention period just lasting 15 days for fortunately we have data from a trial in which participants were randomized to either consume dark chocolate 27 G or about an ounce per day or a non-chocolate control with the same number of calories for one year in that study participants had type 2 diabetes and insulin resistance at Baseline as in the shorter trials H was significantly reduced in participants after they had consumed the dark chocolate these are pretty interesting and very consistent results strongly suggesting that there is something in dark chocolate that is not in white chocolate that improves insulin sensitivity beta cell function and glucose tolerance let&amp;#39;s discuss what that may be what could it be about dark chocolate that improves insulin sensitivity and glucose Toons what is the difference between dark chocolate and white chocolate both types of chocolate typically contain cocoa butter which is essentially just a fat and both typically contain some sugar even though white chocolate usually has a lot more sugar than dark chocolate white chocolate also contains milk which is usually absent from dark chocolate the biggest and most obvious difference is that dark chocolate contains the non-fat parts of the cocoa bean in the form of cocoa liquor or cocoa powder and these contain a wide range of very interest interesting substances that deserve to be discussed briefly in general the substances of Interest belong to a very large family of chemicals in plant foods that we often call secondary plant compounds these are simply molecules that the plant makes that are not strictly necess Neary for its most basic functions to us secondary plant compounds are relevant because many of these have various effects on the human body a particular group of these secondary plant compounds are phenols which include polyphenols there are a lot of other secondary plant compounds but for now let&amp;#39;s focus on polyphenols you may have heard of these polyphenols we find these in many foods such as olive oil fruits and vegetables black and green tea red wine and cocoa again there are a number of different classes of polyphenols but particularly interesting ones in Coco are called flavonoids and within flavonoids Coco has some called flavanol and it&amp;#39;s the very high flavanol content that many researchers believe could be responsible for the anti-diabetic effect of cocoa and dark chocolate now earlier I shared that dark chocolate reduces insulin resistance and improves beta cell function in randomized control to trials leading to improved glucose tolerance how could flavanol in Cocoa be responsible for this well there can be numerous different causes of insulin resistance and beta cell dysfunction but one commonality that is almost always seen in insulin resistant tissues and also in Dysfunctional beta cells is what we call mitochondrial dysfunction mitochondria are the power plants of each cell in which the cell converts fuel such as glucose and fat to the chemical form of energy ATP we observe that this process doesn&amp;#39;t work properly in insulin resistant muscle cells and Insulin resistant liver cells and similarly in beta cells that are unable to secrete enough insulin we also often find such mitochondrial dysfunction another common observation in these cells is what we call oxidative stress characterized by an accumulation of reactive oxygen species or RW and this is where flavanol from cocoa may come into play flavanol are potent antioxidants and they may be able to deal with reactive oxygen species and remove or reduce their damaging effects on the mitochondria and that would be expected to improve mitochondrial function so while no study has ever shown that this is the exact mechanism through which dark chocolate consumption improves glucose tolerance it&amp;#39;s one potential mechanism that is supported by a bunch of indirect pieces of evidence that I have discussed in more detail in the blog post for here suffice to say that I think we have a potential mechanism for an effect of dark chocolate on glucose tolerance and type 2 diabetes risk so another fitting piece in the puzzle well if this is indeed how dark chocolate improves glucose tolerance and reduces type 2 diabetes risk then we should be able to see similar effects from consuming cocoa in other forms for example as a beverage and we can also isolate Coco flavanols and see if these in isolation affect glucose Torrance let&amp;#39;s have a look at whether we have studies testing this the effect of Coco or Coco flavanol on insulin resistance randomized control trials we indeed have data from six public randomized control trials in which participants consumed a cocoa beverage usually specifically picked to have a high flavanol content compared to a control beverage with the same calories but a low flavanol content and indeed in three of these we do see reductions in insulin resistance in participants consuming the high flavanol cocoa beverages the three other studies did not detect an effect of drinking a cocoa beverage on insulin resistance in one of these however participants were perfect perly insolent sensitive at Baseline and the problem is that even the most skilled mechanic cannot fix a car that is not broken so I would argue that any effect the cocoa may have on insulin resistance cannot manifest in people who are not insulin resistant another study also did not detect an effect on flavanol Rich cocoa on insulin resistance but that study was extremely short with participants drinking cocoa only for 5 days which may simply have been too little time to make a difference so we only have one study out of six that was conducted in insulin resistant people who consumed flavonol Rich cocoa for 4 weeks which should be long enough that didn&amp;#39;t detect the reduction in insulin resistance I have discussed these trials in more detail in the blog post for here suffice to say that cumulatively these suggest that in insulin resistant people cocoa when consumed as a beverage regularly over more than just a few days seems to induce similar improvements in insulin sensitivity and as we&amp;#39;ve seen with dark chocolate the effect of cocoa flavonol on type 2 diabetes risk randomized control trials and lastly we do have data from a long-term randomized control trial in which participants were given either isolated cocoa flavanol in a pill every day or a placebo pill this study was called the cosmos trial and included 18,38 older men and women who were free of diabetes at Bas line and they were followed for 3 and 1/2 years the study outcome here was the development of type 2 diabetes so this was the largest of the randomized control trials and it didn&amp;#39;t look at insulin sensitivity beta cell function or glucose Torrance but directly at who did and did not develop type two diabetes and considering how consistent the observational studies and randomized control trials we have discussed so far have been I think it&amp;#39;s fair to say that many researchers expected that the Coco flavanol supplement would lower type 2 diabetes risk unfortunately it didn&amp;#39;t the researchers detected no effect not even a little hint that isolated Coco flavanol had any impact on type 2 diabetes risk summary and conclusions what do we make of this well I&amp;#39;d say that the data on dark chocolate and cocoa are so consistent that I would conclude that eating dark chocolate or consuming cocoa as a beverage does improve insulin sensitivity in people who are insulin resistant and possibly also improve beta cell function resulting in improved glucose tolerance and a lower risk of type 2 diabetes why the cosmos trial was null and did not detect any effect of isolated Coco flavanol remains unclear maybe there is more to Coco than flavanols if the cosmos trial had shown a reduction in type 2 diabetes risk with Coco flavanol supplementation the story would have been very conclusive cocoa in the form of a beverage or dark chocolate improves glucose tolerance and reduces type two diabetes risk through the action of the flavonol and cocoa now now that this trial was soundly negative showing no effect whatsoever the story is less conclusive and we remain a little unclear about what it is about dark chocolate and cocoa that exert the effect on glucose tolerance as a takeaway message I would still conclude that if you like dark chocolate or cocoa as a beverage it would seem fine to enjoy these regularly just keep in mind that eating or drinking huge amounts every day doesn&amp;#39;t necessarily mean a bigger effect my suggestion would be to have say two to maybe four squares of dark chocolate per day with a cocoa content of at least say 80% maybe I think that dark chocolate could have a particularly positive effect on your diabetes risk and your health in general if it replaces other types of desserts or snacks higher in sugar or fat such as cookies cakes or Donuts if you prefer cocoa as a beverage that may also be a good option but keep the sugar content to a minimum now why do I recommend only two to four squares per day and not more didn&amp;#39;t I mention that several trials used one bar of dark chocolate per day for a couple of weeks yes sure and I think in those studies a high dose was probably needed to detect an effect in a relatively short-term study for long-term potentially lifelong consumption I think there are a few other things we should consider for one it&amp;#39;s important to consider that the sugar cocoa is often consumed with is not great in larger amounts particularly if you are concerned about blood glucose control also dark chocolate is a food with a high energy density and as I&amp;#39;ve explained before a high energy density means that chocolate has a low satil score per calorie in other words eating too much of such a food could easily lead to an overc consumption of calories and weight gain and that is certainly not great for diabetes prevention or health in general and lastly cocoa can contain a high concentration of heavy metals such as lead and cadmium and it&amp;#39;s very high in the an nutrient oxalate for heavy metals and also oxalates our bodies can probably manage small amounts but going overboard and having a bar of dark chocolate or more every day because you now think of chocolate as a superfood could carry some risks to me it does seem likely that enjoying a reasonable amount of say two squares and not more than around four squares per day regularly is may be a sweet spot for your enjoyment of the food with some health benefits while keeping potential risks at a minimum okay

    "transcript": "hey guys welcome to sugar md channel today we are talking about the effect of thyroid hormones on your diabetes or glucose metabolism this is dr ahmed ergan i&amp;#39;m an endocrinologist and a diabetes specialist let&amp;#39;s dive into thyroid and diabetes related issues now so guys before we jump to the topic i want to encourage you to take the quiz in the description below to win a chapter from my diabetes book let&amp;#39;s move on okay guys so here&amp;#39;s why you need to get your thyroid tested now both hyper which is too much thyroid and hypo which is too a little thyroid can actually affect if not cause diabetes so how does that happen now hyperthyroidism overactive thyroid it could be within you it could be from graves disease or a toxic nodular goiter or something like that that increases your thyroid within you right that&amp;#39;s hyperthyroidism that can happen to anyone you know with some genetic inheritance and so forth uh sometimes you don&amp;#39;t even need the genetic inheritance there&amp;#39;s something called acute thyroiditis and suddenly boom it&amp;#39;s like a thyroid flu and your thyroid goes out of whack and then it goes back to normal now that is induced within your body but also studies indicate that up to 30 to 40 percent of people in primary care setting are treated the patients are treated excessively by their primary care providers it could be either primary care provider is not checking the thyroid function enough or the the patients are forcing doctors to give more thyroid hormone or whatever the reason it may be it is very common for over treatment to happen now we call that iatrogenic so in the use by the medical system right so what happens when there&amp;#39;s too much thyroid in the system regardless of the cause your body will become more insulin resistant your body will break down more proteins are going to lose protein and muscle you are going to also break down the lipids but also you are going to at the same time increase lipid production so it&amp;#39;s weird the way thai wood works it kind of makes two things together breaks it and makes it but then depending on the overall underactive thyroid situation the end result is different in hyperthyroidism for example everything becomes faster so the building becomes faster and degradation becomes faster as well so in muscle when it comes to muscle and protein degradation dominates and you end up losing muscle same thing actually happens you know other people tend to overuse thyroid to lose weight which is not the greatest idea because you&amp;#39;re losing muscle as well but it helps with the with the lipid loss as well on the other hand it actually suppresses the insulin production and and goes against your insulin so it makes the insulin resistant so suddenly your medications may not work enough or if you&amp;#39;re not on medication and you&amp;#39;re doing everything with diet you may be like what&amp;#39;s going on why is my blood sugar suddenly going up now of course hyperthyroidism can cause a lot of other symptoms so the high glucose level is not the only one but when you are hypothyroid what&amp;#39;s interesting your body absorbs the glucose a lot faster and then your blood sugar will spike a lot faster too but when you are hyperthyroid some people develop symptoms not everybody but some people will develop symptoms like excessive sweating heart racing weight loss irritability anxiety anger hot flashes and so forth so d or even shaking the hands and so forth so if it is coming quick you may kind of realize that but if the hyperthyroidism is kind of building in slowly you may not realize those symptoms but you may still be affected so when my patient&amp;#39;s diabetes control goes out of whack uh i always check their thyroid if not you know in the we try to check it you know if they have any symptoms typically primary care doctors do screenings but if i don&amp;#39;t see any thyroid ever checked i sometimes check that too to make sure that&amp;#39;s not contributing factor but definitely if diabetes control is worsening hypothyroidism is definitely one factor that that your doctor and you should be looking into now what does the hypothyroidism does hypothyroidism is under active thyroid that can happen from hashimoto&amp;#39;s thyroiditis like your body is attacking your own thyroid for example that&amp;#39;s hashimoto&amp;#39;s thyroiditis it may be iodine deficiency it may be other factors you know even surgery for example you know somebody that has a bunch of nodules the doctor says you know what it&amp;#39;s too much let&amp;#39;s take it out and then boom you&amp;#39;re hypothyroid now of course you know you&amp;#39;re when you&amp;#39;re hypothyroid you need to be replaced you know doctors replace it but sometimes you know either patient doesn&amp;#39;t take the medication right or they skip medications or doctor doesn&amp;#39;t prescribe drug medication whatever the the reason may be if you are hypothyroid your tsh will be higher especially that&amp;#39;s the most sensitive hormone i don&amp;#39;t want to get into the details of all the thyroid hormones here but the tsh is the most important one that will go higher now if your tsh is very high like above 10 that can definitely affect your diabetes now how does it affect it especially if you&amp;#39;re on medications your medications half-life will be longer if you&amp;#39;re on insulin for example you may develop low blood sugar way faster because when you are hypothyroid everything becomes slower you will realize that you will be slow you are gonna be like lethargic sleepy your reflexes will be slow uh you&amp;#39;re gonna your metabolism will slow down and you&amp;#39;re gonna end up basically gaining weight as well now what&amp;#39;s interesting is you&amp;#39;re gaining weight but at the same time your diabetes it looks like it is getting better initially these hormones can be interesting because the way they work the hormones work differently at different levels and the duration the same hormone does not show the same effect at the at different levels and also in in the amount of time that it takes to show effect can be very different so don&amp;#39;t try to kind of try to make sense of you know why somebody may gain weight but their diabetes their blood sugars may go down again there are multiple factors that are involved but if you are hypothyroid and your levels change kind of acutely or fast your blood sugars may go down one of the factors is like your body is not going to be able to absorb sugar this is true most of the time when people are on medications and to be honest with you a lot of people with diabetes are on medication so the metabolism the breakdown of those medications will not be as fast so that can cause low blood sugars but yeah in the long term for example if you are hypothyroid and you don&amp;#39;t even have diabetes you know because of the hypothyroidism your metabolism is slow you&amp;#39;re gaining weight eventually you&amp;#39;re going to develop insulin resistance from that and that can lead to diabetes or if you&amp;#39;re a pre-diabetic that can progress you to the real diabetes as well again the hormones are a very delicate balance too much or too little of it too prolonged amount of time can definitely have harmful effects so again if you&amp;#39;re diabetic make sure your thyroid levels are good if you&amp;#39;re feeling symptoms of hyper or hypothyroidism definitely get checked and getting your thyroid levels checked once a year by your primary care doctor is a piece of cake you know if you&amp;#39;re doing physical they generally do thyroid testing and if they don&amp;#39;t do requested that&amp;#39;s not going to hurt anybody and potentially will help you okay guys so that&amp;#39;s it so give a thumbs up share this video and like and we&amp;#39;ll see you in the next one hey guys i hope you are enjoying this channel so far and i hope you subscribed already if you didn&amp;#39;t do it and if you did watch this video right there i

    "transcript": "When you have diabetes, all fruits are the “forbidden fruits,” right? WRONG! There&amp;#39;s no need to cut off fruits\nfrom your diet and miss out on all the vitamins, minerals, and nutrients they\ncan provide, not to mention the juicy sweetness missing from the typical\ndiabetes-friendly diet. So let&amp;#39;s take a look at the top 9 fruits that are the best\nto eat when you have diabetes. All right, let&amp;#39;s take a quick look at what research has to say about\nfruits and diabetes. A study by the Harvard School\nof Public Health revealed eating fruit was linked to up to 23% lower\nrisk of type 2 diabetes. Another study shows that some of the fruits have anti-obesity,\nanti-inflammatory, and anti-diabetic benefits that can even lower\nyour “bad” LDL cholesterol. Sounds great, right? But the emphasis here\nshould be on “some fruits.” Eating the wrong fruit or even overeating the right fruit can rapidly\nspike your blood sugar. So why does some fruit\nget the green light? The short answer is fiber. The fruits I&amp;#39;ll share today are loaded\nwith soluble and insoluble fiber, which as study after study shows,\nprevents blood sugar fluctuations by slowing down carb\ndigestion and absorption of glucose. So here&amp;#39;s the top 9 diabetes-friendly fruits that won&amp;#39;t send you\non an insulin rollercoaster. #1: Blueberries. A real diabetes superstar, according to the American Diabetes Association. Blueberries are about 85%\nwater with an entire cup containing only 84 calories, 15 grams of carbs,\nand 4 grams of fiber. These nutrient-dense berries are packed with vitamin C, vitamin K,\npotassium, and polyphenols that give them anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, and gut-regulating abilities. Studies also link them to improved insulin resistance and a lower risk\nof developing type 2 diabetes. #2: Tart Cherries. Tart cherries provide 60 calories, 15 grams of carbs, 13 grams\nof sugar, and 2 grams of fiber per cup. Their dark red color comes\nfrom anthocyanin, a compound that protects against heart disease,\ncancer and other diseases. They also have nine times the vitamin A\ncontent of blueberries, with one serving delivering 25%\nof the recommended daily dose. #3: Peaches. A synonym for sweetness, you&amp;#39;d hardly think of peaches\nas a diabetes-friendly fruit. One medium sized peach provides 58 calories, 14 grams of carbs,\n12 grams of sugar, and 2 grams of fiber. This one study shows that polyphenol rich peach juice combat hyperglycemia\nand insulin resistance. When you&amp;#39;re strapped for options to indulge your sweet tooth,\nnothing beats a sweet and juicy peach. As long as you don&amp;#39;t go\noverboard with it, of course. #4: Apricots. It&amp;#39;s the peaches smaller yet\nstill tart and sweet cousin. The apricot is known\nfor being rich in vitamin A, known as the &amp;quot;good eyesight vitamin.&amp;quot; It&amp;#39;s also one of the safest fruits you\ncan eat to keep your blood sugar stable. In 2 fresh apricots,\nthere are 34 calories, 8 grams of carbs, 6.5 grams of sugar,\nand 1.5 grams of fiber. This sweet summer jewel goes well in your\noatmeal, cereal, and seasonal fruit. #5: Apples. An apple a day keeps the blood sugar at bay. Rich in fiber and vitamin C, it&amp;#39;s the most popular fruit in the world\nfor a reason: it scores a 32-38 GI, which means it doesn&amp;#39;t instantly\nspike your blood sugar. One medium apple is almost 86% water\nand provides 95 calories, 25 grams of carbs, 20.6 grams\nof sugar, and 4.4 grams of fiber. It really is the perfect on the go snack that can also be thrown\ninto any salad or cereal bowl. #6: Oranges. When it comes to diabetes, comparing\napples to oranges is a smart thing to do. A juicy, sweet orange can be a healthy part of a diabetes-friendly diet,\nbut monitoring your intake is key. Just one medium-sized orange has your\ndaily requirement of vitamin C. It also provides 62 calories, 15 grams of carbs, 12 grams of sugar,\nand 3.1 grams of fiber. #7: Pears. If you ever have trouble getting enough fiber into your diet, then pears should\nbe your first pick of fruit to snack on. One medium pear has 5.5 grams of fiber, which is nearly 20%\nof the daily recommended intake. It also contains 101 calories,\n27 grams of carbs, and 21 grams of sugar. Pears, when combined with apples, have been proven to lower the risk\nof type 2 diabetes by 18%. #8: Kiwi. This tropical zesty fruit is\na real vitamin C powerhouse. Kiwi is a fiber-rich superfood that helps healthy gut bacteria thrive, indirectly\nhelping to keep blood sugar in check. It&amp;#39;s also rich in keratinoids,\nwhich help protect against heart disease. One normal sized kiwi fruit has 42 calories, 10 grams of carbs,\n2 grams of fiber, and 6 grams of sugar. #9: Grapefruit. I included this citrus fruit on this\nlist with a note of caution. One grapefruit has vitamin A, vitamin B6, potassium, and nearly an entire\nday&amp;#39;s worth of vitamin C. A medium sized grapefruit has 52 calories, 13 grams of carbs, 11 grams\nof sugar, and 2 grams of fiber. While this fruit has been proven\nto improve blood sugar control, it may negatively interact with some\nmedications, notably metformin. Consult with your doctor before\nmaking it a daily staple. There&amp;#39;s simply no need to see your food choices as black and white when there&amp;#39;s\na whole rainbow of fruit you can enjoy. Before adding any of these fruits to your\nmeal rotation, try checking your blood sugar post-meal to see\nhow they affect you. Now watch another video about essential\nvitamins and minerals for diabetes and the following one about foods\nthat help lower your blood sugar levels.",

    "transcript": "do you think exercise is good or bad and how good it is I&amp;#39;m not going to tell you walking is the best exercise for you no no no you must jog unless you jog it is not useful different people have different tastes there is no one siiz fits all in the world okay you cannot satisfy everyone if you do a 30 minute walk fairly brisk five times a week is it enough to reduce your sugar is it enough to reduce your weight no I saw a 75y old man running so I thought he&amp;#39;s 75 and he&amp;#39;s running why can&amp;#39;t I run I started running and I hurt my knee immediately because I was not used to it later on when I talked to him he said last 35 years I&amp;#39;m running now that&amp;#39;s something I didn&amp;#39;t know I just saw him and I said if he can run then I can run [Music] everything in moderation is the best for your health anything you do too much it&amp;#39;ll actually have bad consequences or unforeseen consequences on you the f a AR these are the three components of exercise what is this f a r f is for flexibility a is aerobics R is resistance training and we have recently come up with a dance form called as thander now this was perfected by my daughter Dr anjana Dr anjini Harish and our team at the Dr moans diabetes special heal Center and The Madras Diabetes Research Foundation I&amp;#39;ll play a small video for you to see of an active enjoyable dance performance you can get all the exercise that you need for the whole day [Music] hello everyone I&amp;#39;m Dr V moan and today I&amp;#39;m going to talk to you about a topic which is very popular and very common exercise now everybody knows that exercise is good in fact we did a survey we asked people in the whole city of Chennai do you think exercise is good or bad and how good it is and everybody said oh it is very good it reduces the sugar it reduces the weight it reduces blood pressure it improves heart function prevents heart attacks prevents Strokes even some cancers they knew all about it then we ask them but you exercise guess what 5 to 10% of people actually do the exercise so why is this Gap people know about the benefits of exercise and yet they are not doing it this is what I would like to call it as excusitis now itis means in medicine an inflammation conjunctivitis iritis uh something like that cytis that means the gallbladder is involved so when you use the word itis it means some diseas is there in the body giving excuses is another disease you know I&amp;#39;ll give you some simple tips how to do exercise first of all make up your mind that you&amp;#39;re going to do it and that you will be regular with it then I&amp;#39;ll tell you about how much you should do whether you should do it every day or not that&amp;#39;s another one then what exercise to do now all this is dependent on your choice I&amp;#39;m not going to tell you walking is the best exercise for you no no no you must jog unless you jog it is not useful different people have different tastes there is no one siiz fit all in the world okay you cannot satisfy everyone for one person it may be dance for one person it may be badminton or tennis or swimming different people have different people say walking is so boring but you know what I love walking I love walking and see the green spaces get the fresh air in the morning that&amp;#39;s what I love but I cannot tell everybody to do that so whatever your exercise form that you choose do it regularly now the question let&amp;#39;s take walk itself that&amp;#39;s easiest to understand isn&amp;#39;t it and not everybody can do jogging and run marathon and so on we&amp;#39;re not talking about the super fit Heroes we&amp;#39;re talking about common man armad me what should that person do as exercise now let&amp;#39;s say walk itself should the walk be for 15 minutes 30 minutes 45 minutes 1 Hour 2 hours 3 hours how much should you walk well the World Health Organization says 150 minutes per week they say if you do a 30 minute walk fairly brisk five times a week that is a minimum and is probably enough for good health is it enough to reduce your sugar is it enough to reduce your weight no you&amp;#39;ll have to do much more than that you&amp;#39;ll probably have to do 60 Minutes every day and probably do it 6 days a week if you want to reduce your sugar and to reduce your weight now you&amp;#39;ll say oh I tried walking for 1 hour next day I got pain here I got pain there and so I stopped why because you&amp;#39;re not regular you not been training your body you not made your body fit and that&amp;#39;s the reason why you had to stop because you had all these pains and so on so start slowly start with 20 minute walk slowly increase it half an hour 40 minutes you&amp;#39;re able to do 1 hour very good if you feel too tired then you have done too much when after you finish your walk you must be able to go to work without any tiredness that means you have done the right amount also don&amp;#39;t compare with somebody else who&amp;#39;s walking I made that mistake when I was much younger I saw a 75 year old man running so I thought he 75 and he is running why can&amp;#39;t I run I started running and I hurt my knee immediately because I was not used to it later on when I talked to him he said last 35 years I&amp;#39;m running now that&amp;#39;s something I didn&amp;#39;t know I just saw him and I said if he can run then I can run well if You&amp;#39; have been running for 35 years you can also do that so slowly but steadily increase it is there something called too much of exercise you&amp;#39;re overdone it definitely everything in moderation is the best for your health anything you do too much it&amp;#39;ll actually have bad consequences or unforeseen consequences on you let me give you an example now suppose you do a 30 minute walk as wh says you have reached a certain level of Fitness a certain level of benefit you keep exercising you now done 45 minutes little more benefit at 1 hour let us say you have reached the peak of your benefit now it&amp;#39;s not that forever it&amp;#39;ll keep on increasing you do 2 hours 3 hours 4 hours at some point it&amp;#39;ll Plateau that means if you do more than that you don&amp;#39;t get any benefit and after some time it&amp;#39;ll actually go down the benefit will go down the risk will increase you may either hurt your ankle or hurt your muscles or tear your muscles or hurt your knees or put too much pressure on the heart so for everything there is moderation do it regularly slowly Build It Up find the level at which you are comfortable we say pain no gain suppose you do some exercise which is resulting in severe pain you&amp;#39;re overdone it you&amp;#39;re doing too much don&amp;#39;t compare somebody else who says no no no I ran and then nothing happened to him that&amp;#39;s his problem your problem is that you have to decide how much you have to do that you can do regularly you know what happens when you exercise something called lactic acid accumulates in your muscles because when you start exercising rapidly this lactic acid starts accumulating that is what is producing the pain if you give it a day&amp;#39;s rest the muscles all come back the lactic acid goes away and you&amp;#39;re able to continue your exercise without any Interruption and without any side effects so always listen to your body your body will tell you how much exercise you should do don&amp;#39;t do more than that and if possible don&amp;#39;t do less than that regularity is the key and you have to regularly do your exercise slowly increase your performance and you will find you&amp;#39;ll be surprised if you look back on your history if you&amp;#39;re keeping a diary you&amp;#39;ll say my God I could not even do this 3 months ago see how much I have improved some people like cycling so they keep taking up cycling and lot of people all over India have now got fancy Cycles sometimes ordinary Cycles they form groups of cyclists one of the tips I&amp;#39;d like to tell you is if you have a small group a small peer group I have a peer group of four or five people with whom I go for a walk so even if I don&amp;#39;t go for a day they&amp;#39;ll call me and said what happened we missed you so that peer pressure will keep you going regularly for your walk you have to give an excuse why you did not go if you don&amp;#39;t do that if you&amp;#39;re doing it by yourself one day you will stop and then you&amp;#39;ll say tomorrow should I go or should I not go remember the 21-day rule if you do an activity for 21 days continuously it&amp;#39;ll become a habit for you any habit good or bad habit it&amp;#39;ll it&amp;#39;ll happen that way suppose you&amp;#39;re not a person who drinks coffee okay and today at 11:00 in the morning I felt let me have a coffee next day I&amp;#39;ll feel should I have that coffee or not next day also I have a coffee then the third day it&amp;#39;ll become very strong at 11:00 you have to have that coffee after 21 days it&amp;#39;ll be impossible for me to function without that coffee if 11:00 I don&amp;#39;t get that coffee I&amp;#39;ll get headache I&amp;#39;ve got addicted to coffee not it&amp;#39;s not a bad thing I&amp;#39;m just telling you that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s how it works similarly good things also if you&amp;#39;re going regularly for a walk you&amp;#39;ll feel guilty if you don&amp;#39;t go for a walk for 21 days you have done it thereafter you won&amp;#39;t feel like breaking suppose 21 days you don&amp;#39;t go for a walk something happened some holidays came marriage came something and you broke it it&amp;#39;s very difficult to go back because your body will be one half of the brain tell you why should you go for the walk sleep for some more time that&amp;#39;s good doctor said sleep is also important yes I said sleep SLE is important but I didn&amp;#39;t tell you that exercise is not important so balancing everything is very important early to bed and early to rise makes you healthy wealthy and wise and remember always the far principle which I always keep talking about the F A these are the three components of exercise what is this f a f is for flexibility so you must be able to do exercises for your neck for your shoulder shoulder for your knees you must be able to turn so that you suddenly don&amp;#39;t get some uh dis prolapse or some muscle tear or some Sprain and so on so that is flexibility which is very very important upper limbs lower limbs you have to do that a is aerobics I&amp;#39;ve been talking about that all along about walking jogging swimming and so on and R is resistance training your muscles need to be toned up and that is what you do when you do resistance training both for the Upper Limb as well as for the lower limb you can do this resistance training so remember the far principle so in summary I would like to say that physical activity which we otherwise call as exercise is one of the most important things for a human being many people tell me it&amp;#39;s all right for you to say doctor you don&amp;#39;t know how busy I am you&amp;#39;re talking about half an hour 1 hour for me to find 15 20 minutes itself for exercise is very difficult well we have a solution for that also HIIT which stands for high intensity interval training and there is a video which will teach you all about HIIT and we have recently come up with a dance form called as tand now this was perfected by my daughter Dr anjana Dr anjini Harish and our team at the Dr mun diabetes special Health Center and The Madras Diabetes Research Foundation and I&amp;#39;ll play a small video for you to see of an active enjoyable dance performance you can get all the exercise that you need for the whole day [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] so thank you I hope you enjoyed watching this video we&amp;#39;ll be talking more about other lifestyle related factors including diet sleep and so on in subsequent videos [Music] [Applause]",

    "transcript": "[Music] in Singapore one and three are at risk of getting diabetes in their lifetime why is the figure so dismal I want to know how to tell if we are at risk and just how much this disease is costing all of us I am told I&amp;#39;ll be meeting a person who has been suffering with diabetes for a long long time I didn&amp;#39;t expect him to be this young and I&amp;#39;m in for a bigger surprise I was first diagnosed with diabetes when I was 14 years old at that point of time I was actually a bit shocked do you know how you got diagnosed with diabetes I was actually sick for a few weeks very largic lost in weight very thirsty so my mom bring me to to see my family doctor yeah after that uh my doctor suspected me that I have this symptoms so he did a glucose test what kind of treatment plan did the doctor put you on I was given oral medication but I did not really follow the instruction of the doctor so you didn&amp;#39;t take a medication no sometime I forgotten sometime I just miss miss out and then my because of my ECA I reach home late and then sometime I don&amp;#39;t bring my medication to school so you were not able to control the diabetes yep I still continue drinking my soft drinks my fatty foods how much soft drinks and how much fatty foods did you eat W uh many a lot of cans of cook yeah coca how many cans would you be able to drink a day maybe half a dozen oh are you serious yes at one go I can even challenge myself drinking 1.5 L at one go asell why then that just for the trail without thinking of consequences and you head or already been diagnosed with yes when did you realize that your condition was out of your control when I was serving national service I felt very sick I had food poisoning and then uh I went to the&amp;amp; to sick treatment the told me my sugar was actually quite high they actually wanted me to go and see the diabetes specialist back then so uh what the doctor gave me was oral medication and insulin what exactly is happening in guang&amp;#39;s body that requires medication and injections well imagine you are taking this airlane from Singapore to Bangkok you have to maintain a consistent altitude the whole way food raises blood sugar or in this case your altitude insulin lowers it non-diabetics aren&amp;#39;t concerned with altitudes as they have a working pancreas which produces insulin correctly this is akin to being on autopilot mode you can cruise with no problems Guang on the other hand has to constantly worry about his altitude staying at a consistently high altitude that is high blood sugar levels could lead to a diabetic coma while at a low altitude that is low blood sugar level a potential side effect of diabetes medications can sta the brain of glucose leading to blood Vision slurred speech and even seizures so for the first time for the your national service you had to inject yourself with insulin yes how did that feel it&amp;#39;s rather difficult because it&amp;#39;s like you are inserting a needle into yourself you can feel the pain of the needle needle PRI so sometime you have a rejection of oh I don&amp;#39;t want to take anymore yeah because it hurts did you stop injecting yourself as well yes I stopped using all the medication because of financial difficulties the medication was actually quite expensive back then uh insulin and syringes was actually quite uh it&amp;#39;s a bit hard for me to to pay all all these things were you aware of the consequences of not taking those types of medication at that point of time no because I was still very young I still quite strong so I still continue with my uh sugary diets until about 10 10 to 12 years ago that I have a very bad uh wound infection and my left sh that is actually been infected it started from very small small pimple and then he started to grow uh very red and then uh abset were coming out and then my whole leg were actually very swollen that I couldn&amp;#39;t even wear my shoes and then I&amp;#39;m was having fever War meting and then I was feeling very terrible I went back to see my diabetes doctor so uh she suspected that I may have a very early stage of kidney failure it is estimated that by 2050 there will be 1 million diabetics in Singapore which is why in 2016 this happened I&amp;#39;m declaring on Diabetes a national crisis call by the then Health Minister over the next few years we got people moving we put mandatory nutrition labeling of sugary drinks and we even try to get our Hawkers to make their dishes [Music] healthier all these efforts seem to have paid off the recent national population Health survey showed that theice prevalence of diabetes among singaporeans was 8.5% in 2022 this is a slight dip of 0.3 percentage points compared to 2017 when the war on the disease had just started but before you think we are out of the woods well I think you must uh look at this war diabetes as a very long game this is Professor CH he and his team brought Singapore&amp;#39;s diabetes crisis to widespread attention in 2016 we shouldn&amp;#39;t be just uh looking at indicators of um the prevalence of diabetes along the way um the target is that uh we do not want to have 1 million diabetics by 2050 and so we need to focus on actually the risk factors for diabetes in particular obesity the problem is that aging is a risk factor but obesity is also a risk factor for diabetes and in particular um obesity among the young and what we have seen is that obesity among the young you know those 30 years and Below have been increasing quite rapidly in recent years in terms of our control of obesity the population hasn&amp;#39;t come to a stage whereby they derive an internal motivation so you need to have people with a value system where they want to Value Health just as much as wealth so with the survey results 60% of people who have been diagnosed with diabetes are not controlling it well tell me what does it mean to control well your diabetes yeah so in terms of control for diabetes is essentially that I need to make sure that your blood sugar level do not fluctuate much and should not be very high so 60% is quite a lot why is it that they are not controlling their diabetes one of the big reason is it&amp;#39;s such a silent condition right I may be a diabetic and I don&amp;#39;t feel unwell so it it kind of forces or creates a certain sense of complacency because I don&amp;#39;t feel sick but it is at that silent phase that it actually continues to damage our blood vessels which in turn leads to all the long-term complications so I think it&amp;#39;s crucial that um not only patients must be educated to say that hey you must make sure you&amp;#39;re compliant so forth I think at a systems level we must put in place a way whereby we can actually ensure that large proportion of the diabetics are managed well and there are still 20% of the population out who are diabetics who do not know that they are diabetics right so if I have half a million diabetics in my cluster that means I have 100,000 th000 that I do not know that well when you put it that way it sounds like a lot it is a lot it is a lot early detection via screenings is important and yet well I don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s a really pressing issue why not do a diabetes screening I think it&amp;#39;s never occurred to me what happens when talking point helps diabetes Singapore to get young singaporeans [Music] screamed [Music] link Guang was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes when he was just 14 years old he is part of a very small number of singaporeans who are diagnosed with the disease when they were just teenagers usually I would have my males in the haer center so uh will you like to join me absolutely yeah before that I I need to take my insulin first okay this is my insulin pan it&amp;#39;s uh 6 mm oh I can see it it has a bit of luican on the needle so when you inject it it won&amp;#39;t be so pain so I&amp;#39;m now going to adjust my dosage which is 8 units and then my alcohol swap Guang has a shot of insulin before every meal to help control his blood sugar levels since his body can&amp;#39;t do that on its own [Music] okay then sanitize [Music] again so my meal time usually I would choose mixed vegetable rice because have more choices so I can choose those that is suitable for me brother uh thank you thank you Corner before I eat I need to take my medication first oh okay you still got some more yeah quite a lot rep Shake [Music] okay why do you not put yourself at home because I&amp;#39;m working and during my off dialysis days I reach home I really very tired really and then because of the post dialysis restlessness it will make me need to get more rest and then for my regular 135 my dialis days it will usually until 11:00 then I reach home so I don&amp;#39;t have the time to cook myself so the easiest way is to buy out there are different types of diabetes but the two big ones are type one which is an autoimmune disease we still don&amp;#39;t know what exactly causes it and type two which Guang has it has multiple risk factors including being overweight and family history type 2 diabetes accounts for 90% of all diabetes cases diabetes Singapore is the only local registered charity that is dedicated to fighting diabetes they organize free screenings across Singapore about twice a month it so happens that they are holding a free screening this weekend so I put out a call to action inviting our talking point viewers to come down do you frequently consume sugary drinks and fatty foods and think oh well I&amp;#39;m still young how could it really impact my health here&amp;#39;s your chance to find out over 50 singaporeans respond to to our call out we&amp;#39;ve set up here at the marry Mount Community Club with different areas for different tests but before we begin I want to find out what exactly screening entails what are the different tests that you conduct to screen for diabetes we do quite a range of uh test we do a hba1c so hba1c is basically a 3 month average of the blood glucose so and that result basically give us a very good indicative whether there&amp;#39;s a pre-diabetes or diabetes so that when we refer them back there&amp;#39;s a after the screening the doctor will know what to follow up without aggressive intervention one in four Singapore residents will have pre-diabetes by 2030 being pre-diabetic puts a person at increased risk of type 2 diabetes what is the biggest challenge in screening for diabetes I think the biggest challenge we have is reaching out to the community we don&amp;#39;t get much young adults coming for screening I think diabetes is more of like okay we have a lot of sugar right I think I do take a lot of sugar but I don&amp;#39;t think I take enough sugar to be like I will get diabetes that kind of thing well I don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s a really pressing issue but recently I&amp;#39;ve had a friend who just got diagnosed with diabetes so it&amp;#39;s been on my mind your friend is in 20 in his 20s yeah wow did that surprise you it was quite shocking actually I thought he was joking with me at first do you think diabetes will uh affect someone who is in the 20s or 30s I mean for sure but I think the chance of getting it is lower than being older like me but why why why uh I don&amp;#39;t before we get to their results I&amp;#39;m about to discover how costly diabetes IES really is to all of us if I don&amp;#39;t have diabetes and within my circle I don&amp;#39;t have anyone who&amp;#39;s suffering from diabetes why should I [Music] care Kavita venkataraman has spent the past 18 years publishing studies that exam examine the far-reaching consequences of diabetes if I don&amp;#39;t have diabetes and within my circle I don&amp;#39;t have anyone who&amp;#39;s suffering from diabetes why should I care even if diabetes does not affect you individually we are part of a larger society and there are serious costs to society from diabetes irrespective of whether it happens in your family or not costs of society we can think of it in two different ways one are the costs that are incurred in treating diabetes managing diabetes the other segment of cost are the indirect costs indirect costs in 2010 accounted for 58% of the total costs so the direct will be 42% if we looked at the cost of diabetes in total this would be about $1 billion in in 2010 by 2025 this number is going to look like this we are going to see a cost of 2.5 billion from diabetes by 2050 if the current trends [Music] assist so somebody has got to pay for all these treatments for the subsidies and to build infrastructure who is going to pay for this there will be tradeoffs so if the cost cost of care from diabetes and other chronic diseases is rising then we have either the choice of providing the same quality of care to this larger number to meet this increasing demand and then find some way to raise those those monies either through taxation it will be we as a society as taxpayers who will end up paying this cost so there is no getting away from the fact that the cost is going to be to each of us as part of the society and this nation or to then accept that we cannot provide the quality of care that we currently provide to Future generations with diabetes over the course of 20 years Guang has had to deal with various complications as a result of his diabetes from Progressive vision loss to foot surgery to kidney failure well today I&amp;#39;m in yishun again to catch up with Guang and he&amp;#39;s asked me to meet him here where he under goes dialysis so this is my so-call second home okay now I have to take my pre-dialysis with Okay can tell me about the financial cause of managing your disease how much subsidy do you get for my dialysis after deduction of my medic safe and Med Shield the remaining I will have to actually pay $50 co-pay from my Med safe at the end of the month I do not have to co-pay any cash consultation will be from my Med safe as well how sustainable are these sources I have to keep on working so that um my employer and myself have to uh contribute cpf and then the man is safe that&amp;#39;s right you can&amp;#39;t stop working basically I can&amp;#39;t stop working how does that make you doesn&amp;#39;t feel really that good because I can&amp;#39;t show up the work sometimes and then work power up and then the work responsibility on me becomes my colleagues responsibility as well so it&amp;#39;s a bit unfair for them yeah do you fear losing a job some I do yeah if I were to lose my job right now I had to get the top up for my Med safe and cpf and then there&amp;#39;s no source of income and then it&amp;#39;s hard for me to be being employed yeah because as a dialysis patient a lot of employers doesn&amp;#39;t like to hire those chronic disease patients yeah so it&amp;#39;s a bit difficult if you recall a week ago we got 53 talking point viewers screened for diabetes I&amp;#39;ve got the results of the DI diabetes screening tests the good news most are cleared uh one person though could be diabetic and at least six of them had results indicating that they could be pre-diabetic now what this means is that they have blood sugar levels that are higher than normal but not high enough to be diagnosed as type 2 diabetes all seven of them are below the age of 40 now I managed to speak to the viewer who could be diabetic understandably he was a little bit shocked but took it as a reality check so he will make a follow-up appointment to see his doctor these results rarely underscore the importance of getting screened because you might be at risk especially if you are overweight or have a family history of diabetes next week I witness for myself The Fallout that comes if we let diabetes spin out of control two out of three patients who are on dialysis here they are actually diabetic and reveal a shocking but little talked about outcome of poor diabetes Management in Singapore 1,500 amputations in one year that&amp;#39;s crazy wow that&amp;#39;s a [Music] lot [Music]",

    "transcript": "moving from the heart over to the pancreas now hippocrates the father of medicine 400 years bc no mention of diabetes in his writings so diabetes is a fairly modern disease diabetes is a lifestyle disease newton&amp;#39;s third law of motion states that to every action there&amp;#39;s an equal and an opposite reaction why isn&amp;#39;t the pancreas working that&amp;#39;s what we should be asking as proverbs 26 verse 2 states the curse causeless shall not come there is a reason there is a reason why pancreases are not working now the pancreases one of its main roles is to release two hormones one is insulin that gets the blood sugar down the other hormone is glucagon and that gets the blood sugar level up now the meal that you had tonight because it&amp;#39;s high in fiber i think everything had fiber generous proteins there&amp;#39;s your legumes and some great fats it gives a slow shore steady release of glucose of nutrients and that allows the pancreas to just release the insulin as it&amp;#39;s needed that&amp;#39;s what every cell in the body wants and that&amp;#39;s what our pancreas wants but what&amp;#39;s happening today is people predominantly are eating a high carbohydrate diet and this high carbohydrate diet releases a lot of glucose and that glucose when it gets into the blood especially the refined sugar and by the way the refined grains it&amp;#39;s almost as high as sugar but there was one grain that gets the blood sugar levels higher than refined sugar is that a surprise and the grain that does that is what bread and cereal and pasta and cakes etc and pizza are all made out of predominantly one grain what&amp;#39;s that one grain it&amp;#39;s wheat now in the 1950s wheat went through intensive cross-breeding and the reason they put it through intensive cross breeding is they wanted to create a plant with a high yield of grain so that that would help with the starvation crisis in africa in mexico in india and eventually dr norman bulag got a nobel prize for his hybridized wheat at first the stalk broke before the grain was fully ripe because wheat used to grow that high do you remember that we had a 25 year old wheat farmer come to our retreat he&amp;#39;d never heard of such a thing he didn&amp;#39;t know that wheat used to grow that high and so they went back to the drawing board and they came up with a wheat that only grows this high i was in holland well probably a month ago now and we&amp;#39;re driving along you know it&amp;#39;s very very flat and i saw big feels of sandy colored grass i said what is it it&amp;#39;s everywhere they said it&amp;#39;s wheat was only that high so it had only to be that high with a thick stem because some wheats are producing eight to ten times the grain that they originally that they originally produced so in the 1970s the wheat started to go worldwide so by the 1990s every bread cereal pasta cake etc pizza all made out of this hybridized wheat it was rushed through with no safety studies they didn&amp;#39;t think they had to do safety studies on wheat it was rushed through with no safety studies it sounds like the covert vaccine doesn&amp;#39;t it rushed through with no safety studies and who&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s experimented on i&amp;#39;m not interested in being experimented on i&amp;#39;m interested in experimenting whether exercise works i&amp;#39;m interested in experimenting whether drinking more water works or going to bed earlier works because if it doesn&amp;#39;t work i&amp;#39;ve lost nothing they&amp;#39;re the only things i&amp;#39;m interested in experimenting on but i&amp;#39;ve found that they work but what what it produced and they&amp;#39;re starting to realize this only now what it produced was a type of such starch structure that gets the blood sugar level up higher than even sugar so the starch structure that was created is called amylopectin a an amylopectin a is the name of the starch that was produced so let&amp;#39;s look at what it does we&amp;#39;ll do it up here it gets the blood sugar level up very high very fast so then you get a corresponding dump so that&amp;#39;s the a so let me give you something to compare it to aminopectin b amylopectin b is found in bananas and potatoes and if you&amp;#39;re familiar with the glycemic index of food bananas and potatoes they&amp;#39;re high on the glycemic index so they get the blood sugar level up relatively high relatively fast not as high and not as fast so it&amp;#39;s more like that so that&amp;#39;s your b amylopectin c is found in all your beans there&amp;#39;s your lentils chickpeas lima beans cannelloni beans kidney beans so what does the seed do the seed gives a lovely steady rise maintenance lovely steady drop that&amp;#39;s what every cell in the body wants so let&amp;#39;s have a look at it on the glycemic index now the glycemic index is a very important index for diabetics because the glycemic index is an index or a reading on how quickly the glucose in that food is released into the blood so your baseline is 55. so ch on your berries all new berries sit at about 26 grapefruit it sits at uh 25 so for the diabetic these these are good fruits because they&amp;#39;re low gi they&amp;#39;re a lovely slower delivery of fuel whereas bananas they sit up here somewhere so where does sugar sit sugar sits at 59. where does um white white bread white pasta white cereal it sits at 69 because of the amylopectin starch in it what about whole wheat whole wheat whole wheat bread whole wheat cereal it sits at 72. how could that be well because the whole wheat isn&amp;#39;t refined it&amp;#39;s got more amylopectin a in it and it&amp;#39;s the amylopectin a that gets the blood sugar level up now absolutely whole wheat bread is superior to white because it&amp;#39;s got fiber it&amp;#39;s got your b vitamins but in regard to the diabetic who&amp;#39;s watching their blood glucose levels they need to eliminate wheat totally i had one lady start to cry when she saw this i said why are you crying she said i&amp;#39;m a diabetic i&amp;#39;m type 2 diabetic she said i was diagnosed two years ago i do everything they tell me i eat wholemeal bread wholemeal pasta wholemeal cereal and she said in every six months i go to the doctor and he puts me on more insulin she said i&amp;#39;m not like the lady down the road she just eats cakes and candies and but i don&amp;#39;t do that she said i&amp;#39;m crying because i&amp;#39;ve been so frustrated but i have not known what to do so why aren&amp;#39;t the nutritionists told this how much wheat does america grow acres of it how much week does australia grow a lot so it&amp;#39;s big industry so it&amp;#39;s not an easy thing to change and the farmers love the hybridized wheat they&amp;#39;ve got to pay their bills 10 times more grain per acre that&amp;#39;s 10 times more dollars per acre so you see the problem so no wonder diabetes has skyrocketed it&amp;#39;s not just the sugar it&amp;#39;s also the wheat so to conquer diabetes what do we do to conquer diabetes go for the low glycemic index foods it&amp;#39;s not easy i mean it&amp;#39;s not it&amp;#39;s easy i meant to say it&amp;#39;s not hard to get a glycemic index you can you can google that it&amp;#39;s a matter of having uh berries for breakfast instead of banana it&amp;#39;s a it&amp;#39;s as simple as having a sweet potato instead of potato having your whole grains eliminating the wheat low gi foods number two daily legumes i met a man he was a scientist he was 69. he came to our retreat he said when i was 42 i was told i had pre-diabetes and to eat legumes every day you said i eat legumes every day and i never got diabetes because the beans give that lovely sure steady delivery of fuel but how do we stop them causing bloating or wind you soak them overnight and then you rinse them very well and then you bring them to the boil have you seen all the froth that comes on you know what that is wind you got to rinse it away what i do is when my beans are three quarters cooked i rinse them again and then i put my beans into a delicious sauce and then you will not have that problem they&amp;#39;ll be a lot easier to digest when i first married my husband 24 years ago he could handle lima beans he could handle red lentils he could not handle brown lentils and he could not handle uh kidney beans so what i did is at the meal i&amp;#39;d give him a teaspoon that didn&amp;#39;t cause a problem a few days later two teaspoons within a couple of weeks three teaspoons he can now handle them all so sometimes if there are some you can&amp;#39;t handle and they&amp;#39;re even well soaked and rinsed just start slowly and introduce yourself to them as we looked at when we looked at the liver the legumes are only a third the carbohydrate that you will find in your grains number three there are some things that must stop what must stop is wheat what must stop is refined sugar now if someone&amp;#39;s if someone&amp;#39;s looking at conquering diabetes initially they also need to eliminate all your healthy sugars like your your palm sugar your uh maple syrup and honey so they need to be stopped until the blood until the pancreas is starting to to recover and it can recover one young man named dan did our program he was type 1 diabetes he got diabetes after a strong course of antibiotics at the age of 15. he&amp;#39;s now 19. he said my my specialist said my pancreas is dead i said is it gangrene what&amp;#39;s dead i said if there is blood going through your pancreas it&amp;#39;s not dead the life of the flesh is in the blood so he began to do this another thing is no no wheat no caffeine and no no refined sugar and no caffeine caffeine can actually get an insulin response so that has to be stopped when he came to our retreat he ate only low glycemic foods he had legumes every meal he started to drink more water hydration and what he found was if he felt that he was getting a blood sugar levolo between meals he&amp;#39;d have a little bit of the salt and a glass of water and it would maintain him i do not advise diabetics eat every two hours because that really disrupts digestion when we looked at the journey through the gut did you notice that digestion averages three and a half to four hours so you&amp;#39;ve got to leave that break between meals if you eat food and this is what dan did and we just looked at this high fiber remember what fiber does it slowly releases the glucose generous proteins there&amp;#39;s your legumes nuts and seeds they&amp;#39;re all low carbohydrates so you&amp;#39;re not overworking the pancreas and also the healthy fats we also looked earlier in the week at fats that heal the fats that kill and the killer fats are your altered fats there&amp;#39;s your deep fried foods there&amp;#39;s your margarines those fats that have been changed or altered or your polyunsaturated fats that have been extracted using high heat they&amp;#39;re the dangerous fats these are the three foods that keep the food in the stomach longer these are the ones that give that steady consistent delivery of fuel also what dan did is he began to exercise and the exercise he implemented was the high intensity interval training so he&amp;#39;d put his joggers on every morning and he would run up and down the hills now after he was with us for four weeks he did two weeks program and two weeks in the garden and he came to me at the end of the third week and he said i want to tell you something he said the first week if i got a blood sugar level low in the middle of the night i had some candies in my bag i&amp;#39;d just take a candy he said to get the blood sugar level up but he said i&amp;#39;ll get a terrible headache but it got my blood sugar level up he said the second week i was feeling a bit guilty that i shouldn&amp;#39;t be doing that so he said if i&amp;#39;ve got a blood sugar level low in the middle of the night i&amp;#39;d eat an apple it takes a long time to eat an apple in the middle of the night doesn&amp;#39;t it the third week he did something else he said the third week if he got a blood sugar level low he&amp;#39;d jump on the floor and do 30 push-ups so what&amp;#39;s he doing there do you remember in our last presentation looking at the heart about the stores that we have in the cell remember the 20-step pathway that gives us two units of energy there&amp;#39;s the eight-step pathway that gives us 36 and of course that&amp;#39;s the oxygen pathway but remember the little bunch of grapes the little glycogen stores already in your muscle cell so when dan did 30 push-ups it caused a release of these glycogen stores that gave him him energy got the blood sugar level up he said to me why didn&amp;#39;t anyone tell me about glycogen i believe glycogen is the diabetic&amp;#39;s best kept secret it&amp;#39;s already in there and if you run out of that what else have you got you&amp;#39;re fat that&amp;#39;s right he told me that one morning it got up i have to give you australian levels i don&amp;#39;t know if yours are similar i don&amp;#39;t think they are so the blood sugar level should sit at about anywhere between five and six so he got up one morning and his blood glucose levels were free so what he did was he had the salt water got dressed had another salt more water went for a run came back tested his blood glucose levels they were nine and he&amp;#39;d had nothing to eat where did that come from came from the stores the glycogen stores and the fat stores if you&amp;#39;re running out of glycogen it&amp;#39;s an amazing process that&amp;#39;s why exercise is vital not only that what happens when you exercise and you&amp;#39;re doing the high intensity yourself screaming out for fuel so what happens is extra insulin receptor sites develop on the membrane around the cell so that it can take more glucose that&amp;#39;s quite incredible isn&amp;#39;t it now before someone develops diabetes they usually start with insulin resistance you&amp;#39;ve heard of insulin resistance what happens with insulin resistance the person say on a high carbohydrate diet a lot of wheat blood glucose levels are going high pancreas gets screamed at you see high glucose demands high insulin so when blood glucose levels are high the pancreas is getting screamed out quick insulin more insulin so it releases a lot of insulin too much insulin actually so what happens now goes too low so down there the brain says to the pancreas stop the insulin release the glucagon but what does the person actually also do down there has a candy has a coke has a coffee with three tops cups of teaspoons of sugar what does that do whoa up it goes again now too high stop the glucagon release the insulin oh no stop the can you see what&amp;#39;s happening the pancreas is just wearing out i&amp;#39;m against child abuse i&amp;#39;m against animal abuse now i&amp;#39;m against pancreatic abuse but many that&amp;#39;d be like someone kicking and kicking their dog not realizing it&amp;#39;s hurting the dog but it&amp;#39;s actually not that clear because we can&amp;#39;t even see the pancreas we don&amp;#39;t know what&amp;#39;s going on in there and so many people don&amp;#39;t realize like this lady that started crying she didn&amp;#39;t know that they&amp;#39;d change the wheat she didn&amp;#39;t know that it created that that starch structure that gets it up even higher one lady said but we were always told whole wheeled breads really good bread can you get bread that or can you eat bread you can you can from the ancient grains i&amp;#39;m going to give you a website and this young man it&amp;#39;s his own business www.simpleness and he uses the ancient grains he&amp;#39;s in north carolina and he will shop or ship anywhere and that is excellent bread it&amp;#39;s probably more expensive than other bread you&amp;#39;ve brought but one slice of that bread is usually equal in nutritive value to a whole life of other breads you can get wheat that has not been hybridized there&amp;#39;s your spelt and your kamut and your incan horns there are grains they&amp;#39;re called ancient grains when my son was i think he was 14 he got a job he had to cycle five ma five kilometers to a little italian fruit and vegetable shop in australia we have little fruit and vegetable shops that&amp;#39;s all they sell so in all the little towns you&amp;#39;ll have a butcher shop you&amp;#39;ll have a baker shop you have a fruit and veggie shop and it was run by italian italian family there was mama mama was about late sixties there was daughter daughter was uh early forties and mama would say to peter peter get that broccoli put it out the front so peter had carried out the front and he&amp;#39;d meet daughter and the dog said peter what are you doing with that broccoli now get it back there and if peter tried to speak he&amp;#39;d got into trouble because he&amp;#39;s back answering so he turned around and then he&amp;#39;d meet mama peter what are you doing that broccoli i told you again better turn around and hopefully eventually they&amp;#39;d meet peter had come home every day and he&amp;#39;d have a backpack full of rock melons or things that they were going to thrown out he&amp;#39;d come he&amp;#39;d say mum i&amp;#39;ve got some good fruit today after about two weeks he said mum can i get another job it wasn&amp;#39;t the five kilometres cycling it wasn&amp;#39;t the backpack full of goodies and it was these women and isn&amp;#39;t that what what people are doing to their pancreas get it up no get it down no get it up no get it just wears them out and that&amp;#39;s when insulin resistance happens insulin resistance is when so much glucose is coming in that these insulin receptor sites basically say i&amp;#39;m sick of the side of you i don&amp;#39;t want to even see you anymore so what happens is the blood the blood glucose levels remain high because it can&amp;#39;t get into the cell because of insulin resistance and the brain sees all the glucose in the blood and start screaming at the pancreas more insulin more can you see what&amp;#39;s happening and the insulin just can&amp;#39;t can&amp;#39;t do it anymore so it stops sometimes something can damage the beta cells in the pancreas like dan when he had had the the the strong course of antibiotics it had damaged the the pancreatic cells so let me finish the story of dan so by the end of the third week dan&amp;#39;s insulin has gone from 90 units a day down to 10 units a day type one diabetic three weeks why was he getting blood sugar level lows in the middle of the night he was on too much insulin i always leave it with the person because they take their blood sugar and adjust it accordingly what had his specialist told him his pancreas was dead well the fact that he kept getting blood sugar level lows meant that his pancreas was starting to work and now he&amp;#39;s on too much insulin so he backed off he backed off until after three weeks he was only taking 10 units a day that&amp;#39;s quite incredible he was diligent he didn&amp;#39;t want to even eat fruit he said i want to conquer this thing he&amp;#39;s only 19. he went home a very happy young man but i want to tell you about bobby bobby&amp;#39;s story is remarkable he&amp;#39;s also a type 1 diabetic and he came to the retreat when we&amp;#39;re in alabama and he came was probably five years ago now and he ke 62 they wheeled him in in a wheelchair they&amp;#39;d recently taken the lymph nodes out of his groin to try and determine why he had diabetes i don&amp;#39;t quite understand that but when he flew to us from florida being up in the plane his legs had swollen because his lymph nodes were gone that&amp;#39;s why he was in a wheelchair he&amp;#39;s not usually in a wheelchair he said i&amp;#39;ve just he said the doctors have told me last month they can do no more for me he was on medication he was on 90 units of insulin a day that&amp;#39;s short and long acting he was on blood pressure blood cholesterol blood thinning he said i will not be able to exercise with the other guests look at my legs i said that&amp;#39;s right but i said i what i want you to do is every hour i want you to get on the trampoline or the little mini rebounder and just go like this because that fluid is lymphatic fluid and when you are on the rebound it directly stimulates your lymphatic system i said every hour just one one minute like that that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s all you need to do and i want you to walk barefoot on the grass to massage those feet i said i don&amp;#39;t want you to go on the walks with the other guests that you know the legs within 24 hours the legs had come down by half he did the two days on juicing blood glucose levels were starting to come down at the end of two weeks now he was diligent in this to the point where he&amp;#39;d sit next to me and say am i right have i got the right amount of fruit on this plate he said to me anything you told me to do i will do so at the end of two weeks he was down to 10 units of insulin a day that&amp;#39;s from 90 units of insulin type 1 diabetic implementing this he emailed me three months later off all medication everything and he said and i&amp;#39;ve i&amp;#39;ve lost a lot of weight i&amp;#39;m trying to think of it i think it was about 40 pound that he&amp;#39;d lost in those three months when he got home his 42 year old wife said this is your baby i&amp;#39;m not interested i like my champagne croissants and coffee he said okay now after three months she&amp;#39;s looking at her husband he&amp;#39;s lost all his weight he&amp;#39;s looking good he&amp;#39;s feeling fantastic he&amp;#39;s not the grumpy husband he used to be see when blood sugar levels drop down that&amp;#39;s when diabetics feel bad feel impatient his blood glucose levels were steady i said tell me what you&amp;#39;re doing told me your exercise he said i i cycle six miles a day i swim 30 laps a day and i rebound three times a day what are you prepared to put into this this man was prepared to put this into it and the results were incredible remember what his doctors had just told him they basically sent him home to die saying we can do no ma no more for you he was a wealthy man and he had the best specialist he told me that he&amp;#39;d spent a million dollars on his health in the last 10 years and he met a little lady at the swoon pill one day and they got talking and she said i think i know someone that can help you and he came to our retreat anyway the next email i got he said my wife&amp;#39;s interested she stopped her coffee she stopped her croissants and she&amp;#39;s so happy because she has lost 15 pound and she&amp;#39;s been wanting to lose weight why was she interested her husband didn&amp;#39;t beat her over the head with everything she just watched she just watched in fact you know what they did after six months they were remarried he said i just feel like my wife&amp;#39;s got a new man and she said i have and so they re dedicated their life to each other just an incredible story every single case is different because there can be different factors that come together in every case and i think bobby&amp;#39;s case is very interesting because his case would be considered quite extreme type 2 diabetic is a lot easier to conquer because the beta cells aren&amp;#39;t as damaged as usually in type 1 diabetic so we have many type 2 diabetic stories who who have totally conquered it but i like dan&amp;#39;s story and bobby&amp;#39;s story because they were type 1 and they were told that they would never conquer their diabetes but they certainly did so as you can see we&amp;#39;re actually getting close to those eight laws again aren&amp;#39;t we and i believe that it&amp;#39;s very important every day to thank god for your pancreas to thank god that he&amp;#39;s given us a body that has the ability to heal itself and if you don&amp;#39;t heal in three months thank god and if you don&amp;#39;t heal in eight months thank god because you&amp;#39;re getting there the bible says in first thessalonians 5 18 in everything give thanks for this is the will of god in christ jesus concerning you and then further down in that same chapter and this is verse 21 it says prove all things and hold fast to that which is good prove it try it for yourself that&amp;#39;s why i believe everybody should they should be their own doctor because only you know how you feel only you know what you&amp;#39;ve been through and only you know how your body responds and reacts to to what&amp;#39;s happening and that&amp;#39;s why the best doctor will do this to you is that right so don&amp;#39;t be the doctor that won&amp;#39;t listen when your body speaks listen so our guests that have remarkable responses regarding diabetes we feed them two meals a day and what are most diabetics told to eat every two hours well often the body doesn&amp;#39;t know the difference between thirst and hunger it&amp;#39;s often first and also when you have that little bit of salt and that glass of water and remember at least eight glasses a day it&amp;#39;s a lot harder to drink it in cold weather so just sip it i always have my bottle by me i just sip sip sip and it&amp;#39;s amazing how much you can drink when you&amp;#39;re sipping away are there any questions before we close yes stevia is probably the one sweetener that doesn&amp;#39;t get an insulin response some people say i don&amp;#39;t like stevia and i say well you&amp;#39;ve used too much because if you overdo stevia it gets a bitter aftertaste so go a little less it&amp;#39;s hard to believe that such a small amount can sweeten so start very very slow so that is one sweetener that that can be used but what you&amp;#39;re better to do is veer away from the sweets at all i find that when people stop this high carbohydrate diet they say to me i don&amp;#39;t crave sweets anymore the more you sweet and the more weight and the more sugar you eat the more you will crave so in place of the um wheat what about sprouted barley breads um yeah you could do this i find the sprouted breads very heavy myself and i like bread to be light and sweet but i do know that some people love it and they cut it very thin and it&amp;#39;s can be eaten that way some people go to more crackers you know rye crackers things like that we&amp;#39;ve answered every question that&amp;#39;s great here&amp;#39;s one yeah oh we might take one up there yeah is there a good uh alternative i don&amp;#39;t use homeopath homeopathy but the uh hawthorne berry we&amp;#39;ve seen many people get off their blood pressure medication by taking the hawthorne berry and you can take four to five thousand milligrams a day and you can use the hawthorne berry even when a person&amp;#39;s still on blood pressure meds but as the blood pressure comes down then you because you&amp;#39;ve implemented all the lifestyle changes then you can start reducing the blood pressure medication yes can you explain the salt water thing again somehow i didn&amp;#39;t catch that okay ah there we lose a lot of salt every day and we need to take salt and sea water is 92 minerals but the salt you buy in the supermarket shelf is only two minerals so it causes an imbalance in and out of the cell which gets the pressure up so we need to take mineral salt which is your celtic salt or the the himalayan salt he actually didn&amp;#39;t drink salt water he took a little bit of the salt and then he drank he drank the water that&amp;#39;s how you do it so i was i read a book and it said to do a half a teaspoon of the celtic salt in 10 cups of water half a teaspoon of celtic salt sounds a bit extreme i think it was the water cure okay the water cure and i&amp;#39;ve been doing that for a long time you&amp;#39;ve been doing it have you okay how often a day do you do that twice all right that sounds like a lot oh i guess you watch what your body does with it yes well the wheat&amp;#39;s the only grain that has been genetically modified uh some rices have that&amp;#39;s why it&amp;#39;s important to to buy organic grains unfortunately if you buy organic wheat it is it it has been grown organically but it still uh has been through the hybridization process so great alternatives is your ancient grains but also your buckwheat your millets your rice they&amp;#39;re good grains um i&amp;#39;ve heard garlic can regulate blood pressure is that true uh yes it can it can be a contributing factor especially if you&amp;#39;re doing everything else right but there&amp;#39;s a lot of research been done on garlic that is true okay thanks what about corn can you talk about corn corn unfortunately in the u.s most corn has been genetically modified so if you can get organic non-gmo corn uh corn is great um have you noticed in a lot of supermarkets they chop the top off the corn the very the very tip of it it&amp;#39;s usually because it&amp;#39;s gone moldy that&amp;#39;s the problem and if you ever bought corn and you see some of the little kernels at the top of pink that&amp;#39;s mold so one of the problems with corn and especially the dried corn that as it dries all the silk goes black well that&amp;#39;s mold and every silk is connected to every kernel of corn and dr robert young in his book thick and tide he&amp;#39;s got a page and this all the moles that they found in corn so you know i i do love corn but please buy it fresh buy it non-gmo and and then it&amp;#39;s safe barbara could the use of jerusalem artichokes be used to help in a pinch to help control people with insulin issues uh they can but they would have to have everything else implemented so we have seen incredible results just by the lifestyle changes so jerusalem artichokes could play a role that&amp;#39;s true so when you say hybridized wheat is that gmo or is that something totally different it is different because they put the wheat through intensive cross breeding and this was in the 1950s so this was a little bit before the genetically modified foods took off so you can&amp;#39;t really find wheat now that&amp;#39;s not um hybridized yes you can it&amp;#39;s called enkenholm or spelt or kamut okay all the ancients the ancient grains okay all right what about rice or quinoa quinoa is very good uh rice rice&amp;#39;s rice is an excellent grain but it must be cooked fresh every day in 1921 japan passed the rice act putting stringent rules on the storage of cooked rice because all through asia there was an epidemic of cardiac beriberi which was a heart disease and they traced it to the mold on cooked rice so rice molds very easily and when you see the mold the mold has already been there it&amp;#39;s just to its reproductive stage so rice should be brown rice it should be very well cooked and it should be cooked fresh every day so once they implemented the rice act that put stringent rules you could not keep rice more than 24 hours had to be refrigerated cardiac berry berry stopped yes i was wondering about with commute or spelt can we make bread out of it with yeast and it does as well as regular whole wheat or yeah absolutely because it&amp;#39;s the original wheat anchon horn is the wheat that god made which was incan horn what is that it&amp;#39;s the original wheat you can i think it&amp;#39;s either incan horn yes i&amp;#39;ve also seen it written i corn and onion corn so there&amp;#39;s a few do we need to supplement vitamin d in the winter vitamin d stores very well in the body and [Music] compared to a hundred years ago people spend a lot more time indoors so originally people didn&amp;#39;t have to supplement because they spent so much time out of doors so if you get adequate sun you don&amp;#39;t need to supplement i&amp;#39;ve never taken vitamin d supplements but i&amp;#39;m a gardener so i&amp;#39;m outside a lot i do recognize that some people may need vitamin d supplements and there was a doctor who gave a presentation on covert that said that he found that all his people that got covered or these patients with covert had vitamin d deficiency so that makes it very attractive to have the vitamin d supplements so i do acknowledge in it may be necessary in some cases i was wondering if uh cooked grains are better for you than the raw cereals even if you&amp;#39;re getting the kamut and those type of grains in your cereal is it better to eat the cooked grains like the oats and the things like that yeah that&amp;#39;s a very good question i was talking to agatha thrash many years ago when she was still alive and she had read a statement by the the health author ellen white who stressed long slow cooking with grain so she did some experiments she would cook grain for so long and she&amp;#39;d put it under the microscope and if there were still starch granules they lit up like almost little lights and so she cooked many grains and she found that it was only the long slow cooking that broke down the starch granules so raw oats are totally indigestible so you are right grain should have long slow cooking that&amp;#39;s where your slow cookers are good to put them in slow cookers overnight wake up in the morning it&amp;#39;s cooked and ready ready to eat so grains definitely need long slow cooking to break down the starch granules she said that those starch granules are about six times the size of a red blood cell and a lot of postmortems that she did she found little blockages and scars in many of the fine capillaries and she believes it&amp;#39;s because people don&amp;#39;t cook their grains enough but when you have she tried popcorn all the starch granules were broken down waffles all the starch granules are broken down so in the browning process like of the waffle that that speeds up the breakdown of the starch granules i had a question about the diabetes i&amp;#39;ve heard of type 2 being reversed that&amp;#39;s not new to me but type one completely new this tonight so my brother got it when he was 21 so he&amp;#39;s had it 15 years is that to say that if he went on this program he would have a high chance of reversing it sorry i didn&amp;#39;t get all that um i think it&amp;#39;s your accent i&amp;#39;m used to ozzy okay my brother has had type 1 diabetes for about 15 years he is 36. so my question was is this program would this work for him even though it&amp;#39;s been that long of a time since he&amp;#39;s had it i don&amp;#39;t see why not and it&amp;#39;s worth a try you&amp;#39;ve got nothing to lose yeah okay we might make this the last question back to the grains again and breaking down the starches would dexterizing the grease dextronising helps and that&amp;#39;s why the browning process speeds it up so what i sometimes do is i dextronize rice in a dry pan lightly toasted and that that that certainly can cut down the reduce the cooking time so when you cook rice in a rice cooker what you should do so i think it cooks in about 20 minutes or half an hour she found that the starch granules weren&amp;#39;t fully broken down so what you do you cook your rice but just to leave the lid on for another hour because if you boil rice for an out it&amp;#39;s not very nice so you boil it until all the water&amp;#39;s gone and then you just leave it there and that&amp;#39;ll be like a little oven and it will continue to cook for about another hour and she found that that broke the starch granules down okay we&amp;#39;ll pass over to our introducer and she&amp;#39;ll tell you all about you tomorrow okay did you enjoy that very good maybe you have seen the holiday and the cooking with judy cooking classes the flyers for those are out there and also they were in the lunchroom so i hope that you&amp;#39;ve picked them up there&amp;#39;s also another seminar that has started online and there&amp;#39;s a flyer outside panorama of prophecy if you&amp;#39;re interested in that you can catch it online at amazingfacts.org and today as we entered into the sabbath we&amp;#39;re reminded that although throughout the week we&amp;#39;ve talked about physical health i think that every time in each presentation she has brought up that is god that does the healing right and so we reminded that we are made up of both physical as well as spiritual and it is our connection to god that really brings the healing and the health so as we are reminded of that today may we also remember to rest rest in him and rest physically and shall we bow our heads for a word of prayer as we think of that father in heaven we thank you so much for this sabbath that we have entered into where you remem remind us lord that you are our source of strength of health and of healing and i pray that you would help us during these sabbath hours to be healed of the sin that so easily besets us and that we may remember that jesus is our savior we thank you for these meetings and we ask that you help us to go with your blessing and to come back tomorrow morning at 9 30 to be able to uh learn more and also to draw closer to you for as i pray in jesus name amen so tomorrow morning first presentation is at 9 30. barbara will speak again at 11 o&amp;#39;clock and then we will have lunch and there&amp;#39;s an afternoon meeting as well brian do i have that correct for the evening the same time i don&amp;#39;t see brian he&amp;#39;s coordinated but um yeah i don&amp;#39;t see the okay

    "transcript": "hello my friends Dr kenberry here this video today is going to be just for people with diabetes or if you love someone with diabetes there&amp;#39;s so much confusion out there and there&amp;#39;s a new article that I want to share with you that adds to this confusion the confusion is what should my A1C be to be safe now we know from much research that the lower your A1C is the lower your risk of diabetes complications whether you&amp;#39;re type one or type two I found this article in the New York Times and you may not read the New York Times but even if you don&amp;#39;t 11 million people do every day and there&amp;#39;s a new article that I want to share with you and go over and and explain to you where this comes from and how you need to understand this why you can safely uh ignore this article so this is the article from the the New York Times why older people may not need to watch blood sugar so closely now if you watch this channel you know that I want you to watch your blood sugar very very closely because the better your blood sugar the better your A1C the lower your risk of diabetic complications nobody wants diabetic complications so why would they have this article written in the New York Times saying oh you probably shouldn&amp;#39;t watch your blood sugar so closely the subtitle intensive management of diabetes pays fewer dividends as patients age and raises the chances of hypoglycemia that&amp;#39;s low blood sugar but many people have not gotten the message this is uh written by paulpan who&amp;#39;s actually been a a journalist for the New York Times for years she&amp;#39;s written a couple of books and she also teaches a journalism class at Columbia I think she&amp;#39;s a very good um author and a very good uh reporter but she didn&amp;#39;t get the full story in this article so it it it starts with the watching a single person with diabetes Al Miss Ora Larson uh having a low blood sugar episode says she has several episodes like this each year seem to be coming more uh frequent uh and then it goes on to explain hypoglycemia occurs when levels of blood sugar or glucose fall too low a reading below 70 milligrams per Decor is an accepted definition accepted by whom if you follow this channel you know that I want your I don&amp;#39;t I don&amp;#39;t I I love it when your blood sugar is 70 uh if it gets below 60 then we&amp;#39;ll talk because of the we way that I teach you to manage your blood sugar which this article should have went into but definitely did not so it is true that hypoglycemia occurs more frequently at Advanced ages uh if you&amp;#39;ve been a diabetic for years you&amp;#39;ve probably had at least one episode of hypoglycemia it&amp;#39;s very scary it&amp;#39;s also very dangerous I agree with all that uh Miss larsson&amp;#39;s endocrinologist and her primary care doctor worry about her having low blood sugar episodes because it can increase your risk of Falls broken bones heart arhythmia and cognitive damage all true if you&amp;#39;re managing your diabetes a particular way not true if you&amp;#39;re managing it the proper way so both of them have advised her her endocrinologist and her her primary care doctor have advised her to let her A1C be above seven now if you follow this channel you&amp;#39;re like what why so this all started back with the Accord trial back in 2008 was when it was published they use very intensive medication therapy to tightly control diabetics blood sugar and A1C the main things they used were insulin and uh the Glide Glyburide uh to which work by so insulin works by actually inje ing insulin into your body the sulam neuras work by making by forcing your pancreas to produce more insulin and then they also used another drug extensively in that study which has since been pulled off the market so if you are managing your blood sugars and your A1C with aggressive pharmaceutical intervention then you have to worry about everything that&amp;#39;s talked about in this article but we&amp;#39;re moving past that now millions of people are using a low carb keto even a carnivore diet to completely control their type 1 diabetes or to completely reverse their type two diabetes and not even have to take any medication in that light hypoglycemia ceases to be a concern at all but this article written for 11 million people and you know there will be knockoff articles written in other um newspapers and magazines and websites because that&amp;#39;s how modern Journal journalism works one person writes a piece and everybody else copies it changes a few words uh and so this uh patient in this article is using Victoza uh and injects it uh three times a week and watches her diet so that literally is the only time the word diet is mentioned in this article there is zero mention of of a low carb diet there&amp;#39;s zero mention of a ketogenic diets now why why would I bring that up why does that even matter well it matters because when you ask chat GPT you can verify this yourself what&amp;#39;s the most studied diet for diabetes control and reversal it&amp;#39;s a low carb diet a very low carb ketogenic diet a keto diet it it has been studied more more randomized control trials than any other dietary intervention on the planet and more and more researches coming out every day showing that if you have type one diabetes you can have a normal A1C and normal blood sugars and inject very little insulin now when you inject very little insulin guess what you are at much lower risk of developing hypoglycemia if you&amp;#39;re a type two diabetic you can use a low carb diet a very low carb ketogenic diet a KET enic diet a ketovore diet or a carnivore diet to completely reverse your type 2 diabetes so you don&amp;#39;t have it anymore and you don&amp;#39;t have to take any medication at all for it thus obviating any fears of a hypoglycemic episode hypoglycemic episode in the face of diabetes occurs only when you use too much medication and then don&amp;#39;t need enough carbohydrates to match your insulin or the other medication that you&amp;#39;re using so so now back to this article uh you would have thought since obviously low carb Keo carnivore is the most popular dietary strategy on planet Earth right now how many Instagram channels and Tik Tok accounts and Facebook posts are there about low carb keto carnivore and reversing type 2 diabetes or thoroughly managing type 1 diabetes with minimal uh insulin use and some cases 80% less insulin so even this patient so say so the article says so when her doctors recommended a higher A1C she resisted she said I think it&amp;#39;s a bunch of hooy it didn&amp;#39;t make sense to me well it doesn&amp;#39;t make sense to me Madam I agree with you she got a lot of encouragement recognition from her Physicians for controlling her diabetes staying on top of it that&amp;#39;s because it&amp;#39;s uniformally a good thing to do now the whole one of the main points of this article is as you get older in your 70s and 80s and Beyond the risk of hypoglycemia from intensive pharmaceutical management outweighs the benefit of having a normal A1C or having a normal blood sugar and it in in that iteration I agree you shouldn&amp;#39;t use aggressive insulin and aggressive uh G GoRide and Glipizide and GoRide 100% agree with that you should not do that in people over the age of really 50 but we no longer even have to do that because we now know that larb keto carnivore diets the most studied dietary intervention for diabetes makes these drugs unnecessary but they&amp;#39;re not mentioned a single time in this article it goes on to say the American geriatric Society call for a hemoglobin A1c goal between 7.5 and eight you just so even if you&amp;#39;re 70 75 even 80 are you are you dead are you ready to lay down in the pine box most of you would say uh hell no I&amp;#39;m not dead I want to live if you&amp;#39;re I don&amp;#39;t care if you&amp;#39;re 80 if you&amp;#39;re running around with an A1C of 7.5 to8 your chances of Lo losing a toe losing a foot losing kidney functions going blind are 10x 10x what they would be if you are controlling your type 2 diabetes with a very low carbohydrate diet and no medication then you can safely get your A1C down under 5.7 thus putting your risk of diabetic complications back to the Baseline of what just average people in the population they they don&amp;#39;t have a huge risk of losing a foot or a leg of having to go on dialysis of going blind of having just a terrible skin infection that won&amp;#39;t heal even with antibiotics iotics you as somebody with diabetes you don&amp;#39;t have to suffer that either if you&amp;#39;ll just try a low carb a ketogenic diet a carnivore diet try one of those iterations of a very low carbohydrate diet you can wean down and stop your diabetes medications if you&amp;#39;re a type two diabetic if you&amp;#39;re a type 1 diabetic you can inject 50 60 70 80% less ins insulin have a much lower risk of develop in hypoglycemia and if you&amp;#39;re a type two you&amp;#39;re not going to ever develop hypoglycemia again for the rest of your life and you could literally add 10 years to your life now if you ask the average 80-year-old hey would you like to add 10 years to your life most of them are going to say uh yeah especially if their health span is keeping up with their lifespan so relaxing aggressive treatment can involve stopping a drug lowering a dose switching to another medication an approach called deintensification I would only recommend you do that if you&amp;#39;ve adopted a very low carbohydrate diet so then they talk about OIC of course they have to put that in you if big food and big Pharma were to get together and ask the New York Times hey I want you to write an article so that people will still eat lots of junk food and still use lots of pharmaceuticals uh we&amp;#39;re not going to talk about Keto at all but that&amp;#39;s the that&amp;#39;s the article and so we&amp;#39;re going to relax the A1C guidelines and you can eat whatever and just you you know it doesn&amp;#39;t matter if your blood sugar goes to 210 after you eat that&amp;#39;s no big deal this is the article even though I don&amp;#39;t think that this author intended that whatsoever she fell perfectly into the Trap that big food and big Pharma have been setting for decades to say ah it&amp;#39;s so you don&amp;#39;t need perfect blood sugar control you you know you want to take several pharmaceutical Med medications you want to eat just whatever eat the rainbow eat all things in moderation that&amp;#39;s what even though I don&amp;#39;t think that was her intention that&amp;#39;s exactly what this article um leads to people thinking so if if somebody who didn&amp;#39;t know what I know and what longtime viewers of this channel know if they read this article they&amp;#39;d be like huh so I can just have an A1C of you know 7.6 7.7 that&amp;#39;s totally fine I maybe can even stop a medication and and eat you know watch my diet that&amp;#39;s the quote from the article watch my diet uh with no no no um verb no words at all given to what diet should you eat just watch your diet what the hell does that even mean so this article is part of the reason that people think oh it&amp;#39;s fine to to have an A1 of of 7.2 7.7 it&amp;#39;s totally fine my doctor said it was fine there&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s you know the position statement from the geriatric Society the American Diabetes Association they all say this is fine what people need to understand is that all these associations take millions of dollars a year from both big food manufacturers and big Pharma manufacturers this is the reason so many people with diabetes are confused they get all these confusing messages they&amp;#39;ve been told for years by their doctors you want to have as low at A1C as possible which is absolutely true but then they&amp;#39;re also told oh eat you know Mediterranean eat plant-based um whole grains fruits and vegetables fruit juice smoothies you can never have a normal a SE eating those Foods drinking fruit juice smoothies you drinking fruit juice fresh squeezed fruit juice you can never have a normal A1C as a diabetic doing those things and so then they turn to the Pharmaceuticals and they get their a see down but if they&amp;#39;re too aggressive with their medications then they have low blood sugar episodes they fall and bump their head fall and break a hip fall and break a wrist or an ankle they fall and get a subdural hematoma they you know bad things happen if your blood sugar dips too low because you&amp;#39;re using Pharmaceuticals too aggressively so the solution for this author and all of the the billion dollar corporations that I don&amp;#39;t think had influence on her writing but effectively she&amp;#39;s riding right into their hand is ah don&amp;#39;t worry about it eat the rainbow keep your A1C 7.5 is that&amp;#39;s fine especially if you&amp;#39;re 65 70 7580 you don&amp;#39;t want to have too tight of blood pressure or blood sugar control this is provably false you don&amp;#39;t want to have too tight of a blood pressure control injecting insulin or using gide GoRide Glipizide abs absolutely true they&amp;#39;re going to cause you to have low blood sugar episodes you&amp;#39;ll fall and hurt yourself or you&amp;#39;ll wreck the car you sure don&amp;#39;t want to have the keys taken away from you what I implore you to do is to look into a low carbohydrate diet a very low carb ketogenic diet a ketogenic diet a ketovore diet or a carnivore diet so that you can reverse your type 2 diabetes and it&amp;#39;ll be gone forever and you can throw all the Pharmaceuticals in the garbage and never have to worry about a low blood sugar episode again if you&amp;#39;re type one adopt one of these very low carbohydrate diets and you will inject 50 60 70% less insulin you&amp;#39;ll have a much lower risk of having a hypoglycemic episode you&amp;#39;ll have a much more normal A1C and you will slash your risk of diabetic complications not sure why this author didn&amp;#39;t talk about the most researched dietary intervention for diabetes but she did not talk about it at all if the author happens to watch this I&amp;#39;m happy to do an interview with you as a board member of the American Diabetes Society I&amp;#39;m happy to do an interview with you not necessarily rebutting this but just talking about seniors over the age of of 5560 they need to adopt a very low carbohydrate diet that way they never have a low blood sugar episode they also never have any of the disastrous complications that come from having an A1C of 7 .5 they also never suffer from the potentially disastrous side effects of taking modern diabetes medications now I hope this video helped you a lot if you know somebody who suffers from diabetes please consider sharing this video with them and also if you need if you need group coaching and you need a tribe of people who can help you reverse your type 2 diabetes or who can help you achieve a normal a see and use 50 60 70% less insulin as a type 1 diabetic consider joining our community we&amp;#39;ve got hundreds of people in there who have reversed their type two diabetes and keeping it reversed we&amp;#39;ve got several people with type one diabetes in the group who have normal a1c&amp;#39;s and use way less insulin than they used to

Olive oil There is a big misconception that if you have\ntype 2 diabetes, you cannot have any fats in your diet. This is false because unsaturated fats are\nessential for a person with type 2 diabetes. Trans and saturated fats are the ones to stay\naway from because they can promote weight gain and increase heart disease risks. Extra virgin olive oil is known for being\none of the “good fats,” but it also contains other healthy nutrients important to the body. It is rich in monounsaturated fats, which\nstudies have shown can help lower “bad” LDL cholesterol levels. Extra virgin olive oil also contains antioxidants,\nwhich can help reduce oxidative stress in the body. This means that it can act as an anti-aging\nagent by fighting free radicals and reducing oxidative stress. It can also prevent cardiovascular disease\nand cancer. 2. Nuts &amp;amp; Seeds Frequent nut and seed consumption can reduce\nthe risk of developing type 2 diabetes. This is because they are high in fiber, protein,\nand healthy fats, which can help control blood sugar levels. Nuts and seeds, when eaten in moderation,\ncan protect people with diabetes from developing serious complications. However, it is important to note that people\nwith diabetes should limit the portion size because they are high in calories. 3. Eggs Eggs and other protein-rich foods can be an\nimportant part of a diet for people with diabetes. They can help regulate blood sugar levels\nand prevent severe spikes in the short term. Eggs are also rich in vitamins and minerals,\nincluding antioxidants lutein &amp;amp; zeaxanthin, which can help prevent diseases related to\nthe eye. Each egg only contains 80 calories. 4. Peanut Butter To help control blood sugar levels, experts\nrecommend adding some healthy carbs to your diet. Some people find that peanut butter is an\nexcellent substitute for refined carbohydrates like white bread and sugar. These people find that the energy from the\npeanut butter lasts longer than the quick burst of energy from refined carbs. However, it would help to watch how much peanut\nbutter you eat and your salt intake because too much salt can cause high blood pressure\nand other health problems. 5. Green Vegetables People with diabetes should increase their\nintake of green vegetables like spinach, cabbage, or kale, to reduce their risk of developing\ncomplications associated with diabetes. Furthermore, studies have shown that people\nwho eat green vegetables regularly are less likely to get type 2 diabetes or develop complications\nfrom it. 6. Cinnamon Cinnamon can be used in various dishes for\nflavor, but it also has some health benefits. Some research has found that cinnamon can\nimprove insulin sensitivity and reduce blood sugar levels in people who have type 2 diabetes. If you&amp;#39;re interested in taking cinnamon supplements\nor adding it to your food, be sure to use Ceylon cinnamon instead of Cassia cinnamon. Ceylon has more health benefits and fewer\nunpleasant side effects. 7. Dark Chocolate Dark chocolate has many health benefits that\ncan help people with diabetes. Dark chocolate is high in antioxidants, which\ncan help to reduce free radicals in the body and combat inflammation. This means it may help to reduce the risk\nof cardiovascular disease and protect against stroke or heart attack. It also has a higher cocoa content than milk\nchocolate, which studies have shown to improve blood sugar control for people with type 2\ndiabetes after eating. 8. Beans and lentils Beans and lentils have a low glycemic index,\nmeaning they release their sugars into the bloodstream slower than most other foods. They also have a high fiber content with both\nsoluble and insoluble fiber, which can help lower blood sugar levels by slowing down digestion,\nreducing the absorption of sugar from the gut, and increasing feelings of fullness. In addition to lowering blood sugar levels,\nbeans and lentils are also packed with protein that can help those who suffer from insulin\nresistance or those on diabetic 9. Brown rice Brown rice is a whole grain that provides\nfiber and some vitamins and minerals. White rice is a refined grain that has fiber\nand many minerals removed, making it softer. Brown rice is healthier in many ways, but\npeople should still keep their carbohydrate intake in moderation to avoid weight gain. 10. Avocado Avocado contains monounsaturated fatty acids,\nwhich are good for managing blood sugar levels and insulin resistance. It&amp;#39;s also full of fiber and antioxidants that\nhelp keep your body healthy and fit. A research study shows that people who eat\nhalf an avocado with lunch or dinner for 12 weeks can lose more weight than those who\ndon&amp;#39;t add avocados to their meal plan. That&amp;#39;s a roundup of some foods for diabetics\nto eat daily to maintain a healthy lifestyle and take care of their diabetes.",

    "transcript": "foreign medicine made easy now in today&amp;#39;s video we&amp;#39;re going to be discussing key things that you need to know about a medicine commonly used to help control type 2 diabetes which is called metformin in this video we&amp;#39;re going to cover what metformin is used for and how it works who can and can&amp;#39;t take it how and when to take it side effects potential effects in pregnancy and breastfeeding as well as possible interactions as ever if you do find this video useful please remember to give it a thumbs up and subscribe to the channel if you haven&amp;#39;t done so already so what is metformin and what is it used for well metformin is a medicine commonly used to treat type 2 diabetes and gestational diabetes type 2 diabetes is a form of diabetes where the cells in the muscles fat and liver become resistant to the hormone insulin this means that it&amp;#39;s harder for the body to control blood sugar levels gestational diabetes is a form of diabetes which is transient meaning that it occurs during pregnancy and then often disappears after you&amp;#39;ve given birth now whilst these are the two main uses metformin can also be used to help prevent type 2 diabetes if you&amp;#39;re at high risk of developing it and also in something called polycystic ovarian syndrome or PCOS although it&amp;#39;s not officially approved for this use and in this video we&amp;#39;re mainly going to be focusing on its use in diabetes in terms of how it works well metformin lowers your blood sugar levels by improving the way that your body handles insulin and it reduces the amount of sugar that your liver releases into the bloodstream so who can and can&amp;#39;t cake metformin while typically most adults and children aged 10 and over can take Metformin however it&amp;#39;s not suitable for certain individuals especially if you&amp;#39;ve ever had an allergic reaction to metformin you&amp;#39;ve got uncontrolled diabetes you have liver or kidney problems you have a severe infection and you&amp;#39;re being treated for heart failure or you&amp;#39;ve recently had a heart attack or if you&amp;#39;ve got severe problems with your circulation or breathing difficulties or drink a lot of alcohol you may also need to stop taking Metformin before having surgery where general anesthetic is involved this means putting you to sleep for surgery and certain medical tests such as a scam involving an injection of a Dye that contains iodine into the blood this is not a full and comprehensive list and if you&amp;#39;re uncertain about whether you should take Metformin then it&amp;#39;s obviously best to speak to your doctor directly who&amp;#39;s going to be able to advise you on the suitability of Metformin for you this list is just to give you a flavor of some of the key things when metformin might be contraindicated so now let&amp;#39;s take a look and cover when to take metformin and how to take it well metformin typically comes as two different types of tablet standard tablets on the one hand and slow release tablets on the other and it&amp;#39;s also available as a liquid and sachets for children and people who find it difficult to swallow tablets standard tablets release metformin into your body quickly and you may need to take them several times a day depending on what your doctor advises slow release tablets on the other hand work gradually so you don&amp;#39;t have to take them as often in terms of dosing and strength while your doctor will tell you how many tablets to take a day but the maximum daily dose is usually 2 000 milligrams or two grams a day liquid metformin should be taken in five mil Doses and usually ranges between 500 and 1000 milligrams and sachets similarly come in similar doses your doctor will check your blood sugar levels regularly and may change your dose of Metformin if necessary and when you first start taking metformin you&amp;#39;ll be advised to increase the dose slowly because this reduces the chances of getting side effects if you find that the side effects of standard metformin are affecting you too much then your doctor may suggest switching to slow release tablets in terms of how to take it well it&amp;#39;s best to take Metformin tablets with or just after your evening meal to reduce the chances of getting side effects and you should swallow the metformin tablets hole with a drink of water rather than chewing them if you&amp;#39;re taking metformin sachets then pour the powder into a glass and add water around 150 ml stir it if you need to until the water turns clear or slightly cloudy and then drink the metformin straight away treatment for diabetes is usually for life but if your kidneys are not working properly your doctor will tell you to stop taking metformin and switch you to a different medicine and remember don&amp;#39;t stop taking metformin without talking to your doctor because if you stop taking it suddenly your blood sugar levels can go up and it can make your diabetes worse if you accidentally miss a dose of Metformin then skip the mistose and take the next dose of the usual time don&amp;#39;t take two doses to make up for the Forgotten dose if you do take too much respectful and by accident then speak to your doctor you might experience some side effects like stomach pain loose bowel emotions or diarrhea fast breathing or weakness for example now what side effects can you possibly develop well like all medicines metformin can cause side effects although not everybody gets them now there are common side effects of metformin which happen in more than one in a hundred people and these include things such as feeling sick or nauseous being sick so vomiting diarrhea stomach ache loss of appetite and some people do complain of a metallic taste in the mouth taking metformin can also cause a vitamin B12 deficiency this may present with symptoms such as feeling very tired having muscle weakness a sore red tongue issues with your vision or sensation and for a full video on B12 deficiency symptoms and signs please do check out the other video on this channel your doctor it can check your vitamin B12 level and if they&amp;#39;re too low they may prescribe vitamin B12 supplements these can be either as an injection or tablets now some people do ask can my blood sugar become too low from taking metformin well the good news is is that metformin doesn&amp;#39;t usually cause low blood sugar this is known as hypoglycemia or hypos when it&amp;#39;s taken on its own but hypos can happen when you take Metformin with other diabetes medicines such as insulin or glycocide so if you do take Metformin in combination with these other diabetic medications it&amp;#39;s worth knowing about this as a possible side effect if you&amp;#39;re planning to exercise more than usual then make sure you eat carbohydrates like bread pasta or cereals before during or after exercise and if you are diabetic you should always be carrying a fast acting carbohydrate with you so things like sugar cubes fruit juice or some sweets just in case your blood sugar levels do get too low I&amp;#39;ve included more information about hypoglycemia and its symptoms in the description box box of this video you may also need to eat a starchy carbohydrate like a sandwich or a biscuit to maintain your blood sugar levels for longer if you&amp;#39;re finding that this is becoming an increasing problem now serious side effects are rare and they happen in less than one in 10 000 people but you do need to seek urgent medical attention immediately if you get a general feeling of being unwell with severe tiredness fast or shallow breathing being cold and a slow heartbeat you should also seek urgent medical attention if the whites of your eyes turn yellow your skin turns yellow although this may be less obvious on darker skin because this can be a sign of liver problems as a side effect of the metformin there&amp;#39;s also a risk of a serious life-threatening allergic reaction called anaphylaxis however thankfully this is very rare if you do develop swelling of the lip swelling of the tongue and finding it difficult to breathe you must seek urgent medical attention now these are not all of the side effects of metformin and for a full comprehensive list please do see the leaflet inside of your medicine packet or speak to your pharmacist if you have any further questions now let&amp;#39;s briefly discuss the use of Metformin in pregnancy so it&amp;#39;s generally thought that metformin is safe to take during pregnancy either alone or in combination with insulin if your doctor or Midwife says that your baby is healthy is generally thought to be saved to take Metformin whilst breastfeeding metformin passes into the breast milk in tiny amounts and it hasn&amp;#39;t been linked to side effects in any breastfed babies however again if you do have any concerns any worries or questions it is best to speak to your doctor first before taking this or continuing to take it and if you are planning to get pregnant or if you are pregnant again speak to your health provider now what about taking metformin with other medicines or supplements well there are some medicines that can affect the way that metformin works if you&amp;#39;re taking the following medicines your blood sugar levels may need to be checked more often and your dose changed now these are things such as steroid tablets things like prednisolone or hydrocortisone you also should speak to your doctor if you&amp;#39;re taking tablets that make you pee more these are diuretics things like furosemide you should also speak to your doctor if you&amp;#39;re taking medicines to treat heart problems and high blood pressure or hypertension male and female hormones such as testosterone estrogen or progesterone or other diabetes medicines your doctor may need to make a small change to your metformin dose if you&amp;#39;ve just started contraceptive pills this is because contraceptive pills can change how your body handles sugar so that was a broad overview of Metformin including what it is what it&amp;#39;s used for how to take it and possible side effects I do hope you enjoyed the video and learned something new and if you did please remember to like it leave me a comment if you&amp;#39;ve got any thoughts or you&amp;#39;d like to share your experiences of using Metformin please do subscribe to the channel for weekly medical education videos if you&amp;#39;ve not done so already please also check out the references resources that I&amp;#39;ve used to make this video These can be found in the description box and there&amp;#39;s lots more useful information contained within these links and potentially some answers to questions you may have that weren&amp;#39;t contained within this video finally I do have to stress that this has been designed as a general educational video not an individual clinical advice video for legal reasons please read the full disclaimer in the description box and if you do have specific individual questions about your own metformin dosing or levels please do see your own doctor as ever if you have any concerns questions or worries about your own health again and see your own health provider as ever thank you for

    "transcript": "I was wondering whether drinking alcohol is really that bad for someone living with diabetes or whether having a drink or two at a party is actually okay so over the past couple months I tried the most popular alcoholic drinks and after each of them I tested my blood sugar to see if it spiked too high or dropped too low and what I discovered was the most important lesson about alcohol and diabetes that you will ever come across so in this video I&amp;#39;m going to show you if it&amp;#39;s okay to drink alcohol if you&amp;#39;re someone living with diabetes how you can drink alcohol safely without doing too much damage to your body and what the best drink that will keep your butt sugar under control and by the way I&amp;#39;m also going to share with you a story about a night when alcohol almost killed me please keep in mind I&amp;#39;m not a doctor I&amp;#39;m just sharing my experience as someone who&amp;#39;s lived with diabetes for over 35 years the first alcoholic drink I decided to test was beer the reason why I chose beer was simple I come from the Czech Republic and Czechs are known to drink the most beer per capita in the world but is it okay to drink beer for a diabetic well the most iconic cck lugger beer doesn&amp;#39;t have that much alcohol only 4.4% by volume but a small glass of this logger also has about 145 calories and 17 carbs which is quite a lot when I tested my blood sugar after drinking this beer I saw the glucose spiking to around 200 within 45 minutes of drinking it a lot higher than what I would like to see and that&amp;#39;s why I don&amp;#39;t think beer is the best option for people living with diabetes but the interesting thing is that the reason why most beers Spike blood sugar very fast is not the alcohol it&amp;#39;s the high carb content of the beer so if you can&amp;#39;t lift without it try looking for a more blood sugar friendly beer with less carbs Corona Premiere blood visor select or Miller Light might be good options look what my blood sugar did after I drank Corona Premiere the spike is very mild a lot less compared to a traditional beer unfortunately with all these light beers you need to compromise on on taste a little bit but at the end of the day it&amp;#39;s up to you to decide what&amp;#39;s more important whether it&amp;#39;s the taste of the beer or your blood sugar levels now don&amp;#39;t get me wrong I do drink a normal beer from time to time too whenever I do that I usually give myself a little bit of insulin before I start drinking that beer to cover those carbs in the beer and to avoid that blood sugar Spike and this approach works really well for me but another thing you need to keep in mind is that it&amp;#39;s not only about the carbs the alcohol and the beer impact blood sugar too and I&amp;#39;m going to show you how a bit later in this video next I want to talk about the second alcoholic drink I decided to test during my experiment wine now wine is the popular choice amongst many of my friends who live with diabetes because unlike beer wine tends to have a lower carbohydrate content but wine also has higher alcohol content by volume so is it really better than beer let&amp;#39;s break it out an average wi you can buy in most stores and restaurants has somewhere between 11 and 14 % of alcohol but the range can get much wider with some fortified wines reaching the alcohol content of up to 20% now a typical glass of dry wine will have somewhere between 1 and 2 G of carbs which is very low almost negligible and about 100 to 130 calories when I tasted both white and red dry wine my blood sugar after drinking a glass didn&amp;#39;t Spike at all even after the second glass the blood sugar was still flat for the next couple hours that&amp;#39;s why I think that dry wine is really blood sugar friendly and it seems to be a good option for people living with diabetes but we have to keep in mind that not all wines are created equal a glass of sweet wine like dessert wine or sweet sparkling wine can easily have around 15 carbs and 160 calories that&amp;#39;s about as much as a small beer here you can clearly see the difference between a glass of dry red wine and a glass of sweet sparkling wine my blood sugar spite close to 200 after drinking the sweet wine and that&amp;#39;s not what I like to see so always make sure that you know what kind of wine you&amp;#39;re drinking I try to stick to dry wines and not drink too much of it but how much is too much you might be asking okay let&amp;#39;s talk about the elephant in the room I&amp;#39;m sure that when you saw the title of this video the best alcohol for diabetes some of you were thinking well that&amp;#39;s clear the best alcohol for diabetes is no alcohol so is it actually okay to drink alcohol well according to the American Diabetes Association drinking a moderate amount of alcohol regularly may have a positive impact on cardiovascular health and lower your hp1c they approve of one drink per day for women and two drinks per day for men so they seem to allow diabetics to drink daily but is that the right thing to do well I&amp;#39;m not so sure see back in 2005 I was a young man living with type 1 diabetes I was using an insulin pump and I was supposed to prick my finger and check my blood sugar about 10 times per day but let me be honest with you what I really wanted to do back then was explore the world run after girls and go out and have drinks and it didn&amp;#39;t take very long and I found my 21-year-old self at a party drinking beers and shots of whiskey one after another I probably drank like five beers and five shots of whiskey that night and I was having fun but the next thing I remember is an ambulance taking me to hospital I caus my myself an alcohol induced keto acidosis and I spent 36 hours uh in an ICU and to be honest with you I feel ashamed to this day when I think of that night I can hardly imagine the amount of anxiety and embarrassment that my parents must have been through now what I&amp;#39;m trying to say with this story is we need to realize that alcohol plays an important social role in our society it&amp;#39;s really hard to completely avoid it and not make any mistakes if you&amp;#39;re not drinking any alcohol and it works for you it&amp;#39;s perfectly okay I didn&amp;#39;t make this video to encourage you to start drinking but if you do drink alcohol try to keep it in moderation don&amp;#39;t go too crazy because I don&amp;#39;t want you to have to go through what I had to go through on that night when I ended up in hospital now let&amp;#39;s talk a bit more about the drink that played a major role in my previous story whiskey or you know what let&amp;#39;s talk about spirits in general because when you live with diabetes it it doesn&amp;#39;t really matter if you drink whiskey bourbon vodka gin or even tequila during my experiment I tried them all and I can confirm that they have very similar effects on both my blood sugar and the way I feel out of drinking them Spirits typically have around 40% alcohol biolume and slightly over 100 calories per shot so they&amp;#39;re not really that helpful when you&amp;#39;re trying to lose weight but at the same time they have zero carbohydrates you heard me right zero carbs I tested them all and my blood sugar stay pretty much flat after drinking them as long as I didn&amp;#39;t mix them with other things so they might not be healthy but they are blood sugar friendly but most people like to include Spirits in cocktails and mixed drinks and that&amp;#39;s why I decided to test a few of those to see what they will do to my blood sugar the most popular cocktail in the world is Margarita this drink is made of tequila lime juice and Triple sack which is a sweet orange flavored liquor an average Margarita has about 250 calories and 15 G of car and that&amp;#39;s probably why my blood sugar spiked quickly to around 180 Mig per deciliter within about 30 minutes of drinking it so Margarita is not the best drink for someone trying to avoid high blood sugars another Super popular cocktail I tried was mojito this one is made of white rum lime mint leaves clap soda and sugar syrup an average mojito has about 220 calories and 13 carbs coming mostly from the sugar syrup so it&amp;#39;s no surprise that my blood sugar after drinking it spiked about as f fast as after drinking Margarita so mojito is also not a good option for someone trying to avoid those steep blood sugar spikes now the third popular cocktail I tried was Cosmopolitan this one is made of vodka cranberry juice and quantro which again is another sweet orange flavored lur but the thing is an average Cosmo is a lot more sour than Margarita or mojito it has only seven carbs which is not too bad when I looked at my CGM after drinking Cosmo I could see that my blood sugar spiked but not anywhere as much as with traditional mojito or Margarita so Cosmopolitan might be something to consider if you&amp;#39;re in a market for classic blood sugar friendly cocktail but when it comes to mixed drinks I have to admit that my real guilty pleasure is upper or Spritz this drink is made of aerol liquor prco and soda water with 200 calories and 18 cups per an average glass of Apper o it&amp;#39;s a quite calorie and carb heavy drink and that&amp;#39;s why it&amp;#39;s no surprise that my blood sugar spite quickly to over two 200 within about 30 minutes of drinking it definitely not a blood sugar friendly option I will still drink it from time to time though but when I do I usually give myself a little insulin to cover those carbs in Upper Spritz before I start drinking it to avoid that steep blood sugar Spike now it&amp;#39;s becoming clearer and clearer from this experiment that it&amp;#39;s not the alcohol that raises blood glucose it&amp;#39;s the carbs the sugar syrups and the sweetly curse in some of these mixed drinks that make my blood sugar shoot up and make things a lot more challenging for me but don&amp;#39;t worry I&amp;#39;m going to share a few more blood sugar friendly cocktails as well as my absolute favorite drink that doesn&amp;#39;t Spike my blood sugar a bit later in this video now before I do that I need to share another story with you you see on that night when I ended up in hospital I clearly drank way too much beer and that&amp;#39;s why my blood sugar spiked to over 400 I also drank way too much whiskey and alcohol in general which led to vomiting uh dehydration and caused a diabetic keto acidosis or dka since that happened to me I really tried to drink alcohol in moderation and not overdo it because dka is a major risk factor but there is another big concern I have with alcoholic drinks and another risk which is even more common when you are a diabetic remember the chart I was showing you of what my blood sugar does after drinking beer wine or whiskey well I only showed you the first part of it but I didn&amp;#39;t tell you the whole story the thing is when we were drinking alcoholic beverages the initial blood sugar Spike caused by the carbohydrates in the drink is not the only thing we need to worry about there is one more thing that happens to our blood sugar several hours after we drink that alcohol a few years after my first alcohol incident I already knew I should not drink too much but I still enjoyed having a few drinks now and then one night I wanted to go play soccer with friends I didn&amp;#39;t have enough time to eat dinner but I was already late so I didn&amp;#39;t think too much of it and I just left for the soccer game everything went well and after the game we went for a few drinks and I didn&amp;#39;t want to drink beer because I knew it would spike my blood sugar so I just had two or three whiskies on the rocks at this point it was all good and by the time I got home I was super tired and I went straight too bad but the next thing I remember was waking up in the middle of the night all confused I couldn&amp;#39;t quite figure out where I was my blood sugar must have been super low because I was feeling extremely sick and extremely weak but I didn&amp;#39;t have enough energy in me to make myself get up and eat or drink something sweet to bring my blood sugar up I just couldn&amp;#39;t move I was basically paralyzed lying on my bed feeling sick and not being able to move or think clearly the only thing I managed to do using literally all the energy I had in me was wake up my girlfriend at the time who was sleeping next to me I managed to say only a few words to her but I remember these words until today I&amp;#39;m sick help me I&amp;#39;m sick I was repeating that over and over again she managed to bring me a couple of juice boxes and luckily this helped me recover but my blood sugar during that night was as low as 38 Mig per deciliter which is extremely low and very dangerous she literally saved my life by bringing me those juice boxes that I could drink now the reason why I&amp;#39;m sharing this story is that what caused that severe low blood sugar event most likely was the alcohol that I drank the night before and to confirm this Theory I ran an experiment I compared my blood sugar during nights when I didn&amp;#39;t drink any alcohol and during nights after drinking here you can see how my average blood sugar graph looked on those nights without alcohol and here you can see how it looks on those nights with alcohol we can clearly tell that alcohol starts bringing my blood sugar down in the middle of the night and the drop continues into early morning the thing is there is one organ in our body that is programmed to protect us from these kinds of low blood sugar events it&amp;#39;s liver whenever our blood sugar starts dropping too low the liver starts releasing glucose to bring the blood sugar back to a safe Zone but when the liver is too busy with breaking down alcohol it doesn&amp;#39;t have enough capacity to produce glucose and bring blood sugar up and that&amp;#39;s why my blood sugar not only didn&amp;#39;t Spike that night it did the exact opposite it dropped really low it was a combination of the alcohol the physical AC activ it and the fact that I didn&amp;#39;t eat any dinner that made that night really scary and what I learned from this is that whenever I drink alcohol I need to make sure I don&amp;#39;t skip meals I also need to reduce my basil insulin dose during the night after drinking to avoid those scary blood sugar drops but I promised you that I would share my top three blood sugar friendly drinks with you so here they are starting with number three you can have this one in almost every bar it&amp;#39;s really refreshing it has practically zero carbs it&amp;#39;s sugar-free mojito just ask the waiter or waitress to not add any sugar or any sugar syrup they&amp;#39;ll know what you mean now some of you might like the no sugar version of mojito but the problem many of you might have is that the drink will now be too sour luckily there is an easy way to fix it just ask for a sweetener almost every restaurant or a bar has one so add the sweetener in your mojito and you can really do this with any cocktail that uses sugary syrup so it also works for drinks like oldfashioned Long Island iced tea or my taii by the way here you can see what my blood sugar did after a glass of sugar-free mojito literally no blood sugar Spike the line is practically flat now of course sweeteners are not the healthiest thing ever especially not the generic ones they have in most bar but you can always bring your own my favorite is probably Stevia which offers a reasonable balance between an acceptable taste sweetness and healthiness if that&amp;#39;s even a word now moving on to my favorite drink number two if you watch some of my previous videos you might know that I really like Scotch whiskey now most whiskey drinkers will tell you that you should drink whiskey neat but to be honest I also find it quite nice to pour the whiskey over several ice cubes and mix it with some club soda to create a blood sugar friendly cocktail this simple drink has no added sugar no cars and only about 105 calories look at the graph whiskey and soda doesn&amp;#39;t Spike my blood sugar at all the only thing I need to worry about is a potential drop in my blood glucose a few hours later but if you don&amp;#39;t like whiskey you could try to do the same thing with the spirit of your choice just mix it with ice cubes and soda and see if you like it now before I reveal my number one drink I need to touch on something super important when it comes to diabetes and alcohol the goal I have with this YouTube channel is for everyone who is watching to live a full life with diabetes while achieving balanced blood sugar and lower hba1c but I&amp;#39;m not here to tell you whether or not you should drink alcohol that&amp;#39;s really up to you to decide I&amp;#39;m just here to share my experience and provide you with some practical strategies so that you can make an occasional drink or two part of your life if you want to and so that you can make it safely and don&amp;#39;t make the same mistakes I made by the way I&amp;#39;m currently developing a dedicated group coaching program the blood sugar Academy and I&amp;#39;m really excited because this program will be here to help you manage your blood sugar at challenging real life situations like having a drink or two at a party might be my goal is to launch the blood sugar Academy later this year for the the first 10 to 20 people so if you want to be part of the first group just click the link below and register your interest and I will be sure to share more information with you once the program is launched but here is my number one alcoholic drink that I drink most often again you can get this one at every bar and make it in so many variations as you know I&amp;#39;ve been known for my diet coke addiction and that&amp;#39;s why my favorite alcoholic drink can be no other than whiskey and Coke I know it&amp;#39;s not the healthiest thing in the world but I just think it tastes great and it doesn&amp;#39;t mess with my blood sugar as long as I don&amp;#39;t drink too many of them I will be fine look at my blood sugar graph after drinking whiskey with Diet Coke it&amp;#39;s perfectly Flatline if you don&amp;#39;t like whiskey you can replace it with any other spirit and if you don&amp;#39;t want to drink diet coke you can replace it with any other diet soda now if you live with diabetes then you know that the one thing that&amp;#39;s even more challenging than alcohol when it comes to blood sugar control is fruit many people will tell you that you should not eat any fruit if you&amp;#39;re diabetic but I don&amp;#39;t agree with that statement and I did a similar video to this one so go ahead click here and watch that video about the best fruit for diabetes next I will see you there ciao",

    "transcript": "[Laughter] [Music] hello steve edelman here today we&amp;#39;re going to talk about marijuana and more specifically marijuana and diabetes i&amp;#39;m here with my very good friend and pothead dr jeremy pettis thanks for that intro i think but um yeah so we&amp;#39;re going to talk about marijuana and diabetes because it&amp;#39;s becoming an increasingly popular question that we get you know what is the deal with marijuana specifically with diabetes and let&amp;#39;s just start with some of the facts that you know marijuana is legal in some shape or form in most states now not every single state and there&amp;#39;s millions of people using marijuana products you know smoking edibles etc there&amp;#39;s actually more people that use marijuana in the united states than there are people with diabetes i mean it&amp;#39;s an extremely common medication whatever you want to call it and when it comes to how does it affect blood sugars and our kind of diabetes health the ques the answer is we actually really just don&amp;#39;t know so if somebody tells you marijuana actually does this to your diabetes they don&amp;#39;t really know the whole truth um they&amp;#39;re probably high yeah like exactly so you know when you think about marijuana what&amp;#39;s one of the first things that come to mind when you say oh that you know you&amp;#39;re smoking marijuana you think well you get the munchies right so then people will think well then that must not be good for you if you have diabetes because you&amp;#39;re eating more and all that and that makes sense but interestingly if you just survey and they&amp;#39;ve done this people that use marijuana products type twos type ones and people without diabetes people that use marijuana regularly tend to be thinner even though they have the munchies and they&amp;#39;re eating you know or haven&amp;#39;t come an increased appetite they tend to be thinner they tend to have better cholesterols and they may be more insulin sensitive so there&amp;#39;s this kind of paradox of like well if they&amp;#39;re eating more then why are they losing weight and we don&amp;#39;t know and i always tell people when you think about the classic stoner i think shaggy from scooby-doo you know and what does shaggy look like you know what shaggy looks like yeah i&amp;#39;ve seen i know he&amp;#39;s like real thin you know that&amp;#39;s kind of the classic stoner is this really skinny person so you know we&amp;#39;re actually starting to do research in this and at ucsd where we work there&amp;#39;s actually a center for medicinal cannabis research which puts out grants to study you know cannabis in different areas and i applied for and received this grant to study it in type 2 diabetes and i have to tell you i&amp;#39;ve you know we got this grant but i&amp;#39;ve been blown away with how difficult it is to do research studies in cannabis or marijuana products it is far more difficult to get any kind of marijuana product than it would be for any other diabetes drug metformin you name it and it&amp;#39;s crazy because you and i right now could walk down the street and go buy anything we want you know cannabis wise because it&amp;#39;s legal here in california but we couldn&amp;#39;t just go buy metformin you know you have to have a prescription so there&amp;#39;s this real disconnect between how easy it is for the public to get it and how difficult it is to do research in it any differences between type 1 and type 2 and relationship with marijuana we don&amp;#39;t really know yet you know there are some reports and type ones that people that use it might have higher rates of dka so this is all kind of anecdotal but we don&amp;#39;t know what happens if someone you know wasn&amp;#39;t using it and all of a sudden you know started using it so in doing this research now um the fda has these like kind of schedule of medications one two three and schedule one is like the kind of like the worst um most dangerous most dangerous therapies these are things that are declared to have zero medicinal purposes they&amp;#39;re highly addictive you never would ever want to use them things like um uh methamphetamines heroin and marijuana is in that category so it is like the you know according to the fda the most dangerous substance and because of that extremely difficult to research i&amp;#39;m having to apply right now for special fda to prescribe marijuana just in my study and i have to list out you know why i&amp;#39;m using it the kind of the whole protocol et cetera can you call somebody at my pharmacy once i get it approved i will but um so passionate use i&amp;#39;m just you know it&amp;#39;s been amazing for me to go through this process and and it&amp;#39;s so clear to me why we don&amp;#39;t have the answers right now so what we&amp;#39;re left telling patients and when you guys are watching um what to do about it really it&amp;#39;s kind of common sense at this point obviously use it you know legally whatever your state you know mandates and if you are going to use it in kind of moderation and typically what we say is that you know when it comes to alcohol alcohol can have a direct effect on your blood sugars the alcohol itself usually lowers your blood sugars we have a whole video about us you know drinking alcohol and talking about it so alcohol itself has a direct effect on blood sugars marijuana we think is more of an indirect effect that maybe you&amp;#39;re not as with it as you might be maybe you have munchies you know it it changes your habits and not so much directly on the blood sugars but that&amp;#39;s kind of all we know for now so if you use it use it legally use it safely and just wait for our research studies to come out i appreciate that two last things on in our video vault on our website jeremy gives an excellent lecture on some of the scientific background between marijuana and diabetes and the other thing is if you&amp;#39;ve ever been to a medicinal store you can get vapes you can get like you said edibles and how do you study each of those forms of marijuana so just be careful what&amp;#39;s our next challenge you do edibles all smoking see what happens so we&amp;#39;ll see you for that one guys okay take care [Laughter] [Music] you",

    "transcript": "have doctors in China come up with the cure for [Music] diabetes I&amp;#39;m Dr Eric Westman and welcome to my channel where I review and debunk nutritional misinformation online in this article we&amp;#39;re going to read about how stem cell therapy has been used to recreate the pancreatic function and the doctors are claiming that this reverses diabetes for the first time be sure to till the end to get my final thoughts thanks for sending this which turns out to be a press release but it was based on an article that I could read of course when you&amp;#39;re consuming information you want to be sure if it&amp;#39;s just a press release that it&amp;#39;s based on a article that&amp;#39;s published or maybe it&amp;#39;s based on an abstract at a meeting it&amp;#39;s a lot harder to get information about the study at an abstract at a meeting in fact in the research world it&amp;#39;s thought of as sort of in its preliminary stage of being publicly presented if it&amp;#39;s just at a meeting so in this case the researchers say they have cured diabetes for the first time and it&amp;#39;s based on an article in the Journal of cell Discovery just this year and the press press release basically says that the experimental treatment created an artificial version of cells found in the pancreas that produce insulin and keep the blood sugar levels in check and so this man had had diabetes for 25 years and had lost almost all function of these cells known as eyelets and this goes along with our current understanding of diabetes when you&amp;#39;re not involving lifestyle change so it&amp;#39;s possible that after years and years of eating carbohydrate and making your pancreas work over over time basically making insulin that your pancreas can run out of insulin of course it&amp;#39;s a relative running out of insulin because if you stop the carbohydrates your body may actually revert to normal blood sugars without a pancreatic transplant so the first thing that is a debunking of this press release is that you can reverse diabetes right now without a stem cell transplant and yes it does involve lifestyle Chang so back to the article and the press release it does say that up until this point no one has ever cured of diabetes Well it&amp;#39;s a matter of semantics here yes you can cure diabetes what they&amp;#39;re saying here doctors have figured out how to put it in remission well so here the putting in remission or curing it or the what I do in my clinic every day in the words of this abstract and press release this requires the patients to keep up a relatively strict diet and exercise program to stop the blood sugar problems from returning well forget the exercise part actually it can be done simply by changing the diet but here is kind of the classic idea of let&amp;#39;s just give a pill and manage the diabetes or or a shot or or why don&amp;#39;t we give stem cells to recreate the pancreas so that you can just eat whatever you want and then you won&amp;#39;t have diabetes Well I guess that would be all well and good so the idea here is that you are recreating or regenerating the organ the pancreas internally by injecting cells that can actually turn into or mimic the cells of the pancreas it&amp;#39;s actually a pretty awesome idea when you think of it and so stem cell therapy has given the The Hope and the promise that the cellular function even organ function can be replaced if you just teach these stem cells that are sort of the the the the basis of all these different other cells teach them what to do teach them how to sense the glucose teach them how to respond well that would be the eyet cells so basically you&amp;#39;re turning these stem cells into pancreatic eyelid cells you&amp;#39;re injecting them into the body or or transplanting them under the skin or however you do it so that the body itself will notice that the blood sugar is a certain level the tissue that you&amp;#39;ve injected will secrete the pancreatic enzyme insulin needed to keep the blood glucose down automatically it&amp;#39;s a great idea and the of course the first debunking is that you can reverse diabetes without a stem cell transplant right now but let&amp;#39;s say that we could that would be a great thing I think you know there are a lot of people who can&amp;#39;t change your lifestyle or don&amp;#39;t have the ability to get access to the right right Foods or right information well there a lot of people are on medication still to manage diabetes and those folks of course can reverse and put the diabetes into remission and Cure by changing the lifestyle but so this well like a drug why don&amp;#39;t we just inject a stem cell that replaces and replenishes the body&amp;#39;s pancreatic function okay well the the study itself was actually a case report of one person so according to this study there were studies done in animals like mice and that was started there and so now here they put it into a 25 year history someone who had 25 year history of type 2 diabetes to to try to get the pancreatic function back and apparently they did so that the idea here is the cells started to become pancreatic cells and sensed the blood glucose and performed and secreted the insulin required to lower the blood glucose independent of what the person was eating now in the study they really didn&amp;#39;t talk about what the person was eating and that of course would be very important to know but assuming they&amp;#39;re trying to fix the problem without regard to what people are putting in their mouths just let&amp;#39;s assume that they were still eating lots of carbohydrates and so the case presented basically high blood glucoses and low insulin levels reversed by giving the stem cells which turned into pancreatic cells and so it seems just almost too good to be true well we have to understand that this is just one person and this is a a a study in his infancy and yet we know a lot about transplantation of cells this goes way back I remember in my own training being on a bone marrow transplant sort of Ward and even with any sort of transplantation there are several serious issues that come into play so for example if you had a kidney transplant or a liver or heart transplant or here stem cells that if they have the signature or the the cells signature or you would say fingerprint of of not of yourself so that it&amp;#39;s a foreign fingerprint your body will want to attack these organs or the cells and so this is actually the the idea that your body wants to reject the tissue if it&amp;#39;s not seen as it&amp;#39;s self and so this is a problem with transplantation of another person&amp;#39;s kidney into you for example so this is a matter your body wants to reject the tissue that&amp;#39;s not itself and this actually gets into the idea of autoimmunity as well if your body sees foreign tissue but then mistakes your own tissue for the foreign tissue it will start being reacting to itself but in in this case with transplantation of any sort of tissue you have to have these concerns and and over time the graft itself if it has immune function in it let&amp;#39;s say you&amp;#39;re transplanting the bone marrow which has immune function the The graft itself can actually attack the host called graph versus host disease so that if there&amp;#39;s some immune function that&amp;#39;s being transplanted that transplantation can actually attack the host so there&amp;#39;s the concern with any transplantation that that the body will reject what was transplanted and that the transplant has some immune cells that will actually start attacking the person who that was just had the organ or tissue transplanted inside so I these are pretty serious issues that require either long-term medication treatment or just very careful selection of the tissue that&amp;#39;s being transplanted so it&amp;#39;s not clear to me whether these cells will have the the host signature or the the signature of someone else and that makes a big difference in terms of the immunosuppression needed and immunosuppression usually is a strong medication like prednizone or other anti-inflammatory anti-immune medication that has its own side effects in the long run so relatively speaking why not just cut the car and see if you can turn you know turn around the diabetes reverse it put it into cure remission of diabetes is one year of no evidence of diabetes normal blood sugars I see that routinely cure of diabetes is defined as five years no evidence of diabetes and I see that as well so these are standard definitions used for for Cancers and for diabetes and so this isn&amp;#39;t the first time time that diabetes has been cured although if you&amp;#39;re imagining that you&amp;#39;re replacing the pancreas maybe this is one of the first times that you&amp;#39;ve been able to replace the pancreas and have the person eat and drink whatever they want and still get the pancreatic response to keep the blood sugar down it&amp;#39;s simpler to me to just teach people how not to raise the blood glucose as much not raise that sugar so basically avoiding the carbohydrates the sugars and starches and the diet is a very effective way as well so it&amp;#39;s kind of exciting it&amp;#39;s kind of it&amp;#39;s a high-tech way to perhaps reverse not only diabetes but other issues and and I&amp;#39;m very hopeful that this information will be helpful right now though you don&amp;#39;t have to wait for this this is in its infancy you can actually take action with your lifestyle change to reverse diabetes hope that&amp;#39;s helpful please like subscribe and ring the notification Bell I&amp;#39;m putting out new

to build this capability I want to also tell a deeper story this breakthrough is part of a larger movement in medicine the dawn of what I think of as medicine 4.0 not quite Godlike in its capabilities but uncomfortable close let&amp;#39;s dive in the story of diabetes stretches back Millennia in ancient Egypt around 5050 BCE diabetes first entered the medical lexicon in the eers Papyrus one of the oldest medical texts it described a disease characterized by two great emptying of urine they really had away with words these early Physicians didn&amp;#39;t know what caused it but they observed its devastating effects unquenchable thirst thirst dramatic weight loss and eventual death our medicine version 1.0 phase very much can be summarized as a wizard told me to do it our approach was characterized by treating illness as much as a spiritual problem as a physical one and treatments included Herbal Remedies like bitter gourd the oil of roses broken red coral sweet almonds which at least sounds kind of palatable combined with spiritual practices such as chanting mantras and meditation to balance the mind and body these approaches gener were unsuccessful but even as early as Egyptian times medicine 2.0 developed and it showed a different approach doctors embraced empirical study and recordkeeping and turned to much more natural remedies rather than spiritual ones around 400 BCE across the Indian subcontinent enough cases have been seen that diabetes could be recognized by another unmistakable sign the sweetness of urine which is a phrase I don&amp;#39;t say that often Physicians noticed that ants would swarm around the urine of a Ed individuals drawn to the unusually high levels of sugar within they called it honey urine disease and noted two distinct forms an aggressive type often seen in children fatal within weeks or months and a less severe form affecting heavy wealthy people which is humorous if not an unfortunate demographic description but shows evidence of systematically trying to understand who this disease affects they had correctly stumbled upon what we now classify as type 1 and type 2 diabetes and their treatment approach is also started to make a little bit more sense seeing it related to larger individuals they prescribed exercise and specific diets diets were rich in things like wheat and Grains bones and fish or maybe slightly less pleasantly grit green lead and Earth ah they were doing so well others prescribed nothing but raw meat or even chalk hoping to slow the body&amp;#39;s apparent self-destruction the good news some of these treatments did actually have some level of effect and diet and lifestyle change is still recommended for all types of diabetics but for many it wasn&amp;#39;t enough but here is a

Beyond diet and exercise medicine 2.0 started to feature compounds with genuine therapeutic properties in the 18th and 19th centuries milk of the poppy more commonly understood to be an early version of today&amp;#39;s morphine became a popular treatment for diabetics the problem with medicine 2.0 is that these natural therapeutic remedies had an effect but often not the exact one that you were looking for morphine didn&amp;#39;t cure diabetes but it did dull the symptoms and perhaps the anguish of these patients dealing with their range of enforced diets our entry though into medicine 3.0 came when we started to command specific targeted therapies finding the specific key in the human body and unlocking it to cure or treat disease for diabetes this came alongside a breakthrough in the late 19th century by German scientists Joseph foring and Oscar manowski who discovered that removing the pancreas from dogs caused them to develop diabetes and sparking a race to uncover the specific substance in the pancreas responsible for controlling glucose levels this was finally solved in 1921 when in a small laboratory in Toronto Canada Frederick Banting and Charles best successfully extracted insulin from the pancreas of a cow and injected it into diabetic dogs leading to an almost immediate and full reversal for the first time in history of the symptoms of diabetes the following year in January of 1922 they administered the first human treatment to a 14-year-old boy named Leonard Thompson as they administered it over the course of just a few minutes Thompson awoke from a lethargy back to full and vibrant Consciousness it must have felt like a miracle while not a perfect cure insulin gave patients their first real Lifeline allowing them to manage their condition and live longer and healthier lives this ability to bind or block to particular receptors defined this era and included everything from penicillin which blocks bacterial cell wall synthesis to treat infections to things like car te therapies where we teach the body&amp;#39;s natural defense to bind to and Destroy cancer cells and while this might seem like a wildly diverse set of tools they&amp;#39;re all kind of playing the same game they block bind duck dip dive and Dodge their targets in pretty much the same way to varying levels of complexity and although that is very powerful some things are just more complicated than these tools alone can solve the creation of artificial insulin is just a simple binder to insulin receptors in the body and it isn&amp;#39;t without its flow patients still have to meticulously monitor their blood sugar levels and inject insulin multiple times each day inject too little insulin and glucose levels sit too high above 7 millimolar when fasted is a state known as hypoglycemia and starts doing damage to our eyes our nervous systems and at more extreme ends induces keto acidosis and potentially death which generally people hate inject too much insulin and glucose levels crash below 4 mola the body becomes hypo glycemic at the mild end resulting in dizziness and maybe grumpiness and at the extreme end induces coma and potentially death our bodies do this monitoring and management to within just three Miller incredibly effectively when they are working but when you have to inject insulin yourself you&amp;#39;re essentially operating your body on hard mode even if you use monitors and pumps these systems can all still fail this leads us to a point where you can&amp;#39;t just help but think nature did it better what if you could create a medicine that didn&amp;#39;t rely on engineering Solutions or manual dosing but instead was self-aware capable of detecting how much glucose is present in Blood and understanding when it should be operating and changing its Form and Function to meet your body&amp;#39;s needs what I am talking about is Nan machine son or at least something that looks quite a lot like it but how would we actually build them special agent gxo benzo metamine there is one significant problem with glucose to a chemist it looks a lot like fructose or sucrose or many other sugars to an optical physicist like me it looks kind of embarrassingly like water because of all the hydrogen bonds it even kind of looks like paracetamol that&amp;#39;s a problem if we want to make a medicine that can respond to glucose levels in the blood supply we don&amp;#39;t want it accidentally triggering if someone has a headache that&amp;#39;s going to lead to a bad time and probably a lawsuit it was with this challenge that our story starts at the chemistry department at the University of Bristol the University I did my PhD at in a group led by Professor Tony Davis developing a class of chemistry called synthetic lectins these are artificially designed proteins that mimic Nature&amp;#39;s ability to recognize and bind to specific carbohydrate structures like glucose the challenge in designing these molecules is to build something that binds to glucose and only glucose not fructose or paracetamol and that it binds tightly and quickly but at some point it releases otherwise it&amp;#39;s essentially removing glucose from the blood supply this is an unbelievably difficult chemical challenge but after many years of research some very primitive candidates were produced with approximately the right properties leading to this nature paper and now I think it&amp;#39;s worth noting here after big breakthroughs like this advancements often kind of go quiet much to the internet commenters annoyance it&amp;#39;s a video in itself but in an overly short summary this is because academic funding supports the development of breakthroughs not then advancing those breakthroughs to the point when they are useful equally you might say well this is surely where industry should step in maybe but it rarely happens because these ideas are still very early need a lot of work and may still fail we are lucky in that in Tony&amp;#39;s lab was Harry a PhD student who in 2015 thought to launch a startup to fill the gap of moving this breakthrough forward so it didn&amp;#39;t end up just as a really cool PDF things went really well for Harry until a year later when he hired me as technical employee number four or five straight out of my pH HD as head of engineering which is reasonably easy when there&amp;#39;s only two people in the engineering team he tried to give me the title of lead engineer but I proudly said sorry I&amp;#39;m a physicist so my title became lead physicist and immediately that backfired when people read my title on email and thought I was a lead physicist as in studies lead so there you go there&amp;#39;s some level of karmic justice for all the engineers out there we had a pretty hard journey as a startup we realized there wasn&amp;#39;t any wet lab space in Bristol for startups so we ended up building our own building our engineering team was incredibly distracted ible and ended up building an electric skateboard controlled by a laptop my theory here was that if we got it working you could commute and do work at the same time ended reasonably badly luckily the chemistry team was some of the best in the world and turned the chemistry from only possible if the stars aligned to something about a million times better than anything produced by mankind or nature before A system that bound and released glucose and only glucose but there&amp;#39;s an obvious question here that we&amp;#39;ve been skirting around which is that&amp;#39;s not a medicine how do you actually make it useful to answer that question we need to look at the current medicines that are being used the hormone insulin that diabetics inject to regulate their sugar levels if you look at insulin you notice that it has a long thick region in the middle and then these two long spindly arms that sort of float and flow like a gentle version of those inflatable guys outside of gas stations If These Arms of insulin are free insulin is a great molecule and binds easily to insulin receptors in the body via a binding site somewhere on the thicker part of the molecule the body then kicks into action storing glucose into muscles and fat and slowing down the liver&amp;#39;s production of additional glucose to reduce the blood sugar levels in the body however if you connect the two arms together they Link in such a way that they block access to insulin receptor&amp;#39;s binding site and Insulin can no longer dock essentially switching it off the Breakthrough idea was to attach the glucose binding molecule to one arm of insulin and to bind something similar to glucose that wasn&amp;#39;t glucose to the other one for this we picked a glucoside basically glucose plus a couple of additional atoms this would in theory then do something amazing when there is sugar in the blood supply the glucose binding molecule will catch and release the glucose happily over and over again and Insulin will be free to function as expected however if sugar levels fall and there isn&amp;#39;t anything for the glucose binding molecule to catch even though the gluc side isn&amp;#39;t a perfect fit the fact that it is so close means that it will start to have weak binding interactions these will pin the arms of glucose together covering insulin&amp;#39;s binding sight and turning it off should the glucose levels rise again glucose would start to out compete The glucoside Binding and Insulin would snap open reactivating it was at this point with this exciting idea around 2018 when the team started to realize doing all of this alone was going to be really hard they were very fortunate at at this point to team up with Nova NIS one of the largest suppliers of insulin in the world and conversations got kind of interesting and ultimately Novo decided to purchase the company and continue the collaboration by this point I kind of felt like I had made the contribution that I could to this endeavor and had slightly phased myself out of the process and took a very small windfall from the event remember just an employee to start helping out other scientists to turn their Theory into action and started building companies with Academic Teams around the world the majority of the chemistry team though stayed collaborating with Novo and a couple of months ago after 6 years of further work they got there publishing again in nature they produced a modified insulin molecule that is able to self-regulate now here they decided to give it the somewhat catchy name of nnc 2215 not to be confused with NCC 2215 which obviously is the Starship carrier USS genion pretty sure that was intentional the very complicated bit that you may have spotted I entirely glanced over was getting this insulin to work in a human at physiological conditions it needed to deactivate below a precise 4 molar of glucose to keep the sugar levels where we actually want them in the human body tuning that system is what took 6 years to study how nnc interacts with the insulin receptor they compared the receptor affinity for nnc to its affinity for human insulin and a current clinically used form of long acting basal insulin you can see here each system gives broadly similar responses when tested in the presence of 20 Millar glucose however when the glucose concentrations are decreased is when interesting things start to happen at 10 millimolar human insulin and the basil insulin perfectly recreate the same binding Behavior as at 20 millimolar but for the nnc insulin there is a reduction in binding strength this trend continues at 5 3 and 0 Milla glucose in solution The Binding is 12.5 times weaker when glucose levels are at zero molar compared to at 20 molar exactly as theorized the team had produced the world&amp;#39;s first insulin capable of understanding the world around it to see how this medicine behaved in the body the research team also ran some animal studies in diabetic animals they supplied them with a constant intravenous dose of glucose to simulate a meal they then added either normal insulin in one population or nnc in another population to simulate how a diabetic injects insulin to regulate their sugar levels they tuned the quantities of both glucose and Insulin so that the blood sugar levels were held constant then they stopped the glucose line simulating the end of a meal this caused immediately the glucose levels in both populations to plummet for the basil insulin population their blood glucose levels drop to a dangerous low similar to if a diabetic patient injects too much insulin and hit concentrations as low as three mamola hypoglycemia where researchers immediately stepped in to restart the glucose Supply to prevent damage to the animals for the nnc insulin glucose levels dropped rapidly but suddenly started to Plateau at around 4.5 Moler the nnc insulin had automatically deactivated itself preventing further glucose absorption and keeping glucose levels within a healthy tolerance despite nnc insulin continuing to be administered to put this in context this would mean that diabetics would never again have to worry about accidentally over or underdosing insulin they could administer confidently that if they got their numbers even slightly wrong the insulin would deactivate itself to keep them safe this like I said is the most advanced medicine I have ever seen and yes I am still biased and just to emphasize I have no Financial or otherwise connection to this work or output I just think it is Ultra Cool Science this rightfully has been echoed by several people as the culmination of thousands of years of Humanity&amp;#39;s work to produce the best diabetic treatment possible I am incredibly proud of all the team members that have worked on this for so many years to bring this together the question might be what happens next we are clearly entering medicine 4.0 we have many other types of medicine coming to Market at the moment specifically things like Cancer Treatments that can do clever things like react to pH levels or temperature levels so that they only damage cancer cells and not the rest of the body we also have awesome things that I&amp;#39;ve covered on the channel before like this domestic icated nanor robot that can deliver medicine right to where it is needed within the body like a more helpful version of The Sentinel from The Matrix this nnc insulin needs further refinement improving out before it is fully ready for use by human beings but my hope is that this is firmly in its future what does that future look like though to get us to Medicine 5.0 which is where we secretly have all been wanting to get to because everyone has been watching way too much Warhammer 40K Universe recently medicine 5.0 probably looks like either building an organ that produces these sorts of medicines directly in the human body awesome or more realistically learns to regrow regraft or repopulate cells back on the organs that need them some work has already started trying to regrow the cells on the pancreas to reenable its own insulin production capabilities but this work is still many years away here I also want to leave off on a little bit of a reality check and a more positive note we have to talk about pricing Rising insulin prices has more than tripled in a your span insulin in particular has received a lot of press for unfair price points especially in the US a 2020 study found that the average price per vial of insulin in the US was more than $98 compared to less than $8 in the UK that but very simply is brutal there is no other way to put it there have been some positive changes recently such as the inflation reduction act which caps insulin prices for Medicare recipients at $35 I still think that more can be done here and this is coming from some someone that runs a venture capital fund let me say it loud and clearly I want fair pricing for medicine yes pricing Dynamics differ significantly between countries but time and time again when you look at centralized Healthcare Systems you see the benefit of having bulk negotiating power zenic cost $938,000 sort of breakthrough is becoming more and more common and what I love is that these are not originating in large pharmaceutical Giants or big corporations but are coming straight out of University Labs we used to just think of tech Bros dropping out of college and starting software companies now it&amp;#39;s less Tech Bros dropping out and more scientists doing phds to produce cuttingedge insulins quantum computers or new Energy Technologies these Innovations are fundamentally reshaping entire Industries and they&amp;#39;re starting in a place where curiosity and dis Discovery reign supreme I think is a good time to be a scientist this was a really fun story for me to tell obviously it has been a huge part of my life for maybe 10 years or so now but I only wanted to share it once I had kind of a nearly ending to The Thing obviously there is still a ton of work to do but hopefully one day this technology will make its way into the hands of the people that will most benefit from it as for me when I&amp;#39;m not on YouTube I still help scientists upskill and Entrepreneurship and co-found startups with with them currently I&amp;#39;m raising my second Venture Capital fund so that breakthroughs like these receive the funding that they need if you are a scientist in a university lab working on something cool and would like support to turn Theory into action I will leave some links down the description below for how to get in touch with some of my teams if you think scientists are rock stars consider grabbing yourself a t-shirt like this one down in the link below I donate all the proceeds to schools and Charities to help them buy science and school supplies if you like this video feel free to leave a like

    "transcript": "hello guys today we are going to talk about A1C so what is A1C this commonly asked question and today I&amp;#39;m specifically answering Barbara Williamson&amp;#39;s question where she asked in our what is normal blood sugar video and I think I mentioned A1C in that video and she&amp;#39;s asking what is really Avon C and everybody asking the same question so let&amp;#39;s talk about it I am Dr Ahmed arrogen I am the founder of sugarmds.com again our primary purpose is to serve you remotely so we can take care of your diabetes using technology uh not that you have to be tech savvy but we will make it easy for you where you don&amp;#39;t have to leave your home and you can still see us and make sure your diabetes under control and reduce the number of medications now let&amp;#39;s move on to the topic so why we measure A1C right so A1C is a test that&amp;#39;s commonly used is a standardized test so but most people have trouble understanding what the Avon C is so why do we call it A1C or hemoglobin A1c in a better term because we are measuring the glucose within your hemoglobin now hemoglobin is a protein in your blood that is subject to carry your oxygen from A to B so your your hemoglobin is getting oxygenated in your lungs and carrying that oxygen to the rest of the body now the same hemoglobin is permeable which means that it is open to the transfusion of glucose into itself so it opens its arms to the glucose so as a result the more glucose you have in your system the more glucose will be in your hemoglobin so that&amp;#39;s what we are measuring now why do we measure that every three months that&amp;#39;s the next question right so that is because your hemoglobin lives for three months so as a result assuming that your hemoglobins are living three months the glucose they accumulate in three months will be tested and then we can tell exactly how much your blood sugars are running based on how much glucose is in the hemoglobin there is a percentage it&amp;#39;s reported as a percentage and every percentage corresponds to an average blood sugar it is a perfect test barely but we&amp;#39;ll talk about the advantages and disadvantages of this test now so before we dive into details let&amp;#39;s talk about what do the results mean so sometimes I tell people okay your A1C is seven percent or they&amp;#39;ll tell that their A1C is six percent eight percent ten percent whatever when I ask my patients okay what does that mean to you and they say oh I think it&amp;#39;s supposed to be less than seven let&amp;#39;s suppose to be less than 6.5 they don&amp;#39;t they don&amp;#39;t really know what it means right so as an educated patient which is the best patient right so if you know what A1C is at the end of this video you&amp;#39;re going to be an Avon c pro you&amp;#39;re going to be able to teach everybody about A1C but the bottom line at least you should understand if nothing else from this video that every percentage in Avon C corresponds to an average blood sugar so six percent is on average 120 right so seven percent is 150. so every one percent increase or the decrease in your blood sugars corresponds to to a 30 milligram per deciliter change in your in your overall blood sugars so if you&amp;#39;re going from six percent to seven percent that means that your average blood sugars are Rising by 30 milligram per deciliter on average so six percent is 120 7 is 150 8 is 180 and then it goes on so if you go to like uh for example I want to calculate I&amp;#39;m going to cheat here so if you go look 12 percent that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s around three three hundred so but you can make an easy calculation about that so I hope that&amp;#39;s easy to understand and we&amp;#39;ll move on to the next topic now a lot of people are also confused about their Avon seagull right there&amp;#39;s a lot of things said and done about this Avon C uh now of course uh clinicians actually determine the Avon seagull the universal goal is less than seven percent and the reason there&amp;#39;s a universal goal is because they use Avon C in studies to determine the risk reduction so for example if your A1C goes down one percent you&amp;#39;re actually overall risk of diabetic complications can go down by 30 percent so as a result they determined that if you stay below seven percent overall for the entire population that is a good Target to keep patients with diabetes under control now of course the lower the sugar the better um so we want to keep actually young diabetics who just got diagnosed in the first five eight years of diabetes or even 10 years we want to keep them as low as possible less than 6.5 down to six percent that&amp;#39;s all okay I have a lot of patience with Avon C down to 5.7 5.5 not even in the diabetic range because of the approaches we have and they almost live their life almost free of diabetes right so that is possible so what I say to my patients with the A1C goal is as low as reasonably achievable what does it mean to bring the Avon C you have to bring your average blood sugars down right so to do that you have to use sometimes strong medications and some medications can cause very low blood sugars I know if you ever had a low blood sugar but it&amp;#39;s not a pleasant experience it is very very difficult to go through that experience now if you&amp;#39;re having low blood sugars frequently yes your A1C will go down right why because your average blood sugar will go down because you&amp;#39;re if you&amp;#39;re running low frequently your average will be low as well but that&amp;#39;s not what we want that&amp;#39;s one of the downside of Avon C is that just because your A1C is down doesn&amp;#39;t mean that you are doing great you may still be having a lot of fluctuations it doesn&amp;#39;t tell you again A1C does not tell you anything about fluctuations it only tells you what is your average so we want to avoid low blood sugars but still want to keep the avancy down that is the key that differentiates a good diabetes doctor from a bad one that differentiates a good endocrinologist from a bad one so if if you&amp;#39;re on medications that cause a lot of low blood sugars and you&amp;#39;re suffering from this and your doctors don&amp;#39;t care about that that is a problem right so uh do you need to you need to give them hypoglycemia the low blood sugar see how they how it feels you know so anyways uh so that&amp;#39;s the goal as low as reasonably achievable that if you&amp;#39;re going down to six percent and you&amp;#39;re having a lot of low blood sugars and we don&amp;#39;t have any way of improving that because you have to be on these medications for some reason then I tell them look it&amp;#39;s okay to be a 6.5 or it&amp;#39;s okay to be seven percent rather than having so many low blood sugars correct so I hope we agree on that some people are extremely obsessed about their blood sugars they their their their stock in the A1C or my A1C has to be six percent or whatever however they came up with these ideas uh they don&amp;#39;t even know sometimes what the A1C is but they want to see that number down to six it&amp;#39;s a psychological thing but I try to educate them look it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s not just about uh the number it&amp;#39;s about your health right so the reason we want to bring the A1C down we want to avoid complications uh but 6.5 percent also will not give you complications seven percent less than seven percent will probably not gonna give you complications so it is better to be safe than trying to pull the numbers too low sometimes there are actually studies where when they tried every medication it&amp;#39;s called a court study if you want to look it up it&amp;#39;s a major study a super large study so what they did they tried to bring A1C down as much as possible and they realized that more people actually died and they attribute that due to too many low blood sugars uh causing the death so as a result we want to avoid that problem so the problem with A1C as you can imagine so since you&amp;#39;re having low blood sugars and you&amp;#39;re having A1C down so that is one of the problems you really you know when you start using a Dexcom G6 or freestyle Libre for example that tells you all the fluctuations because it&amp;#39;s a continuous glucose measurement devices that tell you everything happening with your blood sugars you&amp;#39;ll be so surprised how much your blood sugars are actually fluctuating so as a result we want to make sure that does not happen so I&amp;#39;ll give you an example so you may have a seven percent Avon C right with blood sugars ranging between 130 and 180. that&amp;#39;s not actually bad if you&amp;#39;re waking up with 180 and your highest during the day is 180 you can still have a seven percent and that&amp;#39;s a healthy number because you&amp;#39;re not really fluctuating too much but you can achieve the same number again seven percent is what 150 on average right so 130 180 you know put them together divided by two that is seven percent now if you are having a blood sugar of 50 and 250 every time let&amp;#39;s say you&amp;#39;re 51 times 250 next time 51 times 250 next time and keeps going so you&amp;#39;re actually having a lot of very high blood sugars but because of the low blood sugars it negates it out as a result you slept seven percent A1C so just because you go to your primary care doctor and you&amp;#39;re A1C same person and they say oh you&amp;#39;re good that doesn&amp;#39;t necessarily mean you&amp;#39;re good you may still be having a lot of fluctuations and that still needs to be addressed so as a result it&amp;#39;s sugar MDS we monitor you and we track you remotely so if you are fluctuating that much we don&amp;#39;t wait three months if you don&amp;#39;t just check your A1C we look at your real numbers we try to get you continuous glucose monitoring devices we uh you know if you cannot get those we at least monitor your finger sticks remotely so if you are using our app I can see what&amp;#39;s going on on my screen without you even knowing so that is the video of it so we can intervene and fix those problems before it turns into bigger problems another quick tip for you to know Avon C may be different from Lab to lab so if you&amp;#39;re checking your advancing doctor&amp;#39;s office and then you go to um to another lab you may actually end up having like let&amp;#39;s say one time you check is 6.8 next time it can be 7.1 and you&amp;#39;ll be like oh well it went up actually it&amp;#39;s just a variation in the labs so I would recommend to stick with the same lab because Avon C basically helps us the most to see the trend so if you&amp;#39;re going down from nine percent down to eight percent seven percent that&amp;#39;s a good sign although again it doesn&amp;#39;t tell you the whole story but it&amp;#39;s still pretty good sign okay now what other disadvantages now sometimes actually not appropriate so again remember we rely on your hemoglobin so if you have anemia which is a hemoglobin problem right so if you have iron deficiency B12 deficiency or you have chronic kidney disease and they are giving you erythropoietin anything that that messes with your hemoglobins you may be having transfusion you know you may be having bleedings you may be having iron infusions anything that tries to manage plate your anemia your your hemoglobin cells can definitely distort the overall result because you are basically adding when you are transfusing you&amp;#39;re adding fresh cells you&amp;#39;re you know diluting the pool uh or if you have an anemia your your hemoglobins may actually die faster so as a result it doesn&amp;#39;t really reflect the three months so some in some diseases they actually live longer and it does you know it can over reflect so if there is a hemoglobin problem if you have thalassemia if you have sickle cell disease then the hemoglobin A1c is really not very reliable so that is something that you should know about so what do we do if we cannot use hemoglobination number one we can use continuous glucose monitoring systems and they are the best so even if you don&amp;#39;t have a personal CGM uh like a Dexcom G6 or freestyle Libre we can do a professional one we can put one on you for a week or two to see how your sugars are really running instead of just A1C also we have other testing such as fructosamine again that lines the glucose so we rely on the fructosamine&amp;#39;s ability to bind the glucose which gives us a shorter duration around two to three weeks time frame of how your blood sugar is on average running so that can we can use that we can use glyco Mark if you&amp;#39;re not on Jordans farsig or Invokana that certain medications that actually makes you urinate the blood sugar glyco Mark is a test that relies on the kidneys ability to reabsorb glucose and so forth so we can use glyco Mark as an alternative test so we have other ways to find out how your sugars are running and most importantly if you have nothing else to do you have your finger sticks you can do blood sugar checks and if you are checking frequently enough that can give you a almost like a good enough uh understanding of how your blood sugars are running as well sometimes pregnant women with gestational diabetes also are curious if they can just rely on A1C it is it is still used however remember when you&amp;#39;re pregnant your blood volume goes up your hemoglobin changes so it may be a little falsely low but if you know that it&amp;#39;s falsely low and you can you can you still have to check your finger sticks you should still be okay you can still look at the hemoglobin as a way of controlling diabetes during pregnancy but again just you have to be careful because the results are not exactly the same as if when you are not pregnant again guys thank you for watching uh if you like it please give a thumbs up and subscribe to the channel so we are sending videos a couple videos every week For Your Entertainment and education uh please support us and remember uh sugar MDS is a channel uh it&amp;#39;s a website we basically provide remote Diabetes Care we have an office in West Palm Beach that if you need to be seen physically we do see patients physically but we recommend actually avoiding to go to the doctor for our purposes because we can actually do everything remotely without the physical limitation and we can stay in touch through texting emailing and so forth so that&amp;#39;s a concierge service covered by the insurance just just take advantage of it see you later [Music]",

    "transcript": "now that&amp;#39;s an ulcer so today I&amp;#39;m going to talk to you about diabetic foot ulcers hey Dr John here this is probably the most common foot wound or you know problem we see with our diabetic patients is a diabetic foot ulcer and what&amp;#39;s the reason why diabetics get this well diabetes can cause neuropathy and if a diabetic patient&amp;#39;s not controlled well enough it can cause a breakdown in the skin and what happens is is that in an area underneath the foot you can have a heavy callous buildup due to uneven pressures and those uneven pressures causing this constant callous buildup will eventually break down the underlying tissues and what&amp;#39;s the problem with a diabetic foot ulcer well the diabetic foot ulcer can lead to an infection of the soft tissue infection of the bone and eventually an amputation and so the goal as podiatrists Foot and Ankle Specialist is to get this wound healed as quickly as possible to prevent that that is what we call diabetic limb Salvage and this is probably the most important thing we as foot Specialists can do for our patients with diabetes is to avoid amputations which is a epidemic in really in the world considering the onset of diabetes and the constant uh you know risks involved with amputation so here I&amp;#39;m really just trying to remove as much of this heavy buildup of callus it&amp;#39;s fibrous tissue this is non-viable or non-living tissue that doesn&amp;#39;t have any blood flow to it at all so all of this has to go because if it doesn&amp;#39;t get debrided or shaved off like I&amp;#39;m doing here it will just promote further breakdown of the tissue and actually promote infection and so taking you know the 15 blade here I&amp;#39;m further shaving down all this callous tissue because I want this wound to have the best optimal chance of healing so after we remove this callus and this fibrotic you know tissue the goal is to really get this wound offloaded which means we want to remove as much of that pressure underneath this big toe joint and I&amp;#39;ll put her in a surgical offloading shoe which will essentially float that area of the ulcer that will help the tissues relieve a lot of the stress that has been causing the breakdown of the uh the tissue underneath there as you can see I&amp;#39;m trying to make sure that this hole or this deep ulcer part is not going in any further because if it starts to track or go deeper into the bone that&amp;#39;s a big sign that&amp;#39;s getting really bad you can already see a little bit of redness around the ulcer and so we want to make sure that there is no infection or if there is some type of bacteria causing this wound to keep from healing then we&amp;#39;ll need to make sure of what that is and I&amp;#39;ll be taking a wound culture here but the main goal is she has to have her diabetes under control if her diabetes is under not under control this wound will not heal so as podiatrists we work closely with our primary care doctors our diabetic endocrinologist doctors to make sure that one her hemoglobin A1c is low her diabetes is in check and that will give us the optimal amount of healing also her circulation is very important so here we&amp;#39;re taking a wound culture so it&amp;#39;s a swab and this is a sterile swab making sure I can get into every little crevice there as possible so we can get a really good reading and we&amp;#39;ll send this off to the lab the lab will give us back an idea of what bacteria might be in this wound and then we can put on appropriate antibiotics so what are the goals to Healing we want a regular debridement of the wound we want to offload the ulcer she&amp;#39;s got to get her diabetes in control and if there&amp;#39;s any infection after the wound culture comes back we have to get rid of that we have to treat that infection hope you enjoyed that oh but wait there&amp;#39;s an update three months later this is her foot completely healed she&amp;#39;s doing great she&amp;#39;s coming in every six months for preventive care and she&amp;#39;s happy hey make sure you subscribe hit that Bell icon and look for more videos I appreciate your loyalty we&amp;#39;ll see you next time [Music]",

day it&amp;#39;s kind of obviously realized something wasn&amp;#39;t right in hurling I I have a national title when I was under 14 in boxing I have a national title as well when I was 13 I think dender was my my last resort um I came up as a midfielder went to strike Winger then um ended up as a Defender really um so yeah the go was always kind of my thing so I like as well as defending the box I like to to get a few in the other box as well so I grew up in in y so is just where I kind of came up from my hometown and started playing football when I was 5 six really just going to join the local club and played football all my mates and kind of yeah went from there really this was just where I grew up where all my friends were all my family were um it&amp;#39;s kind of a summer town next near the beach in summer it&amp;#39;s Grace when it&amp;#39;s good weather then I suppose just where I grew up really went to school until I was I suppose yeah 19 so I have two younger brothers

boxing I was 14 um and then yeah I supposed the age around 14 I kind of thought it was time for me to kind of focus on just playing football um and just that was the only sport I was doing since then growing up I I wasn&amp;#39;t even sure which one I wanted to do because I love them all uh so much probably from the youngest age I was probably more into hurling probably just cuz I think it&amp;#39;s probably the biggest sporty in Ireland know in hling I I have a national title when I was under 14 in boxing of a national title as well when I was 13 and then I kind of just started finding myself enjoying playing football more so um than the other sports and wanted to focus on that um and then a few nitions with the the soccer grown up as well um from the age of about 11 till 15 I think the vendor was my my last resort um I came up as a midfielder went a striker Winger then um ended up as a Defender really um so yeah the gos was always kind of my thing as a striker and then as well as defending the box I like to to get a few in the other box as well I think I was midsized I suppose till I was about 16 and then um kind of just got a few growth Sports and from about 16 to 18 19 I kind of just grew a lot really um upwards and yeah just kind of went from there really I was diagn was a type 1 diabetes and I was 16 um I think it was just there was a few weeks um around March time where I was just kind of ill I was losing a lot of weight um was very tired I was drinking maybe 8 n liters of water a day it&amp;#39;s kind of obviously uh realized something wasn&amp;#39;t right um went to the doctors and they kind of just sent me up the hospital and kind of diagnosed me with it my prankers basically doesn&amp;#39;t work um doesn&amp;#39;t produce insulin so it&amp;#39;s just kind of a a genetic thing I suppose but in that sense no one in my family has ever had it so I was probably the first one to get it I suppose it&amp;#39;s not the most positive thing but for me I think it was positive CU since I was diagnosed with a 16 is when things kind of started to click for me in size of getting physically bigger um fitter and just I think since having it I&amp;#39;ve kind of progressed through the ranks in football quicker um and it&amp;#39;s just being a positive thing for me I think some people kind of over complicated didn&amp;#39;t think you can&amp;#39;t eat this you can&amp;#39;t eat that but I can eat everything I can do everything that everyone else can but I think um it&amp;#39;s just counting the carbohydrates in the food I eat and then based on on that how much I eat is how much I&amp;#39;d inject insulin into my body because I suppose for you it just kind of naturally does it your body you just um but for me I have to kind of calculate it and sometimes it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s not perfect and it is time consuming sometimes but um it&amp;#39;s something you get used to I do a lot of it by myself I like to do it myself but yeah I mean they&amp;#39;re all at hand if if I do need support or help but um no I like to do it by myself I know not sure that was at real before I had it well it still has it you can&amp;#39;t get rid of it but um there is a few players but not many that I suppose might have come out saying they have it or um I don&amp;#39;t think there&amp;#39;s anyone in the Premier League that has it so it could be the first or one of the first in a while anyway um so I suppose it&amp;#39;s rare in that sense as approach is it&amp;#39;s cool I suppose but um it probably will become a bit more a lot more people will start getting it I think and we&amp;#39;ll have and probably come out about it as well I think when they first find out it&amp;#39;s kind of a all up in there I can&amp;#39;t do this can&amp;#39;t do that but you can I suppose you can do anything any other any other player is doing um you just have to look after your body more and in a sense you kind of know what goes into your body and how it affects your body so it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s good enough sense um I&amp;#39;m kind of I suppose just more in touch with my body how it feels um and I suppose the worst part is time consuming but it&amp;#39;s um it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s not bad at all I mean you get used to it and um you can do anything any other player can do as well so I think uh the first step for me was joining Cork City um Academy when I was under 17 U so that was kind of the first big move for me um done into three years there and kind of progressed into the the first team kind of just came in through injury and played then the second half of the Season played 12 games um and then at the end of the season offered a few trials over in England and I went over to Crystal Palace on a twoe trial and they offered to sign me on a on a loan to buy option and then after 3 weeks of being there they bought me um kind of yeah I went over there it was during the co kind of scene and um yeah kind of just rest through there really I wanted to just try something different I was open-minded when when the move came about was I suppose optimistic at the start with the the Belgian move and moving country again and different culture and everything but I mean after only being there a few weeks um I was really enjoying it um the club was great I&amp;#39;m Ming back and um know I didn&amp;#39;t look back um I suppose just the the language probably the the main thing um living in another another City uh I suppose we don&amp;#39;t speak that language and you&amp;#39;re kind of just getting used to uh your surroundings um and being in another country again but uh know all the people there were really helpful and um that was a great season so obviously after this season um kind of got the had a few I knew I was going to be leaving Palace cuz I knew I wanted to move on and um the move to Leon kind of came about and it was it was a huge Club when it came in and um I kind of just thought like I already been to Belgium and it would be something similar in the language and everything um it&amp;#39;s a huge Club so I kind of just I jumped at it really I knew comeing here I&amp;#39;d have to to be patient I know um like the other clubs I&amp;#39;ve been at being patient is is something that&amp;#39;s all part of it and then once I get my chance um hopefully I grab with two arms and go from there the Premier League is the best league in the world um the pace of the game the physicality um I know I haven&amp;#39;t played much of it but you can just see from the line that I suppose it is very fast and it&amp;#39;s a great league and has great players so um that&amp;#39;s supp the quicker I come in there uh the more I look forward to it all the lads are at top uh no complaints about anyone um but you can you can see that it&amp;#39;s a Clos group um everyone&amp;#39;s made and yeah no Sheamus um I suppose he was going to on to me before coming here about coming here and uh he&amp;#39;s been right it is a really good group of lads um and you can see that the club is I suppose um family kind of family feeli to it everyone was very close and um that&amp;#39;s just suppos is a great club and everything that Sheamus said [Applause]",

    "transcript": "everyone in this video i will tell you about 12 of the best foods for diabetics so let&amp;#39;s start with the number one that is whole grain the examples of whole grain include brown rice bulgur wheat buckwheat oats barley and quinoa whole grains are rich in fiber and nutrients as compared to the refined white grains fibers slow down the digestive process so whatever we eat is digested a bit slower thus the nutrients are absorbed by the body at a lower pace and does it prevents sudden spike in blood sugar level it will also keep you full for a longer duration whole grains have a lower glycemic index thus they have comparatively less impact on blood sugar levels now glycemic index means the amount of sugar that would be raised by a particular food so the foods that have lower glycemic index will raise your blood sugar to a lower extent whole grains in our diet instead of refined grains may reduce the risk of diabetes mellitus next is green leafy vegetables some examples of green leafy vegetables include spinach and kale so the green leafy vegetables are a rich source of nutrients and they are low in calories they are also low in digestible carbohydrates so the carbohydrates that are present in these are not easily absorbed by the body they are rich in dietary fibers phytochemicals and vitamins including the vitamin c and minerals this vitamin c has a potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory property thus it helps reduce cellular damage and it also promotes heart health and eye health let&amp;#39;s now go to nuts consuming nuts along with a controlled diet this can help in improving blood sugar level in type 2 diabetes patients these may also help reduce inflammation they also help lower blood sugar and hba1c so what is hba1c it is a marker for long term blood sugar control it also lowers ldl and ldl is the bad cholesterol the tree nuts that is walnut almond hazelnut and pistachios also help people with diabetes to improve their heart health for example pistachio contains glucagon like peptide and this reduces glucose levels thus it reduces the risk of diabetes next is greek yogurt greek yogurt is rich in protein calcium and probiotics it is low in carbohydrates one serving of greek yogurt contains only 6 to 8 grams of carbohydrate which is even lower than the conventional yogurt it has a special type of fat called conjugated linoleic acid and this may help keep you full for longer so just like fibers the cla or the conjugated linoleic acid also keeps you full for a longer duration so you will eat less and thus the blood sugar rise would be controlled it has a low glycemic index so they are again beneficial next is garlic garlic is rich in manganese vitamin b6 vitamin c selenium and fibers so consumption of garlic improves glycemic status garlic also helps lower blood sugar inflammation ldl cholesterol which as i have said is the bad cholesterol and blood pressure in people with diabetes next is cinnamon cinnamon enhances the release of insulin it also enhances signaling of insulin receptors thus it helps in the management of diabetes it is also a powerful antioxidant so it prevents the development of diabetes cinnamon also prevents a sudden rise in sugar level after meals so it is beneficial for patients with diabetes next is apple cider vinegar so apple cider vinegar is made by fermenting the apple juice so what happens here is that the sugar in the apple juice is converted to acetic acid so apart from acetic acid it also contains vitamin c and vitamin b the apple cider vinegar is also known to improve the function of insulin so it effectively reduces blood glucose levels next up is beans beans are rich in vitamin b minerals that is calcium magnesium and potassium it is also a rich source of fibers the fibers and the proteins keep us full for a longer duration and thus they will reduce our carbohydrate intake the beans also have a low glycemic index so glycemic index of a few beans for example soya bean is 15 kidney beans is 28 and chickpeas is around 33 so anything below 50 is considered as a low glycemic index so these are all beneficial next are berries so berries like blueberries strawberries are all powerful antioxidants they also contain polyphenols vitamin c and fibers so the polyphenol may improve insulin sensitivity in adults so this will help us lower the blood glucose level berries also have a low glycemic index next are eggs regular egg consumption may reduce your heart disease risk in several ways so the eggs may decrease inflammation they improve insulin sensitivity and they also help increase the hdl that is your good cholesterol levels hence they may reduce the risk of heart disease and diabetes a 2019 study found that eating a high fat low carbohydrate breakfast of eggs could help people with diabetes manage blood sugar levels throughout the day so the eggs promote good blood sugar management and they also promote eye health next is broccoli broccoli is one of the most nutritious vegetables and broccoli is low in calories and digestible carbs so it will help keep your blood sugar low it also has important nutrients like vitamin c and magnesium consuming broccoli sprouts may lead to a reduction in blood glucose in people with diabetes this reduction in blood glucose level is likely due to the sulforaphane this is a chemical which is found in cruciferous vegetables for example broccoli and sprouts the last one is fatty fish the examples of fatty fish include salmon herring sardines and mackerel and these are all rich source of omega-3 fatty acid dha and epa so the omega-3 fatty acid dha and epa these are all good for the health of heart the dha and epa specifically are important as they reduce inflammation thus they protect the cells that line your blood vessels and may help lower the risk of atherosclerosis so various researchers have indicated that eating fatty fish regularly may lower the risk of acute coronary syndromes for example heart attacks and the fatty fishes also help regulate blood sugar the fatty fishes are rich in protein which makes you feel full for a longer duration and this will reduce your carbohydrate consumption so these were the few good foods for diabetics that&amp;#39;s all for now i hope you like this video and if you do like this video please like comment and share

    "transcript": "hello guys today we are going to talk about A1C so what is A1C this commonly asked question and today I&amp;#39;m specifically answering Barbara Williamson&amp;#39;s question where she asked in our what is normal blood sugar video and I think I mentioned A1C in that video and she&amp;#39;s asking what is really Avon C and everybody asking the same question so let&amp;#39;s talk about it I am Dr Ahmed arrogen I am the founder of sugarmds.com again our primary purpose is to serve you remotely so we can take care of your diabetes using technology uh not that you have to be tech savvy but we will make it easy for you where you don&amp;#39;t have to leave your home and you can still see us and make sure your diabetes under control and reduce the number of medications now let&amp;#39;s move on to the topic so why we measure A1C right so A1C is a test that&amp;#39;s commonly used is a standardized test so but most people have trouble understanding what the Avon C is so why do we call it A1C or hemoglobin A1c in a better term because we are measuring the glucose within your hemoglobin now hemoglobin is a protein in your blood that is subject to carry your oxygen from A to B so your your hemoglobin is getting oxygenated in your lungs and carrying that oxygen to the rest of the body now the same hemoglobin is permeable which means that it is open to the transfusion of glucose into itself so it opens its arms to the glucose so as a result the more glucose you have in your system the more glucose will be in your hemoglobin so that&amp;#39;s what we are measuring now why do we measure that every three months that&amp;#39;s the next question right so that is because your hemoglobin lives for three months so as a result assuming that your hemoglobins are living three months the glucose they accumulate in three months will be tested and then we can tell exactly how much your blood sugars are running based on how much glucose is in the hemoglobin there is a percentage it&amp;#39;s reported as a percentage and every percentage corresponds to an average blood sugar it is a perfect test barely but we&amp;#39;ll talk about the advantages and disadvantages of this test now so before we dive into details let&amp;#39;s talk about what do the results mean so sometimes I tell people okay your A1C is seven percent or they&amp;#39;ll tell that their A1C is six percent eight percent ten percent whatever when I ask my patients okay what does that mean to you and they say oh I think it&amp;#39;s supposed to be less than seven let&amp;#39;s suppose to be less than 6.5 they don&amp;#39;t they don&amp;#39;t really know what it means right so as an educated patient which is the best patient right so if you know what A1C is at the end of this video you&amp;#39;re going to be an Avon c pro you&amp;#39;re going to be able to teach everybody about A1C but the bottom line at least you should understand if nothing else from this video that every percentage in Avon C corresponds to an average blood sugar so six percent is on average 120 right so seven percent is 150. so every one percent increase or the decrease in your blood sugars corresponds to to a 30 milligram per deciliter change in your in your overall blood sugars so if you&amp;#39;re going from six percent to seven percent that means that your average blood sugars are Rising by 30 milligram per deciliter on average so six percent is 120 7 is 150 8 is 180 and then it goes on so if you go to like uh for example I want to calculate I&amp;#39;m going to cheat here so if you go look 12 percent that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s around three three hundred so but you can make an easy calculation about that so I hope that&amp;#39;s easy to understand and we&amp;#39;ll move on to the next topic now a lot of people are also confused about their Avon seagull right there&amp;#39;s a lot of things said and done about this Avon C uh now of course uh clinicians actually determine the Avon seagull the universal goal is less than seven percent and the reason there&amp;#39;s a universal goal is because they use Avon C in studies to determine the risk reduction so for example if your A1C goes down one percent you&amp;#39;re actually overall risk of diabetic complications can go down by 30 percent so as a result they determined that if you stay below seven percent overall for the entire population that is a good Target to keep patients with diabetes under control now of course the lower the sugar the better um so we want to keep actually young diabetics who just got diagnosed in the first five eight years of diabetes or even 10 years we want to keep them as low as possible less than 6.5 down to six percent that&amp;#39;s all okay I have a lot of patience with Avon C down to 5.7 5.5 not even in the diabetic range because of the approaches we have and they almost live their life almost free of diabetes right so that is possible so what I say to my patients with the A1C goal is as low as reasonably achievable what does it mean to bring the Avon C you have to bring your average blood sugars down right so to do that you have to use sometimes strong medications and some medications can cause very low blood sugars I know if you ever had a low blood sugar but it&amp;#39;s not a pleasant experience it is very very difficult to go through that experience now if you&amp;#39;re having low blood sugars frequently yes your A1C will go down right why because your average blood sugar will go down because you&amp;#39;re if you&amp;#39;re running low frequently your average will be low as well but that&amp;#39;s not what we want that&amp;#39;s one of the downside of Avon C is that just because your A1C is down doesn&amp;#39;t mean that you are doing great you may still be having a lot of fluctuations it doesn&amp;#39;t tell you again A1C does not tell you anything about fluctuations it only tells you what is your average so we want to avoid low blood sugars but still want to keep the avancy down that is the key that differentiates a good diabetes doctor from a bad one that differentiates a good endocrinologist from a bad one so if if you&amp;#39;re on medications that cause a lot of low blood sugars and you&amp;#39;re suffering from this and your doctors don&amp;#39;t care about that that is a problem right so uh do you need to you need to give them hypoglycemia the low blood sugar see how they how it feels you know so anyways uh so that&amp;#39;s the goal as low as reasonably achievable that if you&amp;#39;re going down to six percent and you&amp;#39;re having a lot of low blood sugars and we don&amp;#39;t have any way of improving that because you have to be on these medications for some reason then I tell them look it&amp;#39;s okay to be a 6.5 or it&amp;#39;s okay to be seven percent rather than having so many low blood sugars correct so I hope we agree on that some people are extremely obsessed about their blood sugars they their their their stock in the A1C or my A1C has to be six percent or whatever however they came up with these ideas uh they don&amp;#39;t even know sometimes what the A1C is but they want to see that number down to six it&amp;#39;s a psychological thing but I try to educate them look it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s not just about uh the number it&amp;#39;s about your health right so the reason we want to bring the A1C down we want to avoid complications uh but 6.5 percent also will not give you complications seven percent less than seven percent will probably not gonna give you complications so it is better to be safe than trying to pull the numbers too low sometimes there are actually studies where when they tried every medication it&amp;#39;s called a court study if you want to look it up it&amp;#39;s a major study a super large study so what they did they tried to bring A1C down as much as possible and they realized that more people actually died and they attribute that due to too many low blood sugars uh causing the death so as a result we want to avoid that problem so the problem with A1C as you can imagine so since you&amp;#39;re having low blood sugars and you&amp;#39;re having A1C down so that is one of the problems you really you know when you start using a Dexcom G6 or freestyle Libre for example that tells you all the fluctuations because it&amp;#39;s a continuous glucose measurement devices that tell you everything happening with your blood sugars you&amp;#39;ll be so surprised how much your blood sugars are actually fluctuating so as a result we want to make sure that does not happen so I&amp;#39;ll give you an example so you may have a seven percent Avon C right with blood sugars ranging between 130 and 180. that&amp;#39;s not actually bad if you&amp;#39;re waking up with 180 and your highest during the day is 180 you can still have a seven percent and that&amp;#39;s a healthy number because you&amp;#39;re not really fluctuating too much but you can achieve the same number again seven percent is what 150 on average right so 130 180 you know put them together divided by two that is seven percent now if you are having a blood sugar of 50 and 250 every time let&amp;#39;s say you&amp;#39;re 51 times 250 next time 51 times 250 next time and keeps going so you&amp;#39;re actually having a lot of very high blood sugars but because of the low blood sugars it negates it out as a result you slept seven percent A1C so just because you go to your primary care doctor and you&amp;#39;re A1C same person and they say oh you&amp;#39;re good that doesn&amp;#39;t necessarily mean you&amp;#39;re good you may still be having a lot of fluctuations and that still needs to be addressed so as a result it&amp;#39;s sugar MDS we monitor you and we track you remotely so if you are fluctuating that much we don&amp;#39;t wait three months if you don&amp;#39;t just check your A1C we look at your real numbers we try to get you continuous glucose monitoring devices we uh you know if you cannot get those we at least monitor your finger sticks remotely so if you are using our app I can see what&amp;#39;s going on on my screen without you even knowing so that is the video of it so we can intervene and fix those problems before it turns into bigger problems another quick tip for you to know Avon C may be different from Lab to lab so if you&amp;#39;re checking your advancing doctor&amp;#39;s office and then you go to um to another lab you may actually end up having like let&amp;#39;s say one time you check is 6.8 next time it can be 7.1 and you&amp;#39;ll be like oh well it went up actually it&amp;#39;s just a variation in the labs so I would recommend to stick with the same lab because Avon C basically helps us the most to see the trend so if you&amp;#39;re going down from nine percent down to eight percent seven percent that&amp;#39;s a good sign although again it doesn&amp;#39;t tell you the whole story but it&amp;#39;s still pretty good sign okay now what other disadvantages now sometimes actually not appropriate so again remember we rely on your hemoglobin so if you have anemia which is a hemoglobin problem right so if you have iron deficiency B12 deficiency or you have chronic kidney disease and they are giving you erythropoietin anything that that messes with your hemoglobins you may be having transfusion you know you may be having bleedings you may be having iron infusions anything that tries to manage plate your anemia your your hemoglobin cells can definitely distort the overall result because you are basically adding when you are transfusing you&amp;#39;re adding fresh cells you&amp;#39;re you know diluting the pool uh or if you have an anemia your your hemoglobins may actually die faster so as a result it doesn&amp;#39;t really reflect the three months so some in some diseases they actually live longer and it does you know it can over reflect so if there is a hemoglobin problem if you have thalassemia if you have sickle cell disease then the hemoglobin A1c is really not very reliable so that is something that you should know about so what do we do if we cannot use hemoglobination number one we can use continuous glucose monitoring systems and they are the best so even if you don&amp;#39;t have a personal CGM uh like a Dexcom G6 or freestyle Libre we can do a professional one we can put one on you for a week or two to see how your sugars are really running instead of just A1C also we have other testing such as fructosamine again that lines the glucose so we rely on the fructosamine&amp;#39;s ability to bind the glucose which gives us a shorter duration around two to three weeks time frame of how your blood sugar is on average running so that can we can use that we can use glyco Mark if you&amp;#39;re not on Jordans farsig or Invokana that certain medications that actually makes you urinate the blood sugar glyco Mark is a test that relies on the kidneys ability to reabsorb glucose and so forth so we can use glyco Mark as an alternative test so we have other ways to find out how your sugars are running and most importantly if you have nothing else to do you have your finger sticks you can do blood sugar checks and if you are checking frequently enough that can give you a almost like a good enough uh understanding of how your blood sugars are running as well sometimes pregnant women with gestational diabetes also are curious if they can just rely on A1C it is it is still used however remember when you&amp;#39;re pregnant your blood volume goes up your hemoglobin changes so it may be a little falsely low but if you know that it&amp;#39;s falsely low and you can you can you still have to check your finger sticks you should still be okay you can still look at the hemoglobin as a way of controlling diabetes during pregnancy but again just you have to be careful because the results are not exactly the same as if when you are not pregnant again guys thank you for watching uh if you like it please give a thumbs up and subscribe to the channel so we are sending videos a couple videos every week For Your Entertainment and education uh please support us and remember uh sugar MDS is a channel uh it&amp;#39;s a website we basically provide remote Diabetes Care we have an office in West Palm Beach that if you need to be seen physically we do see patients physically but we recommend actually avoiding to go to the doctor for our purposes because we can actually do everything remotely without the physical limitation and we can stay in touch through texting emailing and so forth so that&amp;#39;s a concierge service covered by the insurance just just take advantage of it see you later [Music]",

    "transcript": "well hey guys if you are new here i&amp;#39;m a board-certified dermatologist and in this video i&amp;#39;m going to be going over 17 ways in which having diabetes can impact your skin diabetes is really common it is a group of disorders characterized by high blood sugar and disturbances and carbohydrate and lipid metabolism all right number one is acanthosis [ __ ] cans this is a skin condition where you have dark velvety plaques on the sides of the neck under the armpits can happen over your knuckles and the sides of the face and it is a marker of insulin resistance which occurs in diabetes it can precede the onset of diabetes and it&amp;#39;s thought to be due to insulin levels binding to receptors in the skin cells and a lot of people think that it&amp;#39;s either hyperpigmentation but it&amp;#39;s really just skin thickening and in some cases it can improve when the diabetes is under better control but for others it does persist topical treatments may help improve it but for the most part they really only minimize the appearance it still persists i have a video all about this condition so if you&amp;#39;re dealing with it i&amp;#39;m going to link it down below in the description box if you want to learn more number two you can turn yellow it&amp;#39;s called keratinemia and it&amp;#39;s diffuse yellow orange discoloration of the skin it may be due to a deficiency and conversion of carotene to vitamin a leading to build up of this yellowish pigment in the skin and it may also be due to a combination of that plus the collagen in our skin gets changed by the high levels of sugar in the blood and that combination can lead to yellowing of the skin number three is a hallmark finding of diabetes and that is called diabetic dermopathy otherwise known as shin spots because it happens on the shins these little round oval sores that have a dark brown rim around them they are brought about after maybe you whack your shin they&amp;#39;re secondary to trauma but they persist due to poor healing which occurs in diabetes number four diabetic thick skin this is actually pretty common with long-standing diabetes it&amp;#39;s a result of the elevation and blood glucose changing the collagen and the deeper layers of the skin it can cause swelling of the collagen and that can cause thickening and stiffness of the skin and what happens is the fingers lose the ability to straighten it starts with a pinky finger and then it begins to affect the fingers moving all the way to the thumb and that inability to straighten the fingers due to thickening of the skin is called the prayer sign because when you put your hands together you cannot put the palms together because the skin is so thickened and tightened number five is similarly related it is a condition called sclera edema basically thickening and diffuse redness on the back upper back and the neck and this has to do with swelling of the collagen in the deeper layers of the skin in that area it almost looks like you got a sunburn up there the skin is very thick now number six is not always due to diabetes but in the vast majority of cases of this condition it is associated with diabetes and that is this condition called necrobiosis lipoitica this starts out as little bumps on the shins that expand with time that can expand and then an ulcer can form now on the shins not only do you have poor circulation there because of the nature of the anatomy of the blood vessels but with diabetes you have even worse circulation so it&amp;#39;s a set up for poor healing this condition can be really hard to treat and can be a source of significant morbidity for patients because the skin does break down it can be treated with steroid injections and it also can be treated with aspirin pentoxyphylene now these medications and treatments they offer some benefit but in many cases the condition persists now i mentioned at the beginning of the video that diabetes is a disease in which there is a disruption in the metabolism of both carbohydrates and lipids diabetics tend to have high triglycerides that is a type of fat in the blood and one skin manifestation that can occur in diabetes is something called eruptive xanthomas these are the sudden onset of crops of firm yellow bumps that have a red rim this is a reflection of high triglycerides now unfortunately when the diabetes is treated and under better control this will remit now you can see eruptive xanthomas and patients taking medications that raise their triglycerides too high as an adverse effect so it&amp;#39;s not exclusive to diabetes but it certainly is something that we see in diabetics a fair amount as a result of elevation in triglyceride levels number eight remains a mystery and that is something called diabetic bullet bullet is a medical term for blisters the blisters most commonly affect the the hands and the feet they range in size anywhere from a few millimeters all the way to centimeters it&amp;#39;s thought that diabetic bullet or blisters in diabetic patients may be a manifestation or secondary to the neuropathy that diabetics develop so neuropathy is basically nerve damage to the nerves in the skin the periphery can cause numbness and tingling in the hands and feet poor healing abnormalities and kind of sweating and one manifestation of that neuropathy may be these diabetic bully which are big blisters in diabetes you have damage to both the small and large blood vessels and blood vessels and circulation throughout the skin is key to skin health and when that is impaired you can actually have death of the skin dry gangrene most commonly affects the hands and the feet like the toes now because of the neuropathy diabetics have poor sensation in their fingers and toes the skin doesn&amp;#39;t heal well and they have blood vessel injury from their disease so that is a set up for the formation of ulcers on the fingers and toes sores that really can become infected and serve as an entry point for infectious microorganisms so definitely a source of morbidity to diabetics speaking of hands and feet oddly enough many diabetics develop redness over the hands and feet and this is thought to be due to abnormalities and how the blood vessels dilate there but they can have persistent redness the extremities often are very cool and sensate you know they don&amp;#39;t heat up well just due to poor circulation number 11 is actually going to be your nails so diabetics because they have poor circulation and neuropathy that ends up impacting the health of the nails and you get what&amp;#39;s called nail dystrophy basically brittle thickened kind of crumbling nails that and cracking around the nail beds that unfortunately serves as a very hospitable environment for nail fungus so diabetics are prone to nail fungus number 12 is something called a perforating disorder it&amp;#39;s these bumps that have a rough what&amp;#39;s called a keratotic center and this is most often seen in diabetics with renal failure who are on dialysis why it happens we&amp;#39;re not entirely sure but uh it can be very itchy and more bumps come out with scratching and when you biopsy one of these bumps and look at it under the microscope the reason it&amp;#39;s called a perforating disorder is because what is in the center that keratotic rough bump in the center of the bump if you look at it under the microscope it&amp;#39;s actually collagen and elastin that is getting extruded out to the surface of the skin from the deeper layers of the skin so it&amp;#39;s you know something that we see in diabetics who have renal failure oftentimes on dialysis now i already talked to you guys about necrobiosis lipoitica how that happens on the shins most often and can ulcerate i talk to you guys about acryl gangrene on the hands and feet but another thing that is related to the neuropathy is the formation of ulcers that can happen on the lower legs but it can happen on the feet as well anywhere where you have chronic pressure the skin just breaks down and you have poor sensation there due to the neuropathy and that can be very very challenging to heal because again diabetics have very poor wound healing they often have to see a specialist to have these treated all right so diabetics they have poor healing poor circulation they get neuropathy and they have an impaired immune system and all of these things you know it leads to skin breakdown and makes them very very very prone to a wide variety of skin infections and one of the more common types of skin infections that diabetics get is candida it&amp;#39;s a yeast you know it causes yeast infections in women in the genital area it also can cause yeast infections of the genitalia in men uh it can cause a condition in the mouth on the corners of the mouth known as angular kelitis it can impact the tongue you can get a yeast infection of the tongue on the skin the nails it&amp;#39;s called a candidal paronychia now diabetics also can get a yeast infection in the web spaces between their fingers it&amp;#39;s called erosio interdigita blastomycetica eib it can cause little cracks in the skin allow for entry of other microorganisms put you at risk for you know a more severe type of infection but it&amp;#39;s a combination of poor circulation impaired immune and impaired immune system and an impaired skin barrier that really just makes diabetics quite prone to yeast infections number 15 another type of infection is going to be a bacterial skin infection and similarly to why diabetics are at risk for yeast infections they&amp;#39;re likewise at risk for a variety of bacterial infections staph bacteria that can cause impetigo it can cause folliculitis which is an infection of the hair follicle diabetics can get a type of skin infection called erythrosma this red painful rash due to a bacteria called carine bacterium pseudomonas is a bacteria that can infect the ear cause an ear infection but in diabetics because of their poor circulation their impaired immune system that bacteria can actually turn deadly in the ear it can get into the bone and actually get into the brain i mean it can be life-threatening number 16 is going to be fungal infections like ringworm toenail fungus foot fungus diabetics typically have typically have foot fungus or skin again it is it is a ripe for colonization of yeast bacteria and in this case what are called dermatophytes a type of skin fungus and last but not least number 17 being a diabetic you can have uh persistent facial redness you can have a red face it can also affect the neck and the upper chest this is called rubiosis not entirely sure why this happens but it is pretty common maybe due to you know the the microvascular disease that diabetics have fortunately it does typically improve when the diabetes is under better control all right you guys so those are 17 ways in which having diabetes can impact your skin you know diabetes it&amp;#39;s a serious medical condition regardless of the type that you have it is pretty serious it can can and does impact pretty much every organ system as i&amp;#39;ve said in all my videos your skin is a window to what is going on internally and you can see here how in the setting of diabetes with all of these underlying issues it really surfaces quite literally to the skin and there are a lot of clues going on to the patient&amp;#39;s underlying condition the severity of the disease the chronicity of it so if your doctor tells you that you have early diabetes or pre-diabetes insulin resistance please take it seriously i don&amp;#39;t think people really realize the potential for severity with this condition because it you know these things they don&amp;#39;t start appearing all at once but it can be the road that you&amp;#39;re going down if you don&amp;#39;t get it under control and dietary and lifestyle changes can make a difference for sure if you get that diagnosis from your doctor like hey i&amp;#39;m worried you know your sugars are hot something called the hemoglobin a1c definitely take it seriously you know it&amp;#39;s your life these are these are things that can show up if this gets out of hand and it certainly can and i&amp;#39;ve only scratched the surface here of some of the more common skin findings but we&amp;#39;re talking about diabetes i mean i already alluded to the neuropathy you can lose a limb that is not uncommon end-stage renal disease and diabetics having to be on dialysis um it&amp;#39;s a serious disease i would not wish this on anyone on and so if you if somebody had if your doctor has told you that they&amp;#39;re concerned that you have you know elevated blood glucose signs of early diabetes definitely do whatever you can to bring in whatever lifestyle factors you can&amp;#39;t exercising changing up your diet and and try and try and you know be proactive about it because this is the last thing that you want all right you guys i hope this video was informative and helpful if you liked it give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and as always don&amp;#39;t forget sunscreen and subscribe i&amp;#39;ll talk to you guys tomorrow bye [Music] you",

    "transcript": "hi I&amp;#39;m Dr Jason fun welcome to part three of the diabetes code Clinic where we&amp;#39;re focused on type 2 diabetes remission we&amp;#39;re trying to reverse the disease if you didn&amp;#39;t have a chance to review Parts one and two you can go back and have a look where we talked about what type 2 diabetes is and also an introduction to low carbohydrate diets today we&amp;#39;re going to continue talking about low carbohydrate diets [Music] remember that the disease of type 2 diabetes is your body having too much glucose which is a type of sugar imagine a barrel where you can put water in the water&amp;#39;s like that glucose and the barrels like your body it can store a certain amount of this glucose but when it&amp;#39;s full it&amp;#39;s going to spill over when it spills over you see it in the blood when you see the high blood glucose you get tired diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and where did that glucose come from it came from your diet so you got to look for the sources of sugar in your diet and get rid of it that&amp;#39;s why low carbohydrate diets can be so effective the key Point here is that some foods are going to raise your blood glucose and some foods don&amp;#39;t raise your blood glucose so you want to emphasize those foods that don&amp;#39;t raise your blood glucose ose and that&amp;#39;s done by cutting down your carbohydrates but what foods are high and what foods are low you can certainly test it yourself using a blood glucose monitor but you can also go to something called the glycemic index which has been used for decades and what the glycemic index is is a scale of how much a certain food on average is going to raise your blood glucose and it&amp;#39;s a scale of 0 to 100 100 being uh glucose which is the most that your blood glucose goes up in response to that food so zero is uh good 100 means that that food tends to maximum raise your blood glucose and this is done by measuring a whole lot of people and taking the average response but your own response may be different which is why it may be useful to personalize it there&amp;#39;s something else called the glycemic load which is also a very very useful concept because it takes into account both the glycemic index and how much a typical portion of food is because certain foods may have a very high glycemic index but a relatively low glycemic load because the typical portion just isn&amp;#39;t that big for example carrots have a fairly high glycemic index of 70 but the glycemic load is relatively low at four and this is why it&amp;#39;s important to take both of them into account and you can find these lists on the internet they&amp;#39;re fairly easy and they&amp;#39;re well accepted by anyone so if we look at this glycemic index of foods and you can look at these foods like chicken and butter and eggs and beef and you&amp;#39;ll notice those are mostly proteins and fats and therefore if you look at the gemic index it&amp;#39;s zero when you test large numbers of people no matter how much chicken you eat or eggs or butter the blood glucose on average goes up zero that&amp;#39;s great so if you&amp;#39;re eating a meal and you prioritize those Foods your blood glucose is not expected to go up at all and that&amp;#39;s because it&amp;#39;s really just carbohydrate containing foods that are going to raise your blood glucose because carbohydrates are sugar you eat the sugar your blood sugar goes up of the carbohydrates there&amp;#39;s still a very big difference between refined carbohydrates and natural carbohydrates those are the things that look like they do in nature so refined carbohydrates might be things such as Corn Flakes baguettes and so on a baguette doesn&amp;#39;t grow on a tree it doesn&amp;#39;t grow on the ground it has to be refined and when you refine these carbohydrates the glycemic index tends to be very high and the glycemic load tends to be very high because a lot of the refining makes it easier to digest and also tends to get rid of a lot of the fiber the proteins and the fats leaving a relatively concentrated pure form of carbohydrate therefore when you eat it the uh body can absorb it very quickly and you get this big spike of glucose if you look at the glycemia index of a cornflakes is very high at 85 and the baguette still very high at 95 and the glycemic load which takes into account the portion size is still very high around 45 to 55 now contrast them to Natural carbohydrates because people point out that for example cauliflowers and carrots they&amp;#39;re also carbohydrates and absolutely they are when you look at the carrot it glycemic index might be very high 70 to 85 if it&amp;#39;s cooked is a little bit higher but the glycemic load is down at four cauliflower has a low glycemic index of only 15 and even lower when you get to glycemic load of only 0.8 even foods that grow below the ground things such as sweet potatoes and beets which are starchy carbohydrates but they&amp;#39;re natural have a relatively high glycemic index 65 to 70 but again when you compare it to the glycemic load you see that the glycemic load is much lower it&amp;#39;s down at 11 and S compared to White rise which is has a glycemic load of 56 or a baguette which is 45 so natural carbohydrates and refined carbohydrates there is a big difference cutting down total carbohydrates certainly is effective but if you do have to eat some choose the natural whole unprocessed carbohydrate because it makes a big difference and it&amp;#39;s not just me saying that you can see this uh American Heart Association scientific statement which is just from 2022 and what they tell you is that very low carbohydrate diets compared to a more moderate carbohydrate diet yield greater decrease in A1C meaning your blood sugars aren&amp;#39;t average better people lose more weight and they use less diabetes medication well that&amp;#39;s great why wouldn&amp;#39;t Everybody follow this very low carbohydrate diet the American Diabetes Association in 2020 uh published their consensus guidelines for Nutrition Therapy and what they said is that reducing overall carbohydrate intake for individuals with diabetes has demonstrated the most evidence for improving glycemia which means that no these are not fad diets these low carbohydrate diets actually have the most scientific evidence more than any any other diet the low carbohydrate diet has demonstrated time and again in scientific studies to be the most important for reducing the blood sugars again not very difficult you don&amp;#39;t eat the sugars your blood sugars don&amp;#39;t go up and once again if you look at their uh guidance it says emphasize non-starchy vegetables get rid of the added sugars and the refined grains and chose Whole Foods and you see that reflected in the glycemic index and the glycemic load the carbs are sugar and eating carbs e is eating sugar which raises your blood sugars try to eat total carbohydrates of less than 50 grams per day the American Diabetes Association put in a pamphlet guiding people how to eat a very low carbohydrate diet there are foods that have zero carbohydrates traes and these are going to be great because they&amp;#39;re not going to raise your blood glucose that&amp;#39;s things like Meats beef lamb pork ve chicken poultry duck goose turkey chicken and then fish and shellfish as well uh tuna shellfish that kind of thing Foods uh that are very low in carbohydrates include leafy vegetables so arugula kale spinach Water Crest and if they&amp;#39;re less than 5 gram of carboh hydrate preserving you can really eat as much as you feel like all of these non-starchy and leafy vegetables are very low in carbohydrates and there&amp;#39;s lots to choose from bok choy bean sprouts cabbage carrots and all that kind of thing you should look at your plate and try and fill half of it with those leafy non-starchy vegetables and half of it with meats and proteins you can alter it according to your taste but again both of those things are either zero carbohydrate or very low in carbohydrates and there are ways to make it easier for yourself there are low carbohydrate starch Alternatives if you normally eat something on bread for example you could go with something such as a lettuce wrap you can do that with a burger instead of having the bun you just wrap it in lettuce many many places will do that for you for no additional cost you can do cauliflower crust you can do uh things such as uh zoodles which are the the spiralized noodles you can make cauliflower rice where they shape your cauliflower in the same of rice and it looks like it and there are also things such as conj noodles which is a type of uh noodle that actually has zero carboh hydrate it&amp;#39;s made of yams sometimes called shiraki or Miracle noodles what happens if your blood glucose goes down well that&amp;#39;s good that&amp;#39;s exactly what we&amp;#39;re trying to do but if you&amp;#39;re on medication it might go too low so you have to always Monitor and be careful then you know you&amp;#39;re being overmedicated and you need to talk to your doctor about reducing those medications but remember if you&amp;#39;re taking less medications and getting the same blood sugar it means that your diabetes your disease is actually getting better so those are the things to make it easy for yourself to follow a low carbohydrate diet I hope you learned something I&amp;#39;ll see you at the next video",

    "transcript": "well hey guys if you are new here i&amp;#39;m a board-certified dermatologist and in this video i&amp;#39;m going to be going over 17 ways in which having diabetes can impact your skin diabetes is really common it is a group of disorders characterized by high blood sugar and disturbances and carbohydrate and lipid metabolism all right number one is acanthosis [ __ ] cans this is a skin condition where you have dark velvety plaques on the sides of the neck under the armpits can happen over your knuckles and the sides of the face and it is a marker of insulin resistance which occurs in diabetes it can precede the onset of diabetes and it&amp;#39;s thought to be due to insulin levels binding to receptors in the skin cells and a lot of people think that it&amp;#39;s either hyperpigmentation but it&amp;#39;s really just skin thickening and in some cases it can improve when the diabetes is under better control but for others it does persist topical treatments may help improve it but for the most part they really only minimize the appearance it still persists i have a video all about this condition so if you&amp;#39;re dealing with it i&amp;#39;m going to link it down below in the description box if you want to learn more number two you can turn yellow it&amp;#39;s called keratinemia and it&amp;#39;s diffuse yellow orange discoloration of the skin it may be due to a deficiency and conversion of carotene to vitamin a leading to build up of this yellowish pigment in the skin and it may also be due to a combination of that plus the collagen in our skin gets changed by the high levels of sugar in the blood and that combination can lead to yellowing of the skin number three is a hallmark finding of diabetes and that is called diabetic dermopathy otherwise known as shin spots because it happens on the shins these little round oval sores that have a dark brown rim around them they are brought about after maybe you whack your shin they&amp;#39;re secondary to trauma but they persist due to poor healing which occurs in diabetes number four diabetic thick skin this is actually pretty common with long-standing diabetes it&amp;#39;s a result of the elevation and blood glucose changing the collagen and the deeper layers of the skin it can cause swelling of the collagen and that can cause thickening and stiffness of the skin and what happens is the fingers lose the ability to straighten it starts with a pinky finger and then it begins to affect the fingers moving all the way to the thumb and that inability to straighten the fingers due to thickening of the skin is called the prayer sign because when you put your hands together you cannot put the palms together because the skin is so thickened and tightened number five is similarly related it is a condition called sclera edema basically thickening and diffuse redness on the back upper back and the neck and this has to do with swelling of the collagen in the deeper layers of the skin in that area it almost looks like you got a sunburn up there the skin is very thick now number six is not always due to diabetes but in the vast majority of cases of this condition it is associated with diabetes and that is this condition called necrobiosis lipoitica this starts out as little bumps on the shins that expand with time that can expand and then an ulcer can form now on the shins not only do you have poor circulation there because of the nature of the anatomy of the blood vessels but with diabetes you have even worse circulation so it&amp;#39;s a set up for poor healing this condition can be really hard to treat and can be a source of significant morbidity for patients because the skin does break down it can be treated with steroid injections and it also can be treated with aspirin pentoxyphylene now these medications and treatments they offer some benefit but in many cases the condition persists now i mentioned at the beginning of the video that diabetes is a disease in which there is a disruption in the metabolism of both carbohydrates and lipids diabetics tend to have high triglycerides that is a type of fat in the blood and one skin manifestation that can occur in diabetes is something called eruptive xanthomas these are the sudden onset of crops of firm yellow bumps that have a red rim this is a reflection of high triglycerides now unfortunately when the diabetes is treated and under better control this will remit now you can see eruptive xanthomas and patients taking medications that raise their triglycerides too high as an adverse effect so it&amp;#39;s not exclusive to diabetes but it certainly is something that we see in diabetics a fair amount as a result of elevation in triglyceride levels number eight remains a mystery and that is something called diabetic bullet bullet is a medical term for blisters the blisters most commonly affect the the hands and the feet they range in size anywhere from a few millimeters all the way to centimeters it&amp;#39;s thought that diabetic bullet or blisters in diabetic patients may be a manifestation or secondary to the neuropathy that diabetics develop so neuropathy is basically nerve damage to the nerves in the skin the periphery can cause numbness and tingling in the hands and feet poor healing abnormalities and kind of sweating and one manifestation of that neuropathy may be these diabetic bully which are big blisters in diabetes you have damage to both the small and large blood vessels and blood vessels and circulation throughout the skin is key to skin health and when that is impaired you can actually have death of the skin dry gangrene most commonly affects the hands and the feet like the toes now because of the neuropathy diabetics have poor sensation in their fingers and toes the skin doesn&amp;#39;t heal well and they have blood vessel injury from their disease so that is a set up for the formation of ulcers on the fingers and toes sores that really can become infected and serve as an entry point for infectious microorganisms so definitely a source of morbidity to diabetics speaking of hands and feet oddly enough many diabetics develop redness over the hands and feet and this is thought to be due to abnormalities and how the blood vessels dilate there but they can have persistent redness the extremities often are very cool and sensate you know they don&amp;#39;t heat up well just due to poor circulation number 11 is actually going to be your nails so diabetics because they have poor circulation and neuropathy that ends up impacting the health of the nails and you get what&amp;#39;s called nail dystrophy basically brittle thickened kind of crumbling nails that and cracking around the nail beds that unfortunately serves as a very hospitable environment for nail fungus so diabetics are prone to nail fungus number 12 is something called a perforating disorder it&amp;#39;s these bumps that have a rough what&amp;#39;s called a keratotic center and this is most often seen in diabetics with renal failure who are on dialysis why it happens we&amp;#39;re not entirely sure but uh it can be very itchy and more bumps come out with scratching and when you biopsy one of these bumps and look at it under the microscope the reason it&amp;#39;s called a perforating disorder is because what is in the center that keratotic rough bump in the center of the bump if you look at it under the microscope it&amp;#39;s actually collagen and elastin that is getting extruded out to the surface of the skin from the deeper layers of the skin so it&amp;#39;s you know something that we see in diabetics who have renal failure oftentimes on dialysis now i already talked to you guys about necrobiosis lipoitica how that happens on the shins most often and can ulcerate i talk to you guys about acryl gangrene on the hands and feet but another thing that is related to the neuropathy is the formation of ulcers that can happen on the lower legs but it can happen on the feet as well anywhere where you have chronic pressure the skin just breaks down and you have poor sensation there due to the neuropathy and that can be very very challenging to heal because again diabetics have very poor wound healing they often have to see a specialist to have these treated all right so diabetics they have poor healing poor circulation they get neuropathy and they have an impaired immune system and all of these things you know it leads to skin breakdown and makes them very very very prone to a wide variety of skin infections and one of the more common types of skin infections that diabetics get is candida it&amp;#39;s a yeast you know it causes yeast infections in women in the genital area it also can cause yeast infections of the genitalia in men uh it can cause a condition in the mouth on the corners of the mouth known as angular kelitis it can impact the tongue you can get a yeast infection of the tongue on the skin the nails it&amp;#39;s called a candidal paronychia now diabetics also can get a yeast infection in the web spaces between their fingers it&amp;#39;s called erosio interdigita blastomycetica eib it can cause little cracks in the skin allow for entry of other microorganisms put you at risk for you know a more severe type of infection but it&amp;#39;s a combination of poor circulation impaired immune and impaired immune system and an impaired skin barrier that really just makes diabetics quite prone to yeast infections number 15 another type of infection is going to be a bacterial skin infection and similarly to why diabetics are at risk for yeast infections they&amp;#39;re likewise at risk for a variety of bacterial infections staph bacteria that can cause impetigo it can cause folliculitis which is an infection of the hair follicle diabetics can get a type of skin infection called erythrosma this red painful rash due to a bacteria called carine bacterium pseudomonas is a bacteria that can infect the ear cause an ear infection but in diabetics because of their poor circulation their impaired immune system that bacteria can actually turn deadly in the ear it can get into the bone and actually get into the brain i mean it can be life-threatening number 16 is going to be fungal infections like ringworm toenail fungus foot fungus diabetics typically have typically have foot fungus or skin again it is it is a ripe for colonization of yeast bacteria and in this case what are called dermatophytes a type of skin fungus and last but not least number 17 being a diabetic you can have uh persistent facial redness you can have a red face it can also affect the neck and the upper chest this is called rubiosis not entirely sure why this happens but it is pretty common maybe due to you know the the microvascular disease that diabetics have fortunately it does typically improve when the diabetes is under better control all right you guys so those are 17 ways in which having diabetes can impact your skin you know diabetes it&amp;#39;s a serious medical condition regardless of the type that you have it is pretty serious it can can and does impact pretty much every organ system as i&amp;#39;ve said in all my videos your skin is a window to what is going on internally and you can see here how in the setting of diabetes with all of these underlying issues it really surfaces quite literally to the skin and there are a lot of clues going on to the patient&amp;#39;s underlying condition the severity of the disease the chronicity of it so if your doctor tells you that you have early diabetes or pre-diabetes insulin resistance please take it seriously i don&amp;#39;t think people really realize the potential for severity with this condition because it you know these things they don&amp;#39;t start appearing all at once but it can be the road that you&amp;#39;re going down if you don&amp;#39;t get it under control and dietary and lifestyle changes can make a difference for sure if you get that diagnosis from your doctor like hey i&amp;#39;m worried you know your sugars are hot something called the hemoglobin a1c definitely take it seriously you know it&amp;#39;s your life these are these are things that can show up if this gets out of hand and it certainly can and i&amp;#39;ve only scratched the surface here of some of the more common skin findings but we&amp;#39;re talking about diabetes i mean i already alluded to the neuropathy you can lose a limb that is not uncommon end-stage renal disease and diabetics having to be on dialysis um it&amp;#39;s a serious disease i would not wish this on anyone on and so if you if somebody had if your doctor has told you that they&amp;#39;re concerned that you have you know elevated blood glucose signs of early diabetes definitely do whatever you can to bring in whatever lifestyle factors you can&amp;#39;t exercising changing up your diet and and try and try and you know be proactive about it because this is the last thing that you want all right you guys i hope this video was informative and helpful if you liked it give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and as always don&amp;#39;t forget sunscreen and subscribe i&amp;#39;ll talk to you guys tomorrow bye [Music] you",

    "transcript": "hey y&amp;#39;all and welcome back to my channel let&amp;#39;s get into it today i want to talk about my diagnosis story or exactly how i accidentally found a nia type 1 diabetes and i&amp;#39;m telling you how i accidentally found out i had diabetes so that you can go get checked before you get to the point that i do because we did not we should have catched it or caught it earlier but we did not so this is kind of how it happened i got diagnosed in february i&amp;#39;m not exactly sure what year but i know i was at least in between seven to nine years old so i&amp;#39;m gonna just say for this video i was eight years old because that&amp;#39;s pretty i&amp;#39;m pretty sure that&amp;#39;s how old that was okay free hot dogs i just got a weird text about free hot dogs i think it&amp;#39;s a scam i was around let&amp;#39;s say i was eight years old it was december it was christmas eve um was the first warning sign now probably the year leading up to it i know i was losing a ton of weight to the point that i was like rib skinny um but we we didn&amp;#39;t really know what was happening i was living at my dad&amp;#39;s half of the time half time at my mom&amp;#39;s so there was more a little conflict there because i would get to each other&amp;#39;s house and they would just keep feeding me more and think that the other person wasn&amp;#39;t taking good care of me obvious diagnosis that would have been caught maybe if they were working together as a little team it would have worked out a bit different but it unfortunately did not it was christmas eve and i remember i was at my dad&amp;#39;s house and i was downstairs with all my cousins and there was this giant jube jube christmas tree okay with little toothpicks poking out with gummies and i went really hardcore i was addicted to candy and no diabetes does not come from eating too much sugar okay get that out of your mind before we start this video because i will not continue in all these jube jubes okay going ham and i start to feel really sick now that i think about it i was feeling the symptoms of a high blood sugar but i felt so sick and all my family just thought i had too much sugar ate too much candy and i felt sick which would be obviously the only thing to really think about because i ate so much candy okay ended up spending the rest of the night in my room in bed feeling like trash and that was just horrible i remember feeling like really sick i probably threw up i couldn&amp;#39;t get out of bed time went on felt better the next day i guess things went back to normal um now somewhere in between here from december to february i got diagnosed with pneumonia i was in the hospital i was really sick i don&amp;#39;t know if it&amp;#39;s related to getting diabetes or it was because of the diabetes that i got so sick from pneumonia i don&amp;#39;t even know how that happened but i was when i put on antibiotics and i remember the antibiotics weren&amp;#39;t working again why didn&amp;#39;t they just test me for diabetes so this is why it&amp;#39;s really important to know these symptoms okay i remember so i&amp;#39;m going back to school i think the antibiotics finally worked but i was i was i was pretty sick i get home one day and i was like mom i i&amp;#39;m so thirsty like i can&amp;#39;t stop drinking and it was really embarrassing because i would go over to a friend&amp;#39;s house and they were like even my little friends were like you&amp;#39;re losing a lot of weight like i can see your ribs and i was like oh i guess so like i don&amp;#39;t know like i was a kid i i i didn&amp;#39;t really know i was just i guess i&amp;#39;m losing a lot of weight but i was always a really skinny child i was still growing like crazy like i&amp;#39;m five foot eleven so i was always just on this massive growth for just going up okay remember i like got home one day and i was like mom i&amp;#39;ve been so thirsty i can&amp;#39;t stop drinking and i go to the kitchen and i&amp;#39;m drinking milk i&amp;#39;m drinking juice i&amp;#39;m drinking water and nothing&amp;#39;s taking the thirst away i&amp;#39;m peeing like crazy um at this point this is happening for a few days i&amp;#39;m wetting the bed like it was really really bad i had no control of my bladder and the amount of fluids i was flushing through my body was just like insane like it felt like i was living in a desert for weeks okay keep this in mind we just move into a shared house we were really really poor at this time this is with me and my mom and we were living at a place in richmond and this is just a little foreshadowing because we&amp;#39;re gonna have to mention why living in richmond was actually really really lucky for my diagnosis wake up one morning and when i think about it i must have felt sick and this was my way to communicate to my mom that i didn&amp;#39;t want to go but i lied to her and i was like mom i&amp;#39;ve got a sore throat i don&amp;#39;t want to go to school she was like you got to go to school mary and i was like i don&amp;#39;t want to go to school i have a sore throat i&amp;#39;m sick she was like well guess what then we&amp;#39;re going to take you to the doctor then if you have a sore throat and i was like really you&amp;#39;re going to go through all that effort to prove that i have a sore throne she was like yeah we&amp;#39;ll go get you for tested for strep throat blah blah blah anyways she got me in the car and i was still adamant that i had a sore throat i really just didn&amp;#39;t want to go to school okay we&amp;#39;re driving and this was the worst part when we were driving to the doctor we literally had to stop at the convenience store i think like one to three times and i would just chug and when you think about it i was chugging juice and considering we find out my blood sugar was high this was really really bad because i&amp;#39;m just adding to that sugar and my blood is just turning into acid and it&amp;#39;s really really bad we get to the doctor and i recently found out by talking to my mom that i actually went started going unconscious in the lobby i didn&amp;#39;t really know this obviously i was not feeling good i don&amp;#39;t know why i had to say i had a sore throat though okay and my mom goes up to the doctor i remember hearing this and i was really embarrassed for some reason but she was like can you test her for diabetes and i&amp;#39;m in my head i&amp;#39;m like mom that&amp;#39;s just for people that can&amp;#39;t have sugar people that are overweight like that&amp;#39;s the stereotypes that i learned as a kid which is a hundred percent wrong now i&amp;#39;m like an advocate for those stereotypes because they drive me nuts then i did a p-test and gave the cup to the doctor really fast after she came out and we she was like we have an emergency your blood sugar is at 44 okay um the conversion of that for people that live in the states or maybe if you measured other places is 792 so it is up there okay from there she was like we have to get you to the hospital immediately but unfortunately you don&amp;#39;t live in richmond so we can&amp;#39;t send you to the children&amp;#39;s hospital we have to get you on a helicopter and send you to vancouver island which is funnily enough where i live now but this is what i said remember in richmond because we just moved there so luckily we were able to go to the children&amp;#39;s hospin hospital in richmond bc told her that and she was like okay well i recommend taking an ambulance but if you can drive her to my mom and watch her just keep your eyes on her because she could just pass out at any point i think explaining i could go into a coma you just have to watch her on the way to the hospital the hospital in time they probably shot me up with some insulin which is hella good that&amp;#39;s kind of where it all started i remember i was so scared to test my blood sugar for the first time so the doctor was like oh we&amp;#39;ll let your mom do it first so my mom poked her finger funnily enough she actually has hypoglycemia and then i was like okay okay i can do it now like let me do it and then i poke my finger and i was like ow that hurts like a lot they were like well you&amp;#39;re gonna be doing that all the time and i was like oh man but now needles don&amp;#39;t even phase me so that&amp;#39;s pretty good if you&amp;#39;re newly diagnosed you&amp;#39;re gonna get so used to it it&amp;#39;s not that scary um if you&amp;#39;re doing sight changes by the way i wrote a doctor told me this once it&amp;#39;s like have a nice bath soften your skin and then do a slight change that helped me as a kid if you&amp;#39;re a little scared of doing the site changes because they can be allowed to go pow get back to after that night we get back to the house and one of the roommates in this house goes up to my mom and says oh your daughter was diagnosed with diabetes because i guess my mom told her him and he was like oh i have a cure for that like there&amp;#39;s these herbs i can give you and now if you say that to me you don&amp;#39;t want to be near me you don&amp;#39;t want to be me or me there is no cure okay we&amp;#39;re not even going to go there where i live the program was amazing that you because you were going to have to go for private coaching and group coaching with other diabetics to learn for like a week or a few days to make sure you know how to do insulin doses teaching the families and now luckily me after pneumonia after diabetes guess what i got i got lice i had a whole zoo up here actually kind of looked out with the lice because of the fact that i got private coaching one-on-one with the doctors for like i think was like three days straight we just kept coming back injections teaching about how to count carbs subtract the fibers insulin doses um they gave us like a meal plan on how i should eat with my diet which i should probably still follow which i do not that&amp;#39;s just kind of how my diagnosis story went how i accidentally found i had eye diabetes if any of those symptoms that i mentioned before go get a blood test or a urine test it does not hurt um it&amp;#39;s definitely better to be safe than sorry because i was probably on the edge of having a coma or dying because like that&amp;#39;s the worst case scenario yeah so that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s kind of how i got diabetes guys i will say overall i am very grateful that i was diagnosed as a kid because i don&amp;#39;t know my life any other way than having diabetes like i would not be i would not know what to do if i had to eat an apple and not take insulin for it like that would be weird to me so i&amp;#39;m thankful that i didn&amp;#39;t get in an adulthood i have a cousin that recently got diagnosed on my dad&amp;#39;s side um so i think there is a gene in somewhere with her with diabetes he got diagnosed with type 1 and um it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s a bigger life change getting diagnosed as an adult i can say because everything you have you have to change your whole lifestyle how you eat get used to everything and it&amp;#39;s just a lot of work so if anyone any age is going through this diagnosis it&amp;#39;s hard um to parents out there dealing with it it is hard i will say i&amp;#39;m so thankful that the point we are now in the world technology has really grown so like cgms we didn&amp;#39;t i mean when i first got diagnosed they recommended not to get a cgm because there was just too many things and they didn&amp;#39;t work well and so i would have to get tested and poke my finger in the middle of the night um it was hell for my parents unfortunately so um and it still is with if you even have the technology that you have now it is so difficult as a parent buddy oh don&amp;#39;t listen to comments out there people do not know what you&amp;#39;re going through especially for parents or people that are diagnosed with diabetes no one can really understand it unfortunately even my closest friends my closest family you don&amp;#39;t understand it unless you&amp;#39;re living through it like it&amp;#39;s really difficult funnily enough my blood sugar is high right now so we got my dinosaur with the dex gum on it we&amp;#39;re a little matching guys and uh yeah that out there i love you all subscribe comment turn on post notifications and if you have any more questions about like symptoms or anything like that for highs or lows i can get more into detail about that um but my message up to you today is that if you&amp;#39;re feeling any sort of reason that you might have diabetes just go get a check go get it checked out and uh yeah i&amp;#39;m gonna be doing what i eat on a day here soon i swear to god so yeah i&amp;#39;ll keep y&amp;#39;all posted okay love you guys bye",

be true right but in today&amp;#39;s video I&amp;#39;m going to \nshare with you a one cup secret drink which can   naturally help you to improve your blood sugars \nand even reverse diabetes so stay till the end   to know exactly how to make this recipe and how \nto consume it properly hi I&amp;#39;m Dr an Gupta a bore   certified family physician from us with Advanced \nTraining in functional medicine uh help people   with chronic diseases like diabetes and thyroid \nto improve their disease process the number of   people with diabetes or even with pre-diabetes is \nincreasing rapidly people are looking for natural   solutions to improve their blood sugar control \nas well as improve their diabetes and in today&amp;#39;s   video that&amp;#39;s what I&amp;#39;m going to discuss a number \none natural drink which has ingredients which   have shown in research studies they can improve \nblood sugar control and improve your diabetes   too and the interesting part is that this drink \nis very easy to make and by consuming it on the   regular basis people can see phenomenal results \nlet&amp;#39;s first talk about what is the root cause of   diabetes most of the people think the root cause \nof diabetes is linked to eating sugars but several   people have given up sugar but still they do not \nsee an improvement in their blood sugar numbers   or in their diabetes numbers so what is exactly \nhappening so there are two underlying root causes   which are happening in diabetes one is insulin \nresistance and the other one is inflammation in   the body so what is this insulin resistance so \nas you might all know insulin is a hormone which   helps us to control our blood sugars what happens \nin people with diabetes is that their cell becomes   resistant to insulin that means the cells in our \nbody are not able to utilize the existing insulin   and they become resistant to it so so they need \nhigher and higher amount of insulin to process   this sugar in turn this sugar starts building \nup in your blood and that&amp;#39;s the reason you   see increase blood sugars and also pre-diabetes \nand diabetes so it is very important to work on   insulin resistance to improve your diabetes \nnumber the second root cause is high amount   of inflammation this high amount of inflammation \ndirectly affects different parts of your body in   diabetes it espcially affects your adrenal glands \nas well as your liver both of these organs are   very important to maintain your blood sugars \nand higher amount of inflammation do not let   these organs function that&amp;#39;s the reason several \npeople will have fatty liver issues or they have   adrenal dysfunction the signs and symptoms of that \nthat you&amp;#39;re feeling tired fatigued or have brain   fog issues so it is very important to work on this \nunderlying inflammation also the good news is that   there are natural ingredients which can improve \ninsulin sensitivity as well as lower inflammation   in your body and thereby improving your blood \nsugar control naturally so let me first share   with you the secret ingredients in this particular \nrecipe that I would like you to consume and then   I&amp;#39;m going to tell you exactly how to make it and \nhow to consume it the first ingredient in this   list is fenugreek seeds yes fenugreek seeds have \nbeen used for centuries to improving blood sugar   control how exactly can fenugrec seeds help \nimprove your blood sugar control there are   various mechanisms one of the mechanisms is that \nthey are very high in soluble fiber being high   in soluble fiber they slow down the sugar and \nglucose absorption from your gut thereby do not   let that insulin Spike to happen plus fenugrec \nseeds also help improve the functioning of your   pancreatic beta cells thereby increasing your \ninsulin secretion the second ingredient in this   recipe is cinnamon cinnamon again helps improve \nyour blood sugar control by various mechanisms   one of the main role of cinnamon in your body is \nto improve the insulin sensitivity it directly   works on the insulin receptors of your body cells \nand thereby improving the insulin sensitivity so   that the insulin can enter your cells and can \nhelp control your blood sugars better cinnamon   also helps reducing inflammation in your body \nthereby helping your body to function better and   also improve your blood sugar control the third \ningredient in this list is turmeric turmeric as   you know is a very powerful antioxidant and \nanti-inflammatory compound and as I discussed   before one of the underlying causes in diabetes \nis inflammation so by directly working on reducing   inflammation in your body especially in your liver \nin your gut as well as in your pancreatic cells   turmeric helps improve your blood sugar control \nas well as your diabetes numbers so you will see   these three powerful ingredients are working on \nthree different Pathways to control your blood   sugar and also improve your diabetes numbers so \nnow let me tell you how to exactly prepare this   magic remedy and how to consume it properly so for \nthis you need 1 t spoon of fenric seed you need   to soak them overnight you need half a teaspoon of \nseon cinnamon powder then you need half a teaspoon   of turmeric powder as well as 1 cup of hot water \nto prepare this drink you need to boil one cup of   water and add 1 tablespoon of soaked fenugrec \nseeds into it then you turn the flame onto the   lower side and let this simmer for the next 4 to \n5 minutes so that all the useful ingredients from   fenugreek seed are mixed in into the water then \nyou switch out the flame and you add your cinnamon   and turmeric powder into this then you stir well \nthis mixture and let it cool slightly for the next   4 to 5 minutes and then you strain this mixture \ninto a cup and then you drink it warm what is   the best time to consume this one cup drink it is \nactually early in the morning empty stomach the   reason being these all ingredients will prepare \nyour body for the upcoming day and will help to   control your sugars as soon as you start eating \nyour breakfast breakfast as well as your lunch   and dinner so you can start consuming this one \ncup remedy in the morning you can always add a   second cup in the evening before your dinner to \nsee an improved control of your blood sugars so   here&amp;#39;s a caution if you&amp;#39;re already on Diabetes \nmedications make sure you&amp;#39;re checking your blood   sugars because this drink can lower your blood \nsugars so you have to be very careful that you   do not become hypoglycemic make sure you work \nwith your diabetes doctor so he or she can make   changes to your diabetes medications if required \nobviously this drink works if you&amp;#39;re doing other   lifestyle changes that means eating a healthy \ndiet which is low in carbohydrates as well as   high in fiber as well as do not forget to do some \nphysical exercises at least 10 to 15 minutes every   day so there you have it one cup natural remedy \nthat can help improve your blood sugar control   as well as can improve your diabetes numbers \nso start using this drink today and let me   know in the comment section if you see benefits \nin your blood sugars or not I hope you like this   video if

timely is very important otherwise it may progress it may be very difficult to treat especially when you have today I&amp;#39;m talking about 12 signs of poor diabetes control or insulin resistance on your skin let&amp;#39;s get into it have you been diagnosed with insulin resistance or type 2 diabetes there are 12 signs that you have to look out for hi everyone I&amp;#39;m Dr Ahmed ergen I&amp;#39;m an endocrinologist I&amp;#39;m known as sugar MD I&amp;#39;m a certified diabetes educator and endocrinologist seeing diabetic patients every day today we are talking about skin manifestations of diabetes or insulin resistance and as you know skin is one of the many organs that can be affected by diabetes diabetics who notice their skin being irritated by the diabetes may actually have high blood sugars due to uncontrolled diabetes or they they may not even know that they have diabetes before they see these signs on their skin make sure you watch the entire video because I promise you will learn something new and amazing today that will come handy later I hope you never have it but if you see on someone you may alert them I&amp;#39;ll give you a few tips about how to self-care about some of the conditions that I&amp;#39;m going to talk about and they&amp;#39;re going to be spread around this video so you better watch entire video If you want to get all the tips and tricks I&amp;#39;m sure you will appreciate to hear all these now it&amp;#39;s important to see your diabetes doctor and dermatologist occasionally if you&amp;#39;re seeing any of the following signs okay number one skin patches that are yellow reddish or brown in other words we call this lipoidica necrobiosis these are small raised firm bumps that resemble pimples that are common symptoms of that disorder these pimples become bloated hard patches of skin as the time goes on yellow reddish or brown spots can also appear in time necrobiosis lepoidica is characterized by red puffy and hard patches on the legs you may also notice the following things the skin around it may have a gleaming porcelain like finish the blood vessels can also be seen your skin can be irritated and inflamed that skin condition goes through phases of activity and inactivity or sometimes reactivation so again necropiosis lepoidica is a medical term for this I will say take action now if you have not been diagnosed with diabetes or if you have uncontrolled diabetes you need to either get tested or control your diabetes better make sure you work with your doctor to improve your diabetes management if you are having that condition although necrobiosis lepoidica is not harmful it can cause difficulties and it is definitely not very sightly number 2. velvety feeling that there&amp;#39;s darker patches of skin that may indicate that you may have too much insulin in your body if you have a like a black or brown patch of velvety skin it could be on the back of your neck it could be under your armpits or groin or elsewhere and this is very common with pre-diabetes as well yes we&amp;#39;re talking about a contosis nigricans that&amp;#39;s the medical name for the skin disorder acanthosis sniper cans is going to cause darker skin as you talk on the neck and especially in the creases of your skin maybe the first indicator of diabetes or insulin resistance number three skin that is hardening and thickening well we call that digital sclerosis is a medical term for that and it affects the fingers it can affect your toes or both on your hands the back of your hands will have a tight waxy skin fingers actually can stiffen and it can become even difficult to move if your diabetes has been inadequately managed for years it can feel like you have pebbles in your fingertips as well your skin will be hard and thick in this condition and it can be swollen looking as well and it can expand to your forearms and upper arms as well it can appear on the upper back sometimes the shoulders and neck occasionally the thickening of the skin can sometimes expand all the way over to your face and shoulder and chest and that&amp;#39;s not fun now skin around the knees the ankles and elbows can occasionally thicken in rare situations making it difficult to straighten your leg or Point your food or bend your arm and so forth the thicker skin often has the texture of an orange peel wherever it appears people with diabetic complications are difficult to treat diabetes are more likely to develop this condition so if you have this make sure you inform your diabetes doctor about that thickness on your skin taking better control of your diabetes can definitely make you feel better again alpha lipoic acid benphotiamine Etc will be helpful in this condition as well Physical Therapy may be sometimes required if you have physical limitations or it can help you preserve your ability to bend and straighten your joints when the thickened skin develops especially on your fingers or Toes or other joints number four blisters well it is kind of uncommon that people with diabetes May develop blisters on their skin it can be a huge blister a group of blisters or both can be visible the blisters appear typically on the hands to feed the legs or the forearms and resemble those that appear like after a severe burn these blisters are not typically painful unlike the blisters that form after a burn so it&amp;#39;s just gonna look like a balloon on top of your skin okay so we call this below this diabeticorum is the medical term just to make it fancy right it&amp;#39;s complicated or we call this diabetic bully if you want to consider is your name for it those blisters should be reported to your doctor because you will want to take precautions to avoid the infection so I would say consult with your primary care doctor or your podiatrist or your dermatologist or if you have a diabetes coach and get some advice on how to effectively manage your diabetes and that blister number five infections on the skin well if you&amp;#39;re experiencing a lot of yeast infections if you are experiencing any sort of impaction if you&amp;#39;re prone to infection then you may have diabetes or uncontrolled diabetes if you have a skin infection you will notice one or more of these things number one that your skin will be hot it will be swollen and it will be definitely uncomfortable you may also know notice an itchy rash with small blisters your skin can be dry and scaly and discharges are common it can be pus or cottage cheese appearing discharge is possible with skin infections it can happen anywhere on your body but it&amp;#39;s more common between your toes around one or more nails or even your scalp keeping your toes or toenails dry is extremely important to prevent fungal infections treating skin infections timely is very important otherwise it may progress it may be very difficult to treat especially when you have diabetes and uncontrolled diabetes with high blood sugars guys and if you have been diagnosed with diabetes sometimes you require more effective treatments or bigger antibiotics or more antibiotics or longer duration of antibiotics ETC number six are open wounds and sores now this is a little more than an infection it doesn&amp;#39;t have to be infected but if you have a poor circulation or a nerve damage this could be from uncontrolled diabetes in most cases then you may develop your these wounds or deep ulcers your body&amp;#39;s ability to repair the simple ones and maybe hampered because of this poor circulation and nerve damage as a result when you have a little lesion it becomes complicated and gets deeper and deeper and it turns into an ulcer an open lesion that is prone to infection so if you have diabetes you should inspect your feed for sores and open wounds on a daily basis don&amp;#39;t really expect your doctor or nurse to check your feet like every three to six months because if you have a lesion it may get worse within a few days so you need to check it every day do your own investigation it is I&amp;#39;m telling you 100 times more effective if you have a open sore or wound I would say seek medical attention right away because untreated lesions can lead to severe infections and sometimes amputation I need you to work with your doctor closely if you see things like that on your skin number seven Shin spots the skin condition generates spots and occasionally some lines on the skin that create a barely visible depression patients with diabetes are more likely to experience a condition although it&amp;#39;s not specific to diabetics but we call this diabetic dermopathy anyways if you have diabetes it typically develops on The Shins in rare circumstances it can appear on the arms the thighs the trunk or other parts of your body as well these brown spots are common and they actually have no symptoms many individuals mistake them for like aging spots as a result of these you know not having no symptoms these spots or lines unlike eight spots normally vanish with an 18 to 24 months diabetic thermopathy can last sometimes permanently if you do not control your diabetes number eight is small reddish yellow lumps in other words we call this eruptive zantomatosis These Lumps frequently resemble pimples when they emerge unlike the pimples though they turn a yellowish tint super quickly these bumps are generally found on the buttocks the thighs the elbow and back of the knees they can however form pretty much anywhere they are frequently sensitive and itchy regardless of where they occur now eruptives onto mitosis is a medical term for this and when your diabetes is well controlled these bumps are typically disappear super quickly number nine raised lumps that are red or skin colored and we call them granuloma and laurae it is debatable whether the skin issue is directly linked to diabetes but as far as we know the majority of P people with granuloma anilare do not have diabetes but on the other hand a lot of Investigations also discovered that this skin problem specifically is more common in diabetic people so in a way that most people do not have but let&amp;#39;s say the incidence of that disorder is like one percent and non-diabetic but three percent in a diabetic so it makes diabetics more susceptible to the skin disorder so if you have granuloma and Lara that comes and goes you should be evaluated for diabetes according to a few studies that are published recently this skin disorder causes bumps and it also comes with patches that are skin colored sometimes red and pink or bluish and purple so if you get pimples like the ones seen especially below like this one here tell your doctor especially if they&amp;#39;re common and going all right number 10 the most common one dry itchy skin that&amp;#39;s extremely dry itchy skin is super common in people with diabetes this can be caused by high blood sugar for sure but it can also be caused by a skin infection or poor circulation as well CeraVe is a good product that if you want to use on that dry skin number 11 scaly spots on around your eyes that are yellowish in color and we call this zantel lasma zantalasma these appear when your body fat cells are too high in your blood it also indicates that your diabetes is poorly managed so watch out guys and the last one the tags on your skin now many people have skin tags right they&amp;#39;re like little growths on their skin that hang on a style can stuff like that while skin tags are generally harmless having a lot of them could actually indicate that you have way too much insulin in your blood or that you may actually have type 2 diabetes already so the eyes the neck the armpit the groin are the most typical size sides for these growths here are my tips that I promised in the beginning of this video how to care for blisters let&amp;#39;s talk about that number one well I would not attempt to pop or break the blister because the blisters are protected from the infection with the skin that covers it I would say just wash the affected area gently with warm water and some mild soap antibacterial ointment should also be applied to the bilister without popping it and I would say I would cover that as well with a gauze without making it too tight you can use some cotton bandage as well I would use hypoallergenic or paper tape to secure the delusion as well at least once that they change the bandage wear a different pair of shoes until the blister cures if it is on your foot especially and if it is due to your shoes now let&amp;#39;s talk about small cuts and rashes how to really take care of them you need to wash the affected area again gently with water warm and Mild soap do not try to dump alcohol on it that&amp;#39;s not really going to help and it actually hurt it I would say apply some antibiotic to the affected area covered again with gauze pad or a cotton bandage I would use some hypoallergenic paper tape to secure it and I would say again change your bandage once a day I would also check the area frequently to ensure that the discomfort is not worsening and infection is not worsening or developing so that concludes our video today I hope you learned something new today remember to like share and subscribe guys and write something in the comment section if you have experienced any of these conditions and tell us what you have done about it so thank you very much we&amp;#39;ll see you in the next video hey guys I hope you are enjoying

    "transcript": "you know what fascinates me most about diabetes it is not actually about genetics like we have been told after working with thousands of diabetes patients I have discovered something that is going to change everything you thought you knew about blood sugar control let me share something personal I remember watching my grandmother meticulously counting her carbs measuring her portions yet still struggling with her blooder like many of you she believed diabetes was her Destiny because it runs in the family but here&amp;#39;s the shocking truth type 2 diabetes isn&amp;#39;t a genetic sentence it is largely about how our modern food environment has betrayed us think about insulin as a key that unlocks your cells to let glucose in when you are constantly flooding your body with carbs and sugar it is like making hundreds of copies of that key eventually your cells just stop responding that is insulin resistance but here&amp;#39;s the exciting part you can actually reverse this process you know what is really mindblowing your body does not actually need carbohydrates to survive I know shocking right we have essential amino acids and essential fatty acids but there is no such thing as essential carbohydrate your body can make all the glucose it needs through a process called glucon neogenesis let me take you into your kitchen for a moment those healthy whole grain crackers in your pantry they&amp;#39;re actually packing 10% more carbs than what is listed on the label and that diabetic friendly breakfast cereal forget it it might be spiking your blood sugar more than a table sugar this is why I&amp;#39;m so excited about combining smart food choices with proper supplementation many of my patients have found remarkable success using like our sugar MD Advanced glucose support alongside the dietary changes it is like giving your body an extra tool to help maintain healthy blood sugar levels at all times but before we dive deeper into Solutions let&amp;#39;s understand what happens when you eat different types of foods when you eat carbohydrates for example your blood sugar and Insulin Spike dramatically with protein there is a much smaller rice but with fat almost nothing happens especially with healthy fats it&amp;#39;s like a flatline on your graph on your CGM here&amp;#39;s some gamechanging food hacks for you for diabetes control speaking of food let me share something fascinating about pasta that changed everything for my patients you know how Italians seem to eat pasta all the time and yet they have lower diabetes rates than the US it is all in how they prepare it they use high fiber varieties they add olive oil and here&amp;#39;s the key they never overcook that elante texture actually lowers it his glycemic index but here&amp;#39;s even more incredible hack freezing your bread or pasta can actually make it better for your blood sugar right sounds crazy well when you freeze bread or pasta and th it properly the starch molecules restructure in a way that makes them harder for your body to break down one of my patients who combined this technique with the advanced glucose support saw remark able improvements in her postmeal BL sugar spikes let&amp;#39;s talk about beverages for a moment this is where most people get tripped up the 12 oz can of cola you&amp;#39;re having with lunch it is picking 40 gram of carbs that is more than many diabetics should have in any meal don&amp;#39;t even get me started on those fancy coffee drinks a 16 oz caramel macchiato has about 60 gr of carbs that&amp;#39;s like eating four slices of bread here&amp;#39;s what I recommend to my patients start your day with water and lemon maybe some black coffee with heavy cream take your Advanced glucose support supplement and if you need something sweet later try my special sweet potato hack this is fascinating if you boil a sweet potato for 30 minutes instead of 8 minutes it is glycemic index drops from 61 down to 46 science is amazing isn&amp;#39;t it now let&amp;#39;s talk about exercise and blood sugar because this is where most people get it wrong you might think intense exercise is better but gentle movement is actually more effective for managing diabetes when you exercise intensely your body releases stress hormones that can raise your blood sugar but a gentle 10-minute walk after every meal well that&amp;#39;s perfect for helping your muscles use up that excess glucose the yogurt situation is another perfect example of food marketing gone wrong those lowfat yogurts are basically desserts in Disguise about 60% of their calories come from sugar instead opt for full fat plain Greek yogurt add some berries if you need sweetness the fiber will help slow down sugar absorption now I&amp;#39;m going to talk about some revolutionary signs of natural blood sugar control what is it well you know those expensive glp1 medications everyone is talking about like semaglutide and turati let me share something exciting that your doctor probably hasn&amp;#39;t told you about your body can actually produce it as own glp1 naturally it is like having your own diabetes defense system built right in I remember one of my longtime patients came to me frustrated about the cost of the glp1 medications well together we discovered that certain foods combined with the glucose Advanced glucose support that she was taking could help her body optimize it his own glp1 production the results were incredible and now let&amp;#39;s talk about bone broth it&amp;#39;s not just a trendy health food it is rich in glutamine which is like rocket fuel for your glp1 system I recommend making it at home but here&amp;#39;s a trick you need to simmer those bones for at least 24 hours one of my patients swears by having a cup of bone broth before meals along with her Advanced glucose support supplement and she says it has completely changed her relationship with food now here&amp;#39;s something fascinating about bitter Foods also they&amp;#39;re like secret weapon for diabetes management you heard me right bitter foods every time you taste something bitter you&amp;#39;re actually triggering glp1 release think about arugula dandelion greens or even fresh herbs like Rosemary it is Nature&amp;#39;s Way of helping us control blood sugar but timing is everything here&amp;#39;s a gamechanging strategy start your meals with bitter greens dressed in apple cider vinegar the vinegar slows carb absorption while the bitter greens stimulate glp1 add some protein and you have created the perfect BL sugar friendly start to your meal let&amp;#39;s talk about fermented food they&amp;#39;re not just good for gut health but like kimchi sarra traditional pickles these Foods create short chain fatty acids that trigger glp1 release it is like having a natural diabetes medication working for you when combined with the advanced glucose support many of my my patients report feeling satisfied for hours while maintaining the stable blood sugar levels and here&amp;#39;s another mindblowing tip about meal timing eating your protein and vegetables before any carb can increase the glp1 release by up to 300% imagine starting every meal this way it&amp;#39;s like having your body&amp;#39;s natural diabetes medication working at full strength you know what is really exciting when patients combine all of these strategies the food timing the bitter greens the fermented foods the proper supplementation with Advanced glucose support we often see remarkable improvements while everyone&amp;#39;s results are different the signs behind this approach is solid let me share something personal I had a patient who was taking 300 units of insulin daily you heard me right 300 units after implementing these strategies including proper supplementation and daty changes she was able to reduce her insulin by 60% while this isn&amp;#39;t typical for everyone but it shows what is possible when you give your body the right support remember this isn&amp;#39;t about deprivation it is about understanding how your body works and making informed choices whether it is starting your meal with bitter greens timing your carbs right or supporting your body with the advanced glucose support any change will count I want to leave you with this though diabetes does not have to control your life with the right knowledge and support he can take back control of your health start with one change today maybe it is adding some fermented foods to your diet or trying that bone broth trick add proper supplementation like the advanc cical support remember every step forward no matter how small is a progress a future of diabetes management isn&amp;#39;t about more medications it is about understanding your body and giving it the support it needs to th life whether through natural supplements smart choices or lifestyle changes you have more control than you think take that first step today your future self will thank you",

    "transcript": "If your blood sugar is high then in this video, I will tell you 5 easy ways which helps you to lower your blood sugar naturally so let&amp;#39;s start this interesting video my name is Dr. Salim Zaidi and you&amp;#39;re watching &amp;quot;HEALTHY HAMESHA&amp;quot; The first tip for controlling your blood sugar level is you have to intake more fiber in your diet there are two types of fiber, first is Soluble Fiber and second is Insoluble Fiber soluble fiber makes gel-type things when it mixes with water and insoluble fiber is present in fruits and vegetables which provides roughage in our body both fibers are suitable for controlling your blood sugar level but if we compare both fibers so soluble fiber which makes gel-type structure is comparatively more effective in controlling your blood sugar level as compared to insoluble fiber so try to add more things in your diet with more soluble fiber like you get a lot of soluble fiber in oats, you have to eat oats there is a lot of soluble fiber inside the okra and in Psyllium Husk you get a lot of soluble fiber also, you get soluble fiber in Beans and pulses, and lentils so add these things to your diet other than these, you get insoluble fiber in fruits and vegetables in the form of roughage you have to also intake this, this will improve your digestion and it also helps to lessen your blood sugar level and to slow down its absorption the second most important thing to regulate blood sugar is exercise when you exercise then insulin sensitivity got increases in your body in 90% of cases when you have Type 2 Diabetes then your body shells don&amp;#39;t absorb sugar due to being less insulin sensitive and then your blood sugar level got high and when you exercise then your insulin sensitivity got increases and your blood sugar level got decreased other than this, when you do exercise then your muscles have to work more then it absorbs the sugar from your blood and burns it and this will help you to lower your blood sugar level also exercise helps you to lower your stress level it also reduces fat stress and fat are the  two things that play a major role in increasing your blood sugar level and developing diabetes and indirectly when these two things affect then you got help in your blood sugar levels in diabetes if you had diabetes then you have to do 30-45 minutes of moderate exercise daily like playing badminton, also you can do treadmill you can go jogging, swimming, and cycling if your health doesn&amp;#39;t allow you this and you can&amp;#39;t do these things then you do walk, it will help you lot but you have to do a minimum of half an hour and a maximum of an hour&amp;#39;s walk if you walk for 5-10 minutes you will not get any benefits the third and easiest way to lower your blood sugar level is you have to intake more water you must have to drink 1 to 1.25 L water daily if you have diabetes the first benefit is, When you have diabetes, you have frequent urination by this dehydration chances got increased and due to that, there is a lack of water inside your body so the first benefit is that, when you intake more water, you won&amp;#39;t be dehydrated and the second and most important benefit is when you have diabetes your kidney absorbs the extra sugar in your blood and extrudes it through urination and if you have a lack of water then kidneys can&amp;#39;t absorb sugar properly, and sugar won&amp;#39;t extrude out through urination and if your blood sugar is increased due to diabetes, then the most important thing is What you eat in your diet and how much you eat usually, we do overeating in the case of diabetes when we got something good to eat or at parties and due to overeating, our calorie intake got increased by which chances increase of higher blood sugar level now a second thing, what you eat is also very important if you have diabetes then you don&amp;#39;t have to take high-carbohydrate food you don&amp;#39;t have to take cola&amp;#39;s and soft drinks you don&amp;#39;t have to intake soda also, don&amp;#39;t intake juices because they have concentrated forms of sugar also, you don&amp;#39;t have to intake sweets and desserts if you intake these things, your diabetes got increases and your insulin sensitivity got decreases, and you gain fat due to this and all these things increase your diabetes complications Also, nature provides us some herbs and home remedies which helps you to lower your blood sugar level naturally like google cider vinegar is a very good thing that has the power to lower your blood sugar level so if you have diabetes then you have to take 1 tablespoon or a maximum of 2 tablespoons of apple cider vinegar in a glass of water  before half an hour of eating also, you can take fenugreek water take 1 tablespoon of fenugreek and put it in a glass of water at night and in the morning boil the water properly and then filter the water and drink it also, you can eat the fenugreek seeds if you don&amp;#39;t want to take these things then you can also use Cinnamon put a big piece of Cinnamon in a glass of water and oil it and make tea of it and filter it and drink it, it will help you to lower your blood sugar level I hope you love today&amp;#39;s video and that the tips I shared with you will help you in the case of diabetes and you will maintain your diabetes naturally

    "transcript": "Hello guys! How are you? That diabetes is an extremely dangerous disease you already know! I&amp;#39;ve explained in several videos about the evils of poorly controlled diabetes; that glycated hemoglobin above 7 can already be harmful to your body and that you can forget your mother&amp;#39;s name, your father&amp;#39;s name, your home address, but if you are diabetic you have to know the value of your glycated hemoglobin ! Glycated hemoglobin estimates how much your average blood glucose has been in the last 90 days. Therefore, it is important for you to know if it is well controlled, because it will define whether your vessels, your kidneys and especially your heart are getting sick or not. Aglycated hemoglobin values ​​above 9 are terrible; lead to leg amputation, loss of sensation in arms and legs, greatly increase the risk of heart attack and stroke! So how do you manage your diabetes? How to keep your glycated hemoglobin below 7? What foods do you, who are diabetics, have to eat all the time, that are nutritious and that will help you control your glucose, do you know? If you don&amp;#39;t know, today I&amp;#39;m going to show you 10 essential foods and that if you who are diabetic start eating routinely, your glycated hemoglobin will improve a lot, that is, your diabetes will improve a lot. So, come with me until the end of the video and... Run the vignette! Dr. Roberto Yano, Cardiologist. Hello, friends of the heart! How are you? I am Doctor Roberto Yano, Cardiologist and Pacemaker Specialist. Today I&amp;#39;m going to show you 10 essential foods that you who are diabetic should consume in your daily life to keep your glucose always well controlled. And for you who are not diabetic, these foods are also very important because they will prevent you from becoming diabetic one day! But first, I&amp;#39;m going to ask you to share the video, ok? Mainly for your father, your diabetic mother, or a diabetic that you like a lot; show him this video! A change in diet can save that person&amp;#39;s life! Without further ado, let&amp;#39;s go to the 10 foods? Food number 1, there&amp;#39;s no excuse for you not to eat it... It&amp;#39;s the egg. The egg is a complete food, it is rich in minerals, proteins; and, unlike what many imagine, consuming eggs in moderation will not increase your cholesterol, ok? So stay calm! In addition, the egg has a low amount of glucose, but is rich in minerals and antioxidant agents. So, don&amp;#39;t forget to introduce the egg in your diet, ok? Food number 2: oats. Oatmeal is a carbohydrate, but why does it help control diabetes? Oats are extremely high in fiber; the fibers form as if it were a mesh that prevent the rapid absorption of glucose! And oatmeal can be used in any meal, whether for breakfast, lunch or dinner. You can use oatmeal easily and in any food, just have a little creativity! Once again I repeat: because it is a source of carbohydrate, it has to be eaten in moderation, ok! No exaggeration! But let&amp;#39;s go! Food number 3: the avocado. I always talk about the avocado! In addition to being a delicious fruit, it is extremely nutritious! Your fat is one of the healthiest fats out there! Especially for our hearts! Because it is a food rich in fat, it makes the absorption of glucose occur more gradually, slower, avoiding insulin spikes, and better controlling your glucose! And, it is worth saying, the avocado is wonderful, it is delicious! You can use it in juice, salad, even as a seasoning you can use it! It works for everything! So make avocado one of your favorite fruits! Fourth food: fish. Fish like tuna, sardines and salmon are rich in anti-inflammatory foods, rich in good fats, fats that protect the heart! So, you see that not all fat is bad? On the contrary, there are many types of fats that are essential and fundamental for our heart! For you to consume correctly, you need to know what they are! Look how many good fat options I gave you just in this video! Just for that I already deserve your like, don&amp;#39;t you? So, leave your like! Don&amp;#39;t forget, leave a like! Well, the fifth food is chia. Chia has a combination of several elements that will help the diabetic. First, it has a great power of satiety. A little you consume makes you satisfied! Another thing is that it is rich in fiber, which helps to make glucose be absorbed more slowly; it also has excellent fat, which I have already explained above. It will help to reduce the speed of absorption of sugar, carbohydrates! It is important to talk about this issue of satiety too, because the diabetic is exactly that patient who is the most hungry! Imagine that, the diabetic&amp;#39;s blood is full of sugar, but his cells that needed to have more sugar, are low on sugar; this makes the body understand that your body is always lacking sugar and the diabetic is excessively hungry. So chia will help with satiety! So, always have chia at home, ok? Sixth food: legumes. Legumes like beans, peas and lentils are excellent sources of fiber and will help with glycemic control. In addition, legumes in general are rich in vitamins, minerals and proteins that are essential for our health and for maintaining good control of our blood glucose; besides being delicious, of course! Come on! Seventh food: red fruits. Most berries like strawberries, blueberries and raspberries are low carb! In addition, these fruits have excellent antioxidant power and are rich in fiber! Knowing that the diabetic lives a little inflamed, anti-inflammatory foods will be essential for the good control of our glucose! In fact, I talk more about anti-inflammatory foods in this video that I&amp;#39;ll leave on the card. If you haven&amp;#39;t seen it yet, I&amp;#39;m sure it will be worth it! Eighth food; this food is not lacking at home: it is extra virgin olive oil! Extra virgin olive oil also has excellent anti-inflammatory power! In addition to being one of the best fats for the heart because it reduces LDL cholesterol, which is bad cholesterol, increases HDL cholesterol, which is good cholesterol and, as it is a fat, it also slows down the absorption of sugar by our intestines! But, like any fat, it has to be eaten in moderation, because all fat, no matter how healthy, does make you fat! So consume, but in moderation! Come on! Ninth food. But first, have you already subscribed to the channel? Have you clicked the bell to receive all notifications? Have you already liked this video and all my videos that you liked? Oh good! Fortunately! If you&amp;#39;ve done all this, I&amp;#39;m glad! But if you haven&amp;#39;t already, no problem! After the video you subscribe and click the bell, ok? But, coming back, ninth food: dark green leaves. Leaves like broccoli, kale, spinach and arugula are rich in fiber, minerals and antioxidant elements!

    "transcript": "Hello guys! How are you? That diabetes is an extremely dangerous disease you already know! I&amp;#39;ve explained in several videos about the evils of poorly controlled diabetes; that glycated hemoglobin above 7 can already be harmful to your body and that you can forget your mother&amp;#39;s name, your father&amp;#39;s name, your home address, but if you are diabetic you have to know the value of your glycated hemoglobin ! Glycated hemoglobin estimates how much your average blood glucose has been in the last 90 days. Therefore, it is important for you to know if it is well controlled, because it will define whether your vessels, your kidneys and especially your heart are getting sick or not. Aglycated hemoglobin values ​​above 9 are terrible; lead to leg amputation, loss of sensation in arms and legs, greatly increase the risk of heart attack and stroke! So how do you manage your diabetes? How to keep your glycated hemoglobin below 7? What foods do you, who are diabetics, have to eat all the time, that are nutritious and that will help you control your glucose, do you know? If you don&amp;#39;t know, today I&amp;#39;m going to show you 10 essential foods and that if you who are diabetic start eating routinely, your glycated hemoglobin will improve a lot, that is, your diabetes will improve a lot. So, come with me until the end of the video and... Run the vignette! Dr. Roberto Yano, Cardiologist. Hello, friends of the heart! How are you? I am Doctor Roberto Yano, Cardiologist and Pacemaker Specialist. Today I&amp;#39;m going to show you 10 essential foods that you who are diabetic should consume in your daily life to keep your glucose always well controlled. And for you who are not diabetic, these foods are also very important because they will prevent you from becoming diabetic one day! But first, I&amp;#39;m going to ask you to share the video, ok? Mainly for your father, your diabetic mother, or a diabetic that you like a lot; show him this video! A change in diet can save that person&amp;#39;s life! Without further ado, let&amp;#39;s go to the 10 foods? Food number 1, there&amp;#39;s no excuse for you not to eat it... It&amp;#39;s the egg. The egg is a complete food, it is rich in minerals, proteins; and, unlike what many imagine, consuming eggs in moderation will not increase your cholesterol, ok? So stay calm! In addition, the egg has a low amount of glucose, but is rich in minerals and antioxidant agents. So, don&amp;#39;t forget to introduce the egg in your diet, ok? Food number 2: oats. Oatmeal is a carbohydrate, but why does it help control diabetes? Oats are extremely high in fiber; the fibers form as if it were a mesh that prevent the rapid absorption of glucose! And oatmeal can be used in any meal, whether for breakfast, lunch or dinner. You can use oatmeal easily and in any food, just have a little creativity! Once again I repeat: because it is a source of carbohydrate, it has to be eaten in moderation, ok! No exaggeration! But let&amp;#39;s go! Food number 3: the avocado. I always talk about the avocado! In addition to being a delicious fruit, it is extremely nutritious! Your fat is one of the healthiest fats out there! Especially for our hearts! Because it is a food rich in fat, it makes the absorption of glucose occur more gradually, slower, avoiding insulin spikes, and better controlling your glucose! And, it is worth saying, the avocado is wonderful, it is delicious! You can use it in juice, salad, even as a seasoning you can use it! It works for everything! So make avocado one of your favorite fruits! Fourth food: fish. Fish like tuna, sardines and salmon are rich in anti-inflammatory foods, rich in good fats, fats that protect the heart! So, you see that not all fat is bad? On the contrary, there are many types of fats that are essential and fundamental for our heart! For you to consume correctly, you need to know what they are! Look how many good fat options I gave you just in this video! Just for that I already deserve your like, don&amp;#39;t you? So, leave your like! Don&amp;#39;t forget, leave a like! Well, the fifth food is chia. Chia has a combination of several elements that will help the diabetic. First, it has a great power of satiety. A little you consume makes you satisfied! Another thing is that it is rich in fiber, which helps to make glucose be absorbed more slowly; it also has excellent fat, which I have already explained above. It will help to reduce the speed of absorption of sugar, carbohydrates! It is important to talk about this issue of satiety too, because the diabetic is exactly that patient who is the most hungry! Imagine that, the diabetic&amp;#39;s blood is full of sugar, but his cells that needed to have more sugar, are low on sugar; this makes the body understand that your body is always lacking sugar and the diabetic is excessively hungry. So chia will help with satiety! So, always have chia at home, ok? Sixth food: legumes. Legumes like beans, peas and lentils are excellent sources of fiber and will help with glycemic control. In addition, legumes in general are rich in vitamins, minerals and proteins that are essential for our health and for maintaining good control of our blood glucose; besides being delicious, of course! Come on! Seventh food: red fruits. Most berries like strawberries, blueberries and raspberries are low carb! In addition, these fruits have excellent antioxidant power and are rich in fiber! Knowing that the diabetic lives a little inflamed, anti-inflammatory foods will be essential for the good control of our glucose! In fact, I talk more about anti-inflammatory foods in this video that I&amp;#39;ll leave on the card. If you haven&amp;#39;t seen it yet, I&amp;#39;m sure it will be worth it! Eighth food; this food is not lacking at home: it is extra virgin olive oil! Extra virgin olive oil also has excellent anti-inflammatory power! In addition to being one of the best fats for the heart because it reduces LDL cholesterol, which is bad cholesterol, increases HDL cholesterol, which is good cholesterol and, as it is a fat, it also slows down the absorption of sugar by our intestines! But, like any fat, it has to be eaten in moderation, because all fat, no matter how healthy, does make you fat! So consume, but in moderation! Come on! Ninth food. But first, have you already subscribed to the channel? Have you clicked the bell to receive all notifications? Have you already liked this video and all my videos that you liked? Oh good! Fortunately! If you&amp;#39;ve done all this, I&amp;#39;m glad! But if you haven&amp;#39;t already, no problem! After the video you subscribe and click the bell, ok? But, coming back, ninth food: dark green leaves. Leaves like broccoli, kale, spinach and arugula are rich in fiber, minerals and antioxidant elements! For sure, you diabetic and non-diabetic, you have to include these leaves in your day to day routine! These foods are essential for your heart health! As I always say, everything that comes straight from nature is much healthier and much more nutritious than stuffing yourself with processed foods, full of trans fats, full of empty calories. Feeding from nature will definitely protect your heart! And, tenth and final food to lower your blood sugar, what is it? It&amp;#39;s the oilseeds! They shouldn&amp;#39;t be missing from mine and your diet! So, consume walnuts, chestnuts, macadamia nuts, pistachios and hazelnuts. In addition to being one of the main sources of good fats, oilseeds are also anti-inflammatory foods, reduce oxidative stress, help reduce insulin resistance and have high satiety power! They are more expensive, but the little you consume, a little bit a day, will definitely help your diabetes! Look, guys, how much good food, even for you who have diabetes, for you who have pre-diabetes, now there&amp;#39;s no excuse! You already know what you have to eat, just apply! Be better than your biggest excuse! Change your habits, practice quality of life, practice health, take care of your body and your health! Here I mentioned just a few foods, but there are many others that diabetics can use! If you liked the subject, leave it here in the comments below; if it has a good engagement, I&amp;#39;ll do the second part of this video! And, of course, whenever possible, look for a good Nutritionist to help you use all these foods in the correct amounts, so you can get the best possible result! If you have any questions, you can also leave them here in the comments! Although I can&amp;#39;t answer everyone, it helps me a lot to come up with new ideas to produce new videos! So, comment below what you think or if you have any questions! OK people! So, today&amp;#39;s message is this! A big hug and until next time!",

device can alert a diabetic individual when their blood sugar levels are too high or too low allowing them to take corrective action promptly seven blood sugar monitoring regular blood sugar monitoring is crucial for managing diabetes this involves using a glucometer to check blood sugar levels at home the frequency of monitoring will vary depending on individual needs and treatment plans example a diabetic individual on insulin therapy may need to check their blood sugar levels several times a day while those on oral medications May check less frequently eight Stress Management stress can significantly impact blood sugar levels finding healthy ways to manage stress such as yoga meditation or spending time in nature can help improve diabetes control example a diabetic individual

    "transcript": "There are herbs that are true natural remedies and have the ability to lower your blood sugar. They are cinnamon, ginseng, bitter melon and I&amp;#39;m even going to talk about spinach, tomato and broccoli. In this talk I want to tell you how these herbs, these plants work in your body and what the experts say about using them, how you should use them and how you can benefit from them. We have said on multiple occasions that high blood sugar is very dangerous. It is a fundamental risk factor for heart attacks, for having a baby, for kidney damage. When you have high blood sugar, the same sugar oxidizes, inflames you and damages you. Diabetes is a terrible risk factor and you have to keep it at bay. And if you eat properly, if you exercise and if you know some secrets, then you will live healthier. Let&amp;#39;s start talking about cinnamon. Cinnamon is the bark of a tree and is used as a spice to replace sugar, which is so toxic, because it has a slightly sweet taste. Cinnamon really acts like a pill in your body because it has powerful antioxidants, anti-inflammatories, but it also has substances that can lower blood sugar. See how he does it. First of all, it acts at the level of your intestine so that you absorb more sugar. In general, you eat foods that are like this, that are several sugars, one attached to the other. This cannot be absorbed. You need an enzyme to break these molecules down and make smaller sugar molecules that your intestine can absorb. Cinnamon has the ability to prevent these enzymes from working. What I&amp;#39;m trying to tell you is if the complex sugar doesn&amp;#39;t break down, then simple sugar will absorb less sugar. And that? Experts have tested it on humans, given it sugar, and seen what happened to it. With your blood sugar levels . They also gave him meat. They saw that it rose less because it was less absorbed. But cinnamon also has molecules, it has compounds that act very similar to insulin. You know very well that insulin is a hormone that is released by the pancreas, mainly when you eat and when sugar is absorbed, and insulin has the ability to distribute sugar in your body so that it enters the muscles and generates energy to be stored in the liver, etc. There are compounds from the cinnamon plant in this bark that act very similar to insulin and that carry the sugar that is circulating in your blood and that does damage to the muscles, to the liver. I tell you more, cinnamon has another function. Did you know that your liver produces sugar, which, for example, destroys amino acids or other compounds in your body and generates sugar to give you energy? Well, cinnamon can decrease the production of sugar by your liver. Now, how is cinnamon used? How can I use cinnamon every day, doctor? Well, the best way is to distinguish that there are two types of cinnamon, cinnamon, Ceylan and Cassia cinnamon. The one that I am going to recommend that you use is cinnamon. Ceylon. But cassia cinnamon. It is not wrong to use it. The important thing is to know the dosage. You should occupy between 5 to 10 grams per day. That is, you could sprinkle, for example, your cereals. It is very common to eat it with oats. A spectacular cereal. It is very common to add it to coffee. It is very common to sprinkle elsewhere. I also give you another recommendation: you can take the cinnamon sticks and put them in the water. Remember water with rosemary, water with lemon, water with cinnamon. Staying hydrated and taking advantage of these antioxidants is essential. Dr And why the cinnamon? Cascia No, I didn&amp;#39;t say no, you can almost use cinnamon, but it has more components of a toxic substance that if you overdo it can be harmful. So yes, you can occupy Ceylon or if not, always be careful with the dose. Let&amp;#39;s move on to ginseng. Ginseng is a plant that has its root and also has berries. The powerful antioxidants, anti-inflammatories, and other molecules present in ginseng have been studied and may not only improve sugar control, and even studies in diabetics, but may also increase your response. They can keep you more attentive, more awake, more focused. They act very much like coffee. Now, what does ginseng do in sugar? I am going to tell you about ginseng, the root, that there are two types of quinque. Valium. Also called American and Asian called Pan ex ginseng. Both roots are good, and several scientific studies have been done in the laboratory, on animals, and on humans, showing that ginseng works by two main mechanisms. The former, much like cinnamon, can inhibit enzymes that break down complex sugars, make them simple, and allow your body to absorb it. So the absorption of sugar decreases, but it also acts in your intestine, because when the sugar breaks down. Suppose this here is a sugar molecule and it is going to enter your intestine. Suppose this is your gut. There have to be small bridges that allow that sugar to enter your intestine. Ginseng would have the ability to block these bridges, so it would decrease the absorption of sugar much more and, on the other hand, it would also block the production of sugar by the liver. This, when the researchers tested in diabetic patients, showed that sugar levels decreased in the short and medium term and they even saw that the average sugar at 14, 20, 30 days of the patients who took ginseng and this was also seen with the cinnamon decreased. Even the researchers with these, with these two herbs went much further, mainly with cinnamon and saw that it could lower cholesterol and triglycerides. Then see if they will not be interesting. Now, how to use ginseng? Does ginseng have these benefits? If you want, the studies will be carried out with doses of 200 to 400 milligrams once a day. A well compressed tablet. Now, we never really like tablets, especially when your doctor doesn&amp;#39;t recommend it. My recommendation consult with your doctor if perhaps he wants to recommend you consume ginseng and if not, consume small doses of natural ginseng. You probably won&amp;#39;t get all the benefits of ginseng this way. But remember that having a healthy life is not just consuming cinnamon, ginseng or eating a lot of tomato. It has to do with everything, exercise, etc. Ginseng has to be a little careful. I told you, it can keep you awake, keep you focused, help you be more active. You can do a lot of things. The problem is that ginseng gives side effects similar to coffee, irritability, tremors, gastric discomfort. Then do not exceed the daily dose because then you will have the side effects. Let&amp;#39;s continue and I&amp;#39;ll tell you a curiosity. bitter melon. The bitter melon used in India is mainly the so-called natural insulin, because it acts very similar to insulin. There are dozens of studies done on bitter melon that show it has the ability to lower blood sugar. This melon is very promising and very significant studies are being carried out . If you tell me in the comments what part of the world you don&amp;#39;t follow and you want us to talk about bitter melon, I&amp;#39;m going to talk to you more, but I&amp;#39;m interested in his willingness to talk to you more about spinach, tomato and broccoli to not extend the talk too much, because here I put spinach, broccoli and tomato. Well, these three vegetables and others have a special substance called ala, which is called alpha lipoic acid. Alpha lipoic acid is not only a powerful antioxidant and anti-inflammatory, but has been linked to lessening the damage sugar does to your body. Look what I am telling you when you have high sugar in your body, because you are diabetic, because you are diabetic, etc., those sugar molecules that did not enter your muscles, that are elevated in the blood, oxidize, inflame and go depositing in different places of your body, for example in the nerves of the leg. And that is why diabetics eventually have, for example, what is called diabetic neuropathy, in which sugar, the products generated by the oxidation of sugar, damage those nerves and make the signals reach more. So the diabetic&amp;#39;s legs hurt a lot, they feel like electricity, like the scheme or they damage the blood vessels, so they have wounds that don&amp;#39;t heal. Now eat spinach, tomato and broccoli, especially for the wing, has been associated with fewer neurological complications. And I&amp;#39;m talking about neuropathy primarily, as well as a decrease in insulin resistance. You know that diabetics have high sugar for various reasons, because they consume a lot of sugar, because there is a metabolic disturbance that causes the liver to produce more, because insulin cannot work properly, it cannot get sugar into the muscle, for example, because there is resistance, because it is inflamed or because you have little insulin, or because you have enough, but not for what your body needs. Well, these three vegetables and others that have a soul you can investigate on your own. They can improve insulin resistance, which leads to a decrease in blood sugar and an improvement in your parameters. Note that I am telling you that you can improve diabetes, control your sugar and even if you are a normal person and. Are you worried about being diabetic? You can have a healthier life by eating vegetables. It&amp;#39;s not science. It is every day to incorporate different vegetables, exercise, take care of your body. I&amp;#39;m also going to talk to you quickly and two words from chrome milk thistle. And finally, I am going to tell you how you should include this in your diet. Milk thistle. We know very little about milk thistle, we know that it lowers sugar like cinnamon, but there are not enough studies for me to comment on it. As soon as those studies come out. I am going to tell you now if we know that sugar drops a little, but we do not know what happens in the long term. We don&amp;#39;t know what happens if you are diabetic. Regarding chrome. A fundamental mineral, this mineral. When there is a deficit in your body, when you have low chromium, it is related to an increase in blood sugar. See what I&amp;#39;m trying to tell you. Only when you lack chromium do you increase sugar. So, if you have enough chromium, I don&amp;#39;t need to supplement you. If you eat these vegetables, you will have enough chromium. If you eat varied foods of different colors, you eat well. You shouldn&amp;#39;t be missing chrome. People who lack chromium are generally patients who have, for example, digestive diseases or kidney diseases. And if chromium is down, it would be a good idea to supplement to prevent sugar from rising, among other disorders. In summary, do not use chromium without consulting your doctor and without having low levels or a clear indication why you will not have benefits? Doctor, how do I use this in the diet? How every day Spinach I use every day Cinnamon cut a piece of ginseng and how I don&amp;#39;t use one thing or another on different days. For example, do not consume sugar with your coffee, or with your oatmeal, or with anything. Replace the sugar with cinnamon. Cinnamon is a sweet that if you get used to it over time, it is a sweet that has antioxidants, anti-inflammatories and that lowers sugar instead of consuming sugar. If you consume cinnamon you will improve your weight, you will feel better, you will deflate, you will control your sugar better. Then the sugar replacement uses cinnamon, for example ginseng. Ginseng teas are delicious and if your doctor suggests it, supplement spinach, tomato, broccoli, make salads, broccoli. We all know the power of broccoli. For example, the tomato eaten with the peel. Remember that there are many such benefits. Spinach has an impressive amount of iron. Consume different vegetables every day and always remember to drink enough water. Now, this is not enough to keep your sugar controlled. You must lose weight and you must exercise every day. And one more thing to keep stress at bay, sleeping well, taking relaxation time, getting away from your cell phone after work. We would very much like to know from which part of the world you follow us and I hope you have found this talk useful and informative. I send you a big hug from our part of the world. Bye Bye.",

In this video I will tell you 11 good and cheap elements that help control blood sugar that you should pay attention to and include in your diet and I have included here the foods that have a good price, those foods that you can find easily and also you can buy them that are cheap and number one is the egg the egg is an excellent food before you ask if the egg increases cholesterol this is a big myth the egg is good for cholesterol it can even increase HDR levels is that I I&amp;#39;m talking about the egg being the white and the yolk, many people think that you have to remove the yolk because it contains fat, but this fat is a good type of fat as well as being a source of protein which is excellent for diabetics for maintaining muscle mass and also for increasing from the muscles, which is very good for controlling blood sugar, the egg can also improve cognition, memory, vision, it has several vitamins, minerals, so there was an excellent food for diabetics Oh, but those who have kidney problems were told that they can&amp;#39;t eat eggs, that too It&amp;#39;s a lie, it&amp;#39;s something that was said for many , many years, but the consumption of proteins is not contraindicated, on the contrary, it is recommended for people who have kidney problems because you also need proteins to survive Of course, if you consume too much protein, you will ingest 12 15 eggs a day, yes, it will be bad, okay, but here I&amp;#39;m talking about consuming one to two eggs a day, there&amp;#39;s no problem with your kidneys, that&amp;#39;s actually good for your metabolism, okay, that&amp;#39;s a big myth that has problem, yes , you can&amp;#39;t consume protein, you can&amp;#39;t or excess protein combined number 2 and one of the best foods in the world not only for those with diabetes but also for those who don&amp;#39;t have diabetes, this food here reduces the risk of heart attack and is very important. olive oil is very beneficial for your health Ah, but olive oil is expensive, it shouldn&amp;#39;t be on this list, that &amp;#39;s also not true because the dose of olive oil for you to have the benefits from a cardiovascular point of view reduces stroke for example, stroke or even a heart attack As I mentioned, it&amp;#39;s 7 ml per day, what is that, I&amp;#39;m going to talk about it in spoons, one person said this, oh in the next video it talks about spoons, which is easier to understand, so what would seven ml be? of olive oil, if it&amp;#39;s a tablespoon, it&amp;#39;s half a tablespoon a day, if it&amp;#39;s a teaspoon, it&amp;#39;s one and a half teaspoons, which would last around 7 months, although the average soup is 15 ml and a teaspoon is 5 ml so to give 7 you have to do this calculation as I taught you, ok, many people say it&amp;#39;s expensive because they exaggerate the dose. I remember that once I went to a colleague of mine. That was last year, he asked if I liked omelets, so I said I&amp;#39;m going to make one here for you and olive oil if you like it, I also said you can&amp;#39;t add olive oil, which I like, when my omelette dish arrived, the omelette was floating in the olive nets, this type of consumption, besides being expensive, because you&amp;#39;re using a certain amount. absurd amount of olive oil, I don&amp;#39;t know how much there was, I didn&amp;#39;t measure it, but at first there was about 200 ml, there&amp;#39;s a lot of olive oil, I couldn&amp;#39;t believe it and I&amp;#39;ve seen a lot of people do it too and besides being expensive, it&amp;#39;s going to be bad for your health because the axes Olive, despite being healthy, is very high in calories, if you consume an excess of calories it will worsen insulin resistance, it will worsen the whole process of blood sugar metabolism and it will increase even more so you have to be careful with the dose if you consume 7 ml of olive oil will be good for your heart it will be good for diabetes and it won&amp;#39;t be expensive If you buy a liter for example 7ml It&amp;#39;s almost enough for six months so it&amp;#39;s very interesting to consume extra virgin olive oil a lot of people ask too about lard lard is not healthy for diabetics it has a high amount of saturated fat a different fat is found in olive oil and also the eyes soybean oil sunflower oil when compared to olive oil olive is better than all of them combined number three citrus fruits like lemon orange acerola I really like acerola And how can you consume lemon for example you can put it in food because it has several vitamins you can season the food in this case, right You can using it as juice can make flavored water so there are several ways you can use lemon I really like drinking water with lemon I add a slice of lemon it leaves a flavored water it&amp;#39;s very good and it also yields a lot here you&amp;#39;re interested it&amp;#39;s worth it a lot of people say So, ah, but lemon is not a miracle worker. Of course, none of these foods here will be a cure for diabetes. I&amp;#39;m not saying that, I&amp;#39;m talking about foods that have the potential to help, along with other measures to control blood sugar. Alright, then. This story that one element is only healing, one food will only do wonders, this is all a lie, don&amp;#39;t believe this talk that this doesn&amp;#39;t exist, okay, diabetes control is a series of measures that you take every day to get the result, so lemon orange also if you consume orange eat with pomace it&amp;#39;s always good with the fiber because this helps with the absorption of sugar and reduces the glycemic index of the food when you digest it it doesn&amp;#39;t cause that spike in blood sugar and you also don&amp;#39;t need to take a Picolino which is very interesting acerola you can also eat acerola juice it&amp;#39;s good you have to be careful here with the juices ok so orange juice is not good for diabetics because you end up removing the fibers and that sugar that remains the fruit sugar it is very concentrated and the glycemic index also increases because it does not have fiber, so orange juice, even if whole, is not interesting if it is lemon juice or acerola juice. Then yes, it could be because it has a glycemic load, a smaller amount of sugar than the other fruits, I&amp;#39;m going to leave an asterisk here for citrus fruits, which is about pineapple, despite being a very good fruit, you have to be a little careful because it has a glycemic load, a greater amount of sugar than other citrus fruits and it also has a higher glycemic index So you have to be careful with the quantity, not that it is prohibited, you don&amp;#39;t have to avoid it completely if you like it, but you have to be careful with the quantity of pineapple number 4 and this is also the best food in the world, which is chia, I will put it together Here, flaxseed, this type of food, is very rich in fiber and fiber delays the absorption of carbohydrates, in addition to helping society, you will eat less, so chia and flaxseed should be included in your diet, even if you always have diverticula, people comment on That&amp;#39;s it, I have diverticula, can I use flaxseed? Not only can you, but you should because these foods, fiber, in addition to reducing the risk of colorectal bowel cancer, also protects you from having a diverticulitis attack, they protect your intestine, so chia and flaxseed are great foods Oh, but what if I have it at the moment? Like the acute diverticulitis crisis, then yes, you will have to make a series of restrictions, among these restrictions, you will have to avoid consuming Sheila in steel, but only in this circumstance, if you have diverticula, this is not a contraindication , make it very clear here, beauty, you can use it calmly, this has already been studied, it&amp;#39;s not my opinion, there are scientific studies that report the safety of these fibers, chia for example, also has a type of fat that can improve your cholesterol, which is a good fat in addition to reducing the absorption of sugars and reducing the glycemic index of a meal, for example, making you have better digestion and being more satiated and eating less, many people ask about oats if you compare oats with flour, for example, white flour, oats it&amp;#39;s better, but if you compare the vein cuxia with linseed, it&amp;#39;s worth choosing chia and linseed because oats, despite also having fiber, also have this function in the intestine. The vein is rich in carbohydrates and sugars, but about half of the composition of the vein is 65% is carbohydrates and when you eat carbohydrates your body transforms a large part of them into sugar so even if you don&amp;#39;t put sugar in your veins as I&amp;#39;ve been told Oh but just like it is well don&amp;#39;t add sugar don&amp;#39;t add honey for example just for you consuming oats you will already be ingesting more carbohydrates that your body will later transform into sugar so if you have the possibility to choose, choose chia and flaxseed beauty number 5 before I say number 5 I want to ask you if you are liking this video if yes click on like if you think this video is relevant because this way the system understands that the video is good that it has important information here As in fact it does and ends up spreading it to more people So our goal in today&amp;#39;s video It&amp;#39;s going to be 11 thousand likes, the goal of 10 thousand likes is already behind us, now it&amp;#39;s 11 thousand, okay, let&amp;#39;s continue with list number 5 and another excellent food for diabetics, fish. Because fish are sources of protein and also good fats, they are two of the best things for diabetics to control blood sugar So it&amp;#39;s worth including fish in your diet and here I&amp;#39;m not going to restrict just tuna and salmon because in many regions this is expensive I&amp;#39;m talking here in the video elements that are cheap so consume the fish that you have access to if it is Harem that many people like sardines cod see what fish is available in your region if you consume it you will be consuming a source of lean protein which is very good for diabetics of course if you have access to salmon and tuna has more studies for omega 3 in protecting the heart, which is also interesting for diabetics but I&amp;#39;m not going to limit it here just to these fish number 6 avocado there are several studies with avocado because avocado is low in carbohydrates and rich in good fats mono unsaturated which also help with cholesterol, just to give you an idea, a portion of avocado of around 120 g, this will have an average of two to three carbohydrates, which is very interesting for Diabetes because it will not increase your blood sugar. remember that I talked about olive oils, so the same goes for avocado, it is an extremely healthy food but it is high in calories, so if you consume a portion of 100 to 120 grams per day you will be doing good for your health and you will not eat too much of calories number 7 red colored fruits such as strawberry cherry red apple is also very interesting for diabetics these fruits have a low glycemic index and a glistema load amount of carbohydrates also lower watermelon many ask can a diabetic consume watermelon Yes yes watermelon, despite having a higher glycemic index than the other fruits I mentioned, has a load, it has a lower amount of carbohydrates than the others, it can indeed be consumed and you often wonder what the glycemic index is that I like I speak and if glycemic when you eat a food is how much this food will increase your blood sugar that is what glycemic index means Okay so when you eat watermelon it has the potential to increase it a little more than other fruits but as it has a lower amount of carbohydrates, a smaller amount of sugar per serving. So it is also good for diabetics. In addition to the fact that 90% of watermelon is made up of water, you are also treated. So yes, you can eat watermelon. The red fruits are rich in antioxidants that combat free radicals are rich in anti-inflammatory substances there are several studies that show the benefits of red fruits that diabetics cannot eat fruit it is a big myth you can not only but you should it is not the fructose that is harmful but the excess fructose So yes it will increase your blood sugar but you can eat fruit in a relaxed way, well rested, it will be good for your health, just take it or not overdo it number 8 legumes I will highlight beans here because they are also a source of protein, although beans are also it has carbohydrates it is rich in fiber in proteins it is a great food and it is also cheap which other legumes are also good excellent I will put this word here to be more emphatic radish I also really like eggplant and here I am talking about you eating it is eggplant okay with fiber this can help control your blood sugar because it is rich in fiber there is a type of fiber that is very good for diabetics and I&amp;#39;m not talking about eggplant juice here . it is very good for diabetics broccoli another legume that is excellent for diabetics and here You ask a lot, is it true that broccoli, cauliflower, cruciferous vegetables harm the thyroid No, it is not true, there are several studies that showed that the consumption of broccoli is safe, in addition to not harming the thyroid, it is good for your body, it is a source of several nutrients And why do so many people say this, there was a study on rats that the rats only ate broccoli and eat flowers, I only ate one cruciferous fruit and these rats developed business and hormonal problems what I can do is when the thyroid gets big so these rats that only ate broccoli had problems when these studies were done on humans this didn&amp;#39;t happen because you won&amp;#39;t eat just broccoli every day three four kilos of broccoli isn&amp;#39;t it, so you can eat it very calmly, well rested, it won&amp;#39;t harm your thyroid, it will be good for your health number 9 this one I also really like cashew nuts Brazil nuts pistachios macadamia hazelnuts almonds are excellent foods that have anti-aging potential . -inflammatory and also help with blood sugar control because they are low in carbohydrates, sugars and also have a type of good fat that can help with your cholesterol only here also these foods that are rich in good fats they end up being more lime So there is that being careful with the quantity, two walnuts a day, for example, or two chestnuts would be enough for you to get several nutrients such as selenium, zinc, which help with your metabolism, they are essential even for thyroid function. So they are great foods, number 10, coffee, I&amp;#39;m a I&amp;#39;m a big fan of coffee, I drink coffee every day, coffee is a food that has anti-inflammatory potential and there are studies that were very interesting and I&amp;#39;m going to tell you here that he compared people who drank coffee up to four cups, it was 200ml, it&amp;#39;s very important to say in the dose and compared with people who didn&amp;#39;t drink it and people who drank coffee had a 33% lower chance of developing type 2 diabetes than those who didn&amp;#39;t drink it, so coffee is a protective factor from a metabolic point of view, many people talk about the dose, I said there of the four cups So up to 4 cups of 200 ml or if it is espresso coffee up to 4 doses of 50 ml because each dose each cup of coffee has around 100 mg of caffeine and the safe dose of caffeine would be up to 400 mg per day I already made a specific video about coffee then I&amp;#39;ll leave a recommendation for you let&amp;#39;s just finish our list here number 11 and our last food our last type of food are Green Leaves like lettuce arugula kale spinach so excellent for diabetics in addition to being good cheap foods that help your metabolism and are sources of nutrients how many foods you consume decisions write in the comments and also rate this video from 0 to 10 because if it is 10 I will make more videos like this from which part of the world you are you watching this video about which city I&amp;#39;m talking about Porto Alegre Put your city here in the comments that I always like to read now I&amp;#39;m going to leave a suggestion for you to watch it&amp;#39;s a video that I talked about vegetables did you know that there are vegetables that you should be careful if you are diabetic in this video here I explain about it I talk about the best and worst vegetables for those with diabetes I&amp;#39;m sure you&amp;#39;ll like it it will also be useful a hug until next time",

    "transcript": "James Co I&amp;#39;m diabetic have high blood pressure 54 year old black guy what I need to be taken to get under seven um to get under seven we have a new diabetic support product called doctor&amp;#39;s diabetic support uh uh glucose sugar support uh that will help that as far as getting your blood sugar down but the hemoglobin A1c is what you&amp;#39;re talking about uh at 7 when you have high blood pressure and diabetes you have What&amp;#39;s called the metabolic syndrome it&amp;#39;s really three dise diseases high blood pressure high cholesterol and diabetes so those three things form a pyramid and that pyramid is balanced if you have to treat each of those disease states to keep your pyramid straight if you treat one but you don&amp;#39;t treat the others you see how it skewes the pyramid so every visit that you go to the doctor all three of those disease Stakes need to be addressed so you need to be on a cholesterol Lo medication if you are not already need to be on an effective regimen to control your blood pressure which may be two medicines three medicines with diabetes it may require more than three it&amp;#39;s however many it takes but that treatment regimen should include a drug in the class of angiotensin receptor blockers or ACE inhibitors they protect the kidneys from damage that happens to the kidneys from the diabetes diabetes is number one cause of people going into renal failure and going on dialysis so that class of drug is a must for a person that has a diagnosis of diabetes then whatever other class of drugs is required to control your blood pressure the most common would be uh calcium channel blockers uh such as nyine or amlodipine uh those in combination with an ace or an AR and then you throw in a diuretic a my dose of diuretic hydrog Glide is the most common those three things are at minimum what you should need to be on you can get that you can get you can get all three of them in one pill uh but uh most insurance companies won&amp;#39;t cover it so that you might have to get two pill to get that objective then major breakthroughs in the treatment of diabetes you have the sglt2 Inhibitors which would be Fara and jaran then you have the gp1s which would be mararo and OIC so you should be on at least one of those drugs or possibly uh the sglt2 and the uh glp1 uh to control uh and get great control of your diabetes that will lower your hemoglobin 1C and get under seven uh continuously keep you under seven it stop you from getting on insulin if you&amp;#39;re on insulin that combination could result in you coming off of insulin I take patients off of insulin all the time by using those two drugs uh sometimes you still have to stay on insulin but at a much lower dose and much less complicated regimen most of the time just a basil insulin like lanis lantis or basil GL will give you all the the the insulin that you need versus taking metime insulin which would be Humalog and novalog every time you eat and then taking the basil insulin maybe even in the morning in the evening so people can take as few as one insulin shot and some people take as much as seven but I can assure you that that treatment regimen that I just recommended with the sglt TOs that would be Fara and or jaran not and I&amp;#39;m sorry it&amp;#39;s either or Fara or Jans and they found great benefit to prevention of heart attacks and strokes as as well as helping improve kidney function with that class of drugs when the drugs were first invented because what they do is make you urinate out the sugar not only do you urinate out the sugar you urinate out the calories associated with the sugar so it makes you lose weight and guess what it&amp;#39;s glucose dependent which means that when your sugar normalizes it cuts itself off so you can&amp;#39;t get low blood sugar from that class of drug but you can&amp;#39;t get very well controlled diabetes blood sugar levels so great job with that and then of course the Magic The Magic of the OIC or the mro either one of those uh very good we can get you on the seven with no problem you have to follow the regimen uh which includes a a a diabetic diet that&amp;#39;s low carb so you&amp;#39;re not eating sugar all the time doesn&amp;#39;t mean you can&amp;#39;t ever have a piece of cake or that you can&amp;#39;t you just can&amp;#39;t have cake and ice cream and donuts all day every day okay James great question",

    "transcript": "welcome to another episode of gjan talks we all know that amons are a super healthy snack but I still get a lot of questions about them so today we have a very special guest Elena Helmer she is the associate director of nutrition research at the Armond board of California and I decided to ask her all the doubts many of us have about alans right from their nutrition benefits to their role in weight management I also asked Elena about the best way to consume almonds should we eat them raw or soaked how many almonds should we eat every day and is soaking really necessary apart from this we also busted some surprising myths and facts you probably didn&amp;#39;t know so if you want to learn how to get maximum health benefits from alons then this episode is for you now let&amp;#39;s dive into it hi everyone so meet Elena she is the associate director of uh nutrition research at Arman board of California it&amp;#39;s a pleasure to have you on this show today thank you so much for taking our time happy to be here so you know what in India alond is more than just a dry fruit it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s an emotion because uh people in India they gift dry fruits to each other on occasions like Diwali children in India eat almond every morning before they go to the school so that&amp;#39;s the importance of almans in India yeah that&amp;#39;s wonderful what what are the different um you know benefits one can get when they eat almonds every day yeah very good question so almonds are one of the most researched Foods in the world we have over 200 peer-reviewed Publications on the nutrition and health benefits of almonds wow and this body of research really spans many different Health areas um I would say the most kind of foundational established area of the Almond research is how almonds can benefit your heart health um a lot of lot of data showing that eating almonds every day can help improve cholesterol levels um among many different populations is it because of the monounsaturated fat the healthy fat it has almonds are chalk full of really healthy monounsaturated fats they also contain polyunsaturated fats and these types of fats are very beneficial for heart health as well as many different Health areas um we also have a very large body of research on the blood sugar regulation effects of almonds um our research we have a lot of research specific to an Indian context showing that almonds can be very beneficial to help people with pre-diabetes with overweight and obesity and managing their blood sugar um we also have a large body of evidence on the weight management effects of almonds um showing that eating almonds every day can really be a beneficial tool to help in managing weight um and help with feeling full and having a lot of energy okay so you said diabetes diabetes is currently a big thing in India yes unfortunately India is now called as diabetic capital of the world and you said that alans can actually help with the diabetes so my first question is is it like okay for someone who has diabetes or can it also help to manage or reverse diabetes yes so we&amp;#39;ve done a number of different studies in India in different geographic regions of India and also among different population groups people with type 2 diabetes people with pre-diabetes people with overweight and obesity who don&amp;#39;t have diabetes and among youth at risk for diabetes so we have seen among all these population groups that almonds can be beneficial in regulating um different metabolic factors um things like weight um different um measures of blood glucose so I would say you know among our studies looking at people with type 2 diabetes we see that almonds are a helpful dietary strategy to manage the condition but we&amp;#39;ve also seen among populations with pre-diabetes that hasn&amp;#39;t fully progressed to diabetes almonds were actually beneficial in about a quarter of the people studied um reversing pre-diabetic blood sugar regulation back to normal healthy blood sugar regulation and all of these studies were done um in an Indian context oh okay great because in diabetes in India in an Indian context for that matter is very different because it&amp;#39;s mostly because of the lifestyle the culture the habits so diabetes in India is mostly because of all these reasons yes so I&amp;#39;m glad that whatever information you&amp;#39;re sharing is coming from the studies on Indian standpoint that makes more much more because the background diet is different um in different even in different parts of India we see that there&amp;#39;s really different dietary patterns you also mentioned almonds are good for weight management yes however at the same time almonds are also high in calories like um just a handful or one serving 1 ounce of almonds which is close to what how many grams uh 28 G 28 is one serving one handful of almond so 28 gr of almond contains close to 160 170 calories and then at the same time we say it also helps in weight management so how is that because something which is so much nutritionally dense and high on calories how can a food like that helps to manage weight I mean I really want to know this from you yes yeah it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s a great question because I think there is a myth about not just almonds but about nuts and foods that are high in fat in general that they cause weight gain and this is really not true based on the body of scientific evidence we have seen that many foods that contain these mono and polyunsaturated fatty acids can actually be really beneficial for for preventing weight gain okay and in the case of almonds you know although yeah one serving of almonds does have 160 calories we do see in many many different studies from India and from all around the world that when people are eating a handful of almonds a day it&amp;#39;s very filling it&amp;#39;s very satiating and they tend to eat less of other Foods so we see this effect of dietary compensation where they&amp;#39;re actually compensating for many of the calories that they are eating with almonds by eating less of other Foods okay in addition um the the structure of the almonds um a lot of the fat and the calories are are kind of sequestered in the cell wall of the Almond so there we do have research showing that when people eat a whole almond they don&amp;#39;t actually absorb all of the calories you only actually absorb about 75% of those 160 calories so there&amp;#39;s a few different um kind of mechanistic reasons why we see in every single study that we do you can give people almonds and they will not gain weight in fact we actually have seen that um in many situations eating almonds can help produce a small weight loss mhm so where does that the remaining 30% calories Go I mean that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s very exciting to know that only 70% of the calories actually get absorbed by the body but then how about the rest of 30% excreted from the body okay okay all right so 70% is the one that gets consumed like 7 about 75% we&amp;#39;ve seen in our research that you know the calories actually on the label of almonds are they a calculation that&amp;#39;s done based on the amount of protein and fat um and the carbohydrates in the almonds but we&amp;#39;ve seen that actually when you study the amount of calories that are actually absorbed into the body it is lower than the amount calculated that you would expect based on the label okay so um you said protein I know almond is a good source of like it&amp;#39;s a good plant-based protein and um I guess one serving contains close to what 6 G of prot of protein oh that&amp;#39;s wonderful because that&amp;#39;s equal equal to an egg the kind of protein that egg contains it&amp;#39;s a complete profile all nine essential amino acids however almonds the kind of protein or the quality of protein that contain it it&amp;#39;s not complete protein so what you would like what would you like to say on that yeah so like many plant-based sources of protein like most other nuts yeah almonds don&amp;#39;t have all nine essential amino acids in the required amounts to be considered a compl compl protein however most people are actually eating plenty of protein and are getting all of their amino acids that they need so I don&amp;#39;t think of this as a major concern for almonds you know pairing plant-based protein sources makes it very easy to get all of the amino acids in the required amounts that you need them um so for example you know pairing almonds with a legume or another type of plant-based protein Source really ensures that you&amp;#39;re getting all those amino acids and again most people throughout the day are getting plenty of protein and all of their amino acids so it&amp;#39;s not not a big concern for the general population okay okay so protein uh in the almonds is also helping with Muscle Recovery so I believe it it can also be considered as a very good post-workout snack is it yes yeah we actually do have um a few studies showing that almonds are really a great snack for post exercise recovery so after you do strenuous exercise um there some muscle damage associated with that there&amp;#39;s some post exercise inflammation so it&amp;#39;s really important to eat foods that have a lot of anti-inflammatory benefits that can really help with that post exercise recovery and we have seen from three research studies that almonds can help in reducing that post exercise soreness and pain and fatigue oh wow that&amp;#39;s wonderful that&amp;#39;s wonderful and it also is a very good source of energy so it can also be eaten before the workout so that you get like a good boost of energy and can perform better with your exercises right exactly amazing so one nut which can be eaten as a pre-workout both I mean both as a pre-workout and as a post-workout that&amp;#39;s amazing yes definitely wonderful like another quality of almond which I want to talk with you is um the skin benefits you know I also heard that it helps in reducing wrinkles acne so what is that like is it really can we really take consume almond as an anti-aging snack and we call it like that yes so there&amp;#39;s a lot of evidence that eating a healthy diet is beneficial for your skin health and actually the appearance of your skin wow um which I think is is really fascinating so we have done a few studies on almonds looking at consumption of almonds and um Improvement of facial wrinkles and Fine Lines among postmenopausal women so we have we have seen a benefit um you know it makes sense there&amp;#39;s a lot of antioxidants and different bioactive compounds and almonds that you would expect could improve the appearance of your skin um so we we do have a few studies actually showing um some beauty benefits of almonds but what I really like about those studies is if people are eating almonds let&amp;#39;s say they&amp;#39;re motivated by the beauty benefit they&amp;#39;re also going to get the heart health and the blood sugar and the weight and all of those cardiometabolic benefits as well so it&amp;#39;s a great a good reason to eat allmond so many good reason what what&amp;#39;s your favorite reason to we T oh that&amp;#39;s a that&amp;#39;s a great question I mean I I really really like the exercise recovery aspect I&amp;#39;m very active I I do a lot of weightlifting and so I I make sure that after I work out and and just every day that I&amp;#39;m eating foods like almonds that are really really high in antioxidants and that can counteract some of that muscle inflammation wonderful okay great so as I told you that in India is just more than a nut more than a dry fruit uh I remember that as a child my mother would always want me or rather force me to eat common saying that it&amp;#39;s good for your memory it&amp;#39;s good for your brain&amp;#39;s Health it&amp;#39;s actually considered as a food for brain so does it really help in improving cognitive functions like memory like concentration are there any studies which supports this fact we do have an ongoing study in India right now looking at almonds and cognitive performance um with with Dr an mra&amp;#39;s lab so I will definitely keep you posted on those results but almonds are a source of um zinc and they&amp;#39;re a source of iron both are which are nutrients that are known to help with cognitive performance okay and I know yeah for centuries in India almonds have really been touted for their their health benefits through ayurveda which I think is really interesting because we are seeing now kind of in the in the modern clinical research a lot of these health benefits that have been called out for centuries in traditional Indian medicine we are seeing these coming Delight in um in the modern clinical research okay and alond supports gut health as well yes we do have a lot of research indicating that almonds um may have a Prebiotic effect so they may be selectively utilized by the beneficial bacteria in your gut um which can which is related to health effects all around your body wonderful so I remember that I was um I saw this um sticker somewhere in your office which had a list of alond benefits from head to toe yes I mean that was really fascinating from head to I mean that&amp;#39;s a very different way to look at it yes yeah so we discussed so many good health benefits of amons let&amp;#39;s now talk about how can people actually take the most out of it for which I want to discuss with you what is the right way to consume arm all right so first of all let&amp;#39;s start with what according to you is the right quantity yes that one should consume in a day so in most of our research studies we look at at least one serving of almonds a day so again that&amp;#39;s 28 G about 23 almonds MH um you know we&amp;#39;ve we&amp;#39;ve done research on one serving on two servings on three we do see that more is better the health effects tend to increase the more that you eat um but I think you know one handful a day is is an attainable goal um for most people to shoot for So when you say a handful of fans what is the right age group for this quantity like I&amp;#39;m sure it cannot be the same for a child and for an older person or a young person and then there are different Lifestyles also so what like this amount one serving which is 28 GRS it is ideal for whom so we actually have done research on many different population groups including adolescent young adults um older adults and we do we do look at at least one serving a day okay um so we don&amp;#39;t have super tailored recommendations for based on age range um we do see benefits and all age groups um at that at least one serving a day H okay and when is the best time to consume ons so in many of yeah in many of our studies we like to leave it flexible because every every person is different and people may like to eat almonds at different times or in different ways you know some people want to eat them all at once as a snack some people may want to sprinkle it on their oatmeal or in their salads so we tend to try to leave it flexible I would say almonds are such a healthy food at any time of day like whatever works for the individual&amp;#39;s preferences all right so unlike many other Foods there is no restriction like you cannot have it at the start of your day or just before bed you can have it literally anytime we we&amp;#39;ve studied at many different times and we see positive effects okay okay all right so you said one serving or maybe more is even better how long like how what is the time it will take for someone to keep consuming alons with consistency to actually start seeing the results the benefits that we discussed yeah it&amp;#39;s a really good question so in our research studies they range anywhere from a very acute study looking over a number of hours to up to a year so we have a very very wide range of durations of our research you know we do see a lot of our studies will look at um people eating almonds over 4 weeks 8 weeks 12 weeks you know that&amp;#39;s when we do start to see some of the longer week is the minimum minimum duration that it depends on the health outcome that you&amp;#39;re looking at like if you&amp;#39;re looking at a very acute outcome like satiety you know sometimes we look at that over a number of hours um so people eat almonds and you know instantly they feel energized they feel more full but if you&amp;#39;re looking at something like um your LDL cholesterol we typically would do a study over 12 weeks CU it really takes it takes that that much time time to see an um Improvement in that type of clinical marker makes sense we also hear that it&amp;#39;s always better to soak your almonds before eating is it like really important to soak almonds and then eat them or does it like not make any difference so in our research studies we always look at raw almonds with their skin on or roasted almonds with their skin on um we have looked at kind of lightly salted roasted almonds um we don&amp;#39;t typically do research on on soaked almonds with the peel off okay I will say you&amp;#39;re getting all you&amp;#39;re getting the nutrients in the Almond if you&amp;#39;re eating it soaked with the peel off if you&amp;#39;re eating it raw um so I think again whatever the individual prefers and whatever is going to make it more likely that they&amp;#39;ll actually eat the almonds is what I would recommend because you&amp;#39;re getting this really nutritious product in no matter the form that you eat of it so it doesn&amp;#39;t really matter there&amp;#39;s a large body of evidence on raw almonds with their skin on and their health benefits um or roasted and their health benefits so I have heard this myth um in my travels to India that the skin is bad that you need to remove the skin that is actually untrue there are a lot of really really wonderful um healthy bioactive compounds in the skin and the fiber as well yes and fiber so I think that notion of you can&amp;#39;t eat the skin that is incorrect um but again if people want to soak and remove the skin and they prefer to eat almonds that way they&amp;#39;re still getting all the nutrition in the in the kernel okay okay so what is it about the ftic acid I mean the reasoning that I read of behind soaking almond is that when you soak them all the phytic acid and the other anti nutrients uh you know which does not let the other nutrients get absorbed into the body are removed which is they soak and they remove the PE so it&amp;#39;s not true so the the issue with anti-nutrients there there are these quote unquote anti-nutrients like phytic acid in in many different plant-based Foods it&amp;#39;s not just almonds in in many you know beans and other nuts and leafy greens and the overwhelming body of evidence on these healthy plant Foods is that they cause very significant health benefits there&amp;#39;s really no evidence that these foods are harmful so I think think it&amp;#39;s a bit reductionist to look to focus on these specific nutrients in almonds because if you look at the whole almond you look at the package of the nutrients that you&amp;#39;re getting you&amp;#39;re getting an incredibly healthy food and it doesn&amp;#39;t make sense to focus on kind of one one specific component of that you need to look at the overall healthy package and if you look at the overall body of evidence there are significant health benefits from eating almonds and we&amp;#39;ve never seen any issues related to these quote unquote anti- nutrients H thank you for clearing that out is there any difference in the nutrition profile when we roast or toast the almonds or we eat them raw or we soak them and then eat them like we&amp;#39;ve discussed about soaking and eating but roasting toasting versus eating them raw yeah so when you roast the Almond that process of applying heat does you know in in a in a minor way does change some of the nutritional composition but it doesn&amp;#39;t it doesn&amp;#39;t really change the health effects that we see okay yeah it just enhances the taste the uh the I would say the the Crunch and everything else right yes yeah it just changes The Taste um I I I love roasted almonds I eat a lot of dry roasted almonds we do research on dry roasted on Raw um it&amp;#39;s really just about what yeah what does the individual prefer um okay okay how to store almonds to increase the shelf life so fortunately almonds do have a very long shelf life um we&amp;#39;re unique in that regard a lot of plant foods have a a very short shelf life um when I buy almonds I do store them in an airtight container in the refrigerator okay um oh you refrigerate your almonds I do yes regardless of the weather the season yes because almonds they do they do um contain oil which can oxidize again and you know the time frame for oxid for oxidizing is very long so usually I will have eaten all my almonds before before they could go bad or go rancid um but I do to to um ensure maximum freshness I do store them in a airtight container in the refrigerator okay okay almond milk has exploded in the last couple of years in India uh what do you like think is almond milk a better option than the dairy based or the animal based milk yeah it it depends on what the consumer is looking for I personally drink almond milk because it is much lower calorie than dairy milk and I like to add it to my smoothies to my oatmeal um it also has nutrients at the same level of dairy milk when it comes to calcium and um and vitamin D and kind of those really important nutrients of Public Health concern um so it&amp;#39;s really up to the individual but I think almond milk is a very a nice versatile way to add some nutrients to your diet with a very low calorie count and I feel it&amp;#39;s a little lighter on stomach also it&amp;#39;s easier to digest it&amp;#39;s not that heavy and of course people with intolerances can easily consume lactose intolerance yeah it&amp;#39;s a great option for people with lactose intolerance right right right okay cool so next I have is like some very quick questions it&amp;#39;s like a rapid fire so I&amp;#39;ll just ask you some questions and you may just just feel free to answer them in a word or in a sentence as you feel like okay okay okay so the biggest misconcept you hear about dos what we talked about about the skin being harmful and these quote unquote like anti-nutrients in almonds that is a big misconception the skin is very beneficial there&amp;#39;s actually a lot of really really important nutrients in almonds um so I wouldn&amp;#39;t be concerned at all about any of these kind of anti-nutrients okay so what&amp;#39;s one surprising fact about almonds which most people don&amp;#39;t know I&amp;#39;ll point to the skin health benefits I find that um kind of the most surprising um research findings that actually eating almonds can improve the appearance of your skin because all thanks to the vitamin E content in it yeah and just just the overall package of nutrients the healthy fats yeah the antioxidants three mistakes which people make with almond oh that&amp;#39;s a hard one um I think not eating enough is a big mistake okay um you know we have seen that most people around the world are either not eating any almonds or just eating a very very small amount and we do see that a handful a day is really um what what is needed to create some of these great health effects that we saw okay so I would say not eating almonds at all is one not eating enough is another uh can I can I add another one sure so people compl at eating almond a lot like we need to soak them especially in India I&amp;#39;m talking about we need to soak them we need to take the peel off we need to add you know eat this much that much this way that way so I think they complicate eating almonds a lot rather than just eat it and take all the benefits yeah exactly that&amp;#39;s a good point yeah all right so thank you so much it was so insightful and thank you for sharing all the knowledge and Breaking All the myths especially thank you yeah yeah thank you so much for having me this was a fun conversation likewise so guys I hope that you really enjoyed this episode and found it fruitful which is the next food that you would like us to discuss on this show

mackerel into a salad for a high protein meal in minutes when buying mackerel wild Cod is the best option as it has higher omega-3 levels and fewer contaminants compared to farm raised some types like king mackerel have high mercury levels so it&amp;#39;s best to choose Atlantic or Pacific mackerel which are lower in Mercury and safer for regular consumption if buying canned mackerel choose those packed in water or olive oil and avoid versions with added salt or sauces that contain unhealthy additives a simple and delicious diabetes friendly recipe is garlic butter baked mackerel just take a filet drizzle it with olive oil and fresh lemon juice sprinkle with garlic and black pepper and bake it at 375° f 190° c for about 15 minutes another great option is a mackerel and avocado wrap using whole grain tortillas mashed avocado and fresh greens for a nutritious and satisfying meal a research study found that people who regularly consume fatty fish like mackerel had better insulin sensitivity and lower inflammation levels both of which are critical for diabetes management adding mackerel to your diet a few times a week can help stabilize blood sugar support heart health and reduce the risk of diabetes complications eating mackerel regularly is a simple yet powerful way to maintain steady blood sugar protect your heart and boost overall well-being number two tuna is one of the best foods for diabetics offering a powerful combination of high protein essential nutrients and healthy fats that help keep blood sugar levels stable since tuna has zero carbohydrates rates it won&amp;#39;t cause blood sugar spikes making it a smart choice for managing diabetes its high protein content also slows down digestion keeping you full longer and preventing cravings for unhealthy snacks that can lead to glucose fluctuations tuna is rich in essential amino acids that play a key role in metabolism and insulin sensitivity one of these tarine has been linked to improve blood sugar regulation while Lucine helps with muscle maintenance and energy production Arginine supports blood circulation which is especially important for diabetics at risk of poor blood flow these amino acids along with tuna&amp;#39;s natural nutrients contribute to better glucose control and overall metabolic Health since tuna has a glycemic index GI of zero it does not affect blood sugar levels directly when paired with fiber rich foods like vegetables whole grains or legumes tuna helps slow the absorption of glucose into the bloodstream leading to more stable energy levels throughout the day this makes it an excellent food for preventing blood sugar spikes and crashes tuna is also a heart healthy food which is crucial because diabetes increases the risk of heart disease it is rich in omega-3 fatty acids which lower bad cholesterol reduce inflammation and improve circulation Omega-3s also lower blood pressure and may improve insulin sensitivity reducing the risk of complications like strokes and heart attacks research has shown that regular consumption of Omega-3 Rich fish can help people with diabetes manage blood sugar levels more effectively tuna is packed with vitamins and minerals that provide multiple health benefits it is high in vitamin B12 which supports nerve health and energy production and vitamin D which improves insulin sensitivity and bone health the selenium in tuna acts as an antioxidant helping to regulate blood sugar and boost the immune system tuna is also a good source of iron which helps transport oxygen in the blood reducing fatigue and improving energy levels another major benefit is that tuna is low in calories but high in protein a 3.5 ounce 100 gram serving provides about 110 to 130 calories in 25 gram of protein making it an excellent food for weight management because protein takes longer to digest tuna helps keep you full longer preventing overeating and reducing the need for processed foods that can cause blood sugar spikes a

true in this video we&amp;#39;re diving into three Powerhouse fruits that stabilize blood sugar improve insulin function and fight inflammation and one of them even has more vitamin C than an orange

There are several studies, research that classify broccoli as one of the best foods in the world, it&amp;#39;s worth adding broccoli to your salad Ah but I heard that broccoli harms the thyroid, that&amp;#39;s a lie, don&amp;#39;t worry, okay, it wo n&amp;#39;t harm your thyroid . hormonal changes what is a large thyroid goiter but that didn&amp;#39;t happen in humans so it&amp;#39;s a lie that broccoli harms the thyroid coua and flower also you can&amp;#39;t eat it raw if you want it&amp;#39;s fine it&amp;#39;s not even raw it&amp;#39;s bad you can eat it very calmly very carefree number five eggs If you like adding eggs to your salad, it&amp;#39;s also good because you&amp;#39;re adding a little bit of protein and it adds a bit of flavor to the salad. I really like adding eggs to salads. Have you ever done this ? salad suggestion What do you like that you think is healthy write and I will answer if your salad is good or not but if you are crying these nutrients you will do well number four avocado or avocado Bale both here in some regions it is very difficult to find avocado So I&amp;#39;m going to add pineapple too this one is very healthy it has good fats you just have to be careful as it can provide you with excess calories plus a little bit in the salad it&amp;#39;s good it &amp;#39;s also very healthy for diabetics particularly I don&amp;#39;t I like to put avocado or avocado in the salad I don&amp;#39;t think it looks good I don&amp;#39;t think it goes well with avocado in the salad But it&amp;#39;s a matter of opinion, right, there are a lot of people who love it. I&amp;#39;ve seen several recipes with avocado and it&amp;#39;s really healthy if you like it. doing it well will not increase your blood sugar number three watercress watercress is also very healthy if you can add it it will also be good for your health number two cabbage another option for those who are diabetic is taking care of your blood sugar levels and the number one is the radish This is one of the best vegetables because it is low in sugar, has fiber and will not increase your glucose, in addition to providing nutrients, vitamins, minerals These are the 12 best ingredients that you will throw in when preparing your salads and the that you will avoid are nine things so pay close attention because I see I talk to diabetics in practice, you know, as an endocrinologist specializing in diabetes and I see that many make these mistakes and in addition to making mistakes, you know, they do things wrong, thinking that it is right that It&amp;#39;s even worse, there are things you do wrong and you know, don&amp;#39;t wait, I&amp;#39;m doing it wrong, I&amp;#39;m going to have to make up for it with something else, but here it&amp;#39;s a very bad mistake, why? Because you do it wrong thinking it&amp;#39;s right and one of those things, right? nine V start again in descending order number nine is to add a lot of olive oil because olive oil is very caloric What is the dose of olive oil 7 to 10 ml so a small teaspoon a spoon and a half teaspoon for example You&amp;#39;ll be doing good for your health by protecting your heart, you&amp;#39;ll improve your cholesterol levels, but many people add lots and lots of it to salad, but I&amp;#39;ve seen it over and over again, thinking they&amp;#39;re doing good, Oh, I&amp;#39;m not protecting my heart here and it&amp;#39;s there flooding the salad It&amp;#39;s floating in the olive oil, adding several strands of olive oil, OK. Don&amp;#39;t do this until after a certain dose of olive oil, you no longer have any benefit for the heart and you will accumulate a lot of calories because it really It&amp;#39;s caloric, they&amp;#39;re good fats, but they&amp;#39;re fats, right? They&amp;#39;re caloric fats that they will make that whole process of insulin resistance worse. Because you will transform these fats, you will store this in the form of calories and it will increase your fat tissue, lasting your adipose tissue, which will harm even more insulin action. So it is worth limiting the dose of extra virgin olive oil, look, it&amp;#39;s not prohibiting olive oil, I&amp;#39;m not saying that, it&amp;#39;s limiting the dose 7 to 10 ml, you have benefits and no risks, number eight is to add Cheese, those who like salaria with parmesan get more I know, it&amp;#39;s delicious, but you have to avoid adding cheese because you remember what I said at the beginning, you have to avoid bad fats and Parmesan cheeses, for example, have saturated fats. You have to avoid them . If you don&amp;#39;t put it in, you&amp;#39;re doing good for your health, okay, this isn&amp;#39;t the time for you to look for bad fats. Just at salad time, which has to be the healthiest time, well, two things that many people thought were healthy are worth your time . hey, I forgot about the likes goal, I&amp;#39;m going to set the likes goal almost at the end of the video, so 10 likes, if you didn&amp;#39;t like it, still click on like, this helps the video to be distributed, you saw that this topic is really important, many diabetics make mistakes at this point the mistake number of the worst salads consumption of beetroot because beetroot has a higher amount of sugars So you have to limit it, okay, you have to be careful with beetroot Oh but I heard that beetroot has a precursor of nitric oxide that can improve blood pressure Yes, but here I&amp;#39;m talking to diabetics, if you&amp;#39;re diabetic, beetroot has a higher amount of sugars that you&amp;#39;re not looking for at salad time, not that later, if you really want to eat beetroot, if you like it, you can&amp;#39;t eat it, but for salad if you compare it with the list of the best you will see that beetroot has a higher amount of sugars That&amp;#39;s the question, okay, many people ask in the comments that&amp;#39;s why I even put beetroot here ah, but can you beetroot or can&amp;#39;t you? but you have to know that it has a greater amount of sugars number o eight olives olives are rich in sodium which can also increase your blood pressure Have you already seen that you have to control salt and sodium levels and olives also have a lot of fat Oh but It&amp;#39;s a good fat, yes, olives are a type of good fat, right? Even extra virgin olive oil is made from olives, but if you&amp;#39;re taking care of the calorie issue I mentioned, you have to limit the amount of olives, well, there&amp;#39;s no point. adding a lot of olives to the salad makes it more salty because of the sodium issue but it has more calories so olives put an asterisk here I really like olives Okay but if you are diabetic you have to be especially careful with this part of the olives number six Cesar salad sauces, for example, mustarde Mel, who doesn&amp;#39;t like adding it to the salad, it&amp;#39;s the habit of many people, but these sauces, especially these ready-made sauces, if it&amp;#39;s those spicy sauces, then don&amp;#39;t even mention it, you have to avoid it because they have a lot of fat, they are high-calorie sauces, you&amp;#39;re making them In the salad you add mustard and honey and add dressing, you&amp;#39;re making it a bad meal for those with diabetes, also for those trying to lose weight, for those with fat in the liver, for example, you have to avoid sauces Oh, but what am I going to season the salad with? you can use vinegar apple cider vinegar is an option balsamic vinegar I like it a lot I use balsamic vinegar there are several seasonings, you know, with herbs too, but that&amp;#39;s your choice, but these sauces, if they come in sachets, also have to be avoided, okay, because the Fat concentration is very high, not to mention the condiments, right? You&amp;#39;re taking a healthy diet and transforming it into a diet with condiments with a lot of sodium and bad fats, everything you should avoid, you&amp;#39;re putting it on your plate. Okay, so be careful with the sauces. number five that you will avoid are breads, who doesn&amp;#39;t like those crunchy rolls on their salad, many restaurants have these rolls, you also have to take them out, well this is not the time for you to eat bread on your salad, even if it is in small quantities, okay? good Why because your body will take these breads it will turn them into sugar right Many are made from wheat white flour will increase your blood sugar so Those crispy bread rolls take it away it&amp;#39;s also not time for you to eat bread Oh but bread is Same thing that I said is prohibited, right about other foods, I always say here the key is moderation, you have to know when to consume things, nothing prevents you from doing so afterwards, right, if you have controlled blood sugar, you should eat bread with protein. for example, but when it comes to salads, try to be as healthy as possible, okay, because it&amp;#39;s a matter of habit, you&amp;#39;ve also seen that I&amp;#39;ve already given you several options every day, I play with these options and it always works out, so for you, we can give them too, let&amp;#39;s do it a healthy diet starting with salad number four you will avoid is excess salt, right A lot of sodium, a lot of salt Oh, but if it&amp;#39;s Himalayan salt, you also have to avoid pink Himalayan salt, they said it has iron, yes, but it also has sodium, OK, I don&amp;#39;t. I&amp;#39;m saying that you have to avoid salt completely but you have to control the quantity I like to eat my salad without salt but it&amp;#39;s a matter of habit I prefer to add salt to other foods, right, I&amp;#39;m not against salt because we need salt and sodium But what is the dose of salt we consume per day 5 g according to the World Health Organization 5 g is a healthy dose of salt or 2 g of sodium What is the consumption in the United States For example 11 g of salt more than twice as much as recommended in Portugal, also 11 g in Brazil, 10 g a little less but also twice as much as recommended So you have to be easy on the salt Ah, but if it&amp;#39;s sea salt, I take the sea salt and blend it in the blender and then it&amp;#39;s good. It doesn&amp;#39;t stay because there will also be a lot of sodium combined, since I mentioned the issue of salt, don&amp;#39;t come with this story about salt without odor, okay, the salt was enriched with iodine precisely because of the thyroid, OK then, S In the right amount, it&amp;#39;s good for excess is bad, right? It even contributes to increasing the risk of stroke, known as stroke, the third mistake when eating salad is adding corn Ah, but they told me that corn has fiber, yes it has fiber, but it also has carbohydrates. Do you remember that I said to avoid the carbohydrates, sugars at salad time and corn is very rich, it has a very large amount of sugar, carbohydrates and with fiber it is good to avoid at salad time, let&amp;#39;s know it is delicious to put corn on top of the salad but avoid it, the same goes for peas have a little less carbohydrates but also when making a salad you have to limit the quantity and the number one that many people do is chopped potatoes or sliced ​​potatoes because you already know the potato, right ISS then you already knew number one and even so, many people do is add potatoes and eat it with the salad because there are a lot of carbohydrates that your body will digest, right, it will turn into sugar, it will increase your blood sugar, did you miss any salad, write in the comments and I I&amp;#39;ll answer you if this salad gets on the first or second list it also includes your region which salad is most common I&amp;#39;m talking about Porto Alegre and the most common salad here is the mayonnaise salad, joke guys, this is a joke, the most common salad here is tomato lettuce and onion which is one of my favorites write the state and city or country which part of the world you belong to also put a rating from 0 to 10 because if it is 10 I will make more videos like this now I will leave a suggestion for you watch, you already know about salads, you also need to know about fruits, you know which are the best and worst fruits for diabetics, in this video here I explain about it, I&amp;#39;m sure you&amp;#39;ll like it, hugs, see you next time.",

    "transcript": "hello everyone welcome to the taking control of your diabetes podcast and I&amp;#39;m one of the two co-host Dr Steve Edelman and unfortunately my good friend and colleague and co-host Dr Jeremy Pettis can&amp;#39;t be with us today we both have type 1 diabetes we work at UCSD uh and we also work for the not for-profit taking control of your diabetes want to remind everybody to please like uh And subscribe to the podcast and remember that we&amp;#39;re videotaping all our podcast uh so there&amp;#39;s going to be on YouTube as well as the podcast stations and look out for a lot of great videos we have set up for 2025 So today we&amp;#39;re going to talk about the teddy and Cascade studies uh these are two 20 yearlong studies looking at environmental and genetic factors that lead to the development of type 1 diabetes and I could say in at risk individuals we&amp;#39;ll learn a lot about it today we have Michael kilam he&amp;#39;s the director of The Clinical Services at Pacific Northwest Research Institute and he is one of two uh researchers that have been doing this very long running International uh these International Studies that have given us so many so much information on what are the risk factors leading to type one and I would say you might agree had brought up probably more question questions and answers because uh this is a tough area uh to tackle which is the cause of type 1 diabetes introduce yourself Michael and and my first part as you introduce yourself what led you to spend 20 years of your professional career uh in this area um okay great thank you so much um and thank you for having me here um I will say I got a chance to listen to some of your podcast and it&amp;#39;s always I always find it a little more fascinating when you have endocrinologist who has you know that that real personal experience with typ one um so let&amp;#39;s see myself um I have let&amp;#39;s say I&amp;#39;ve been with my husband for about 31 years now we have two grown kids um I&amp;#39;ve been living in Seattle for about 30 years um before that I worked as a uh paramedic um in Alabama and in down in Los Angeles um not a big fan of California um but you know what paramedic turns type one researcher I love it um well tell us a tell us a word about your co-host because I know you guys are a close group of guys that working very hard to advance the field of type 1 diabetes well so I&amp;#39;ll say you know the the thing that got me into this is like you know I decided to go back to school and look at other things and as a student started doing research and just found the the idea of it and kind of the way it worked in the puzzle of it very very interesting and so very exciting that you know I&amp;#39;ve gotten to spend this much time doing this um I I should correct you a little bit you said you know one of a couple on Teddy there&amp;#39;s there are so many of of us on this project I mean it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s a huge project with um with six clinical centers around the world um and it&amp;#39;s been an immense um project and um joy to kind of undertake as we try and understand you know what are those environmental factors that kind of triggered the disease um I I I&amp;#39;ll step back a little bit kind of you know before Teddy started we had you know some precursor studies that looked at you know trying to understand the disease process and with Teddy we were pretty clear okay genetics you&amp;#39;re you have to be predisposed to get type one but then there&amp;#39;s this black box something happens and that was really what we were charged with um and I have to say you know the niddk was very clear from day one all the way through today it&amp;#39;s like your first goal is to understand what are the environmental factors that trigger type 1 diabetes and you&amp;#39;re absolutely right it has led to probably more questions than answers but now we&amp;#39;re asking better questions it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s like the more we understand the the closer we can get to to Really um grasping this and understanding what how to prevent this disease yes and when I listen to your podcast that you did in the past I mean you said something very important this kind of research doesn&amp;#39;t occur overnight it takes time and your your advances within your study probably change direction as you learn more and more well let&amp;#39;s let&amp;#39;s tell our listeners and viewers now what is the teddy study and um it stands for the environmental determinance of diabetes study so it&amp;#39;s uh it&amp;#39;s such an important study because as you mentioned previously in your work and your Publications you know you get the genetic risk not everyone goes on to type 1 diabetes so what can explain those that go on and what those that do not so kind of what we under or what we believed our our hypothesis that we wanted to test here was that you know you start with genetic predisposition and then something in the environment comes along and triggers the immune system to start the attack um the vast majority of people I mean there&amp;#39;s about 5% of the people walking around who are genetically predisposed to get type one and the vast majority will never get type one at all and so there&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s something in you know in that smaller set that starts the process going um and there&amp;#39;s a lot of different things that we looked at and we were interested in um but you know viruses and diet and psychosocial factors all really kind of continue to kind of bubble up to the to the top there and so you know our goal was really just to look at you know to follow these kids um which is you know an observational study for they were from birth to 15 years um the whole stud is a little over 20 years but the kids are birth to 15 years so um it&amp;#39;s you know it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s a lot um trying to figure out and tease out kind of what&amp;#39;s important um unfortunately you know we aren&amp;#39;t allowed to keep them in a bubble and you know and then test one thing at a time like we would like um but you know this is where kind of the collaboration really comes into um into play is that by having such a large um set of participants we&amp;#39;re able to kind of tease out some of those more important factors um I I would just say that you know projects like Teddy um there are several Consortium projects that have been um funded um through projects like the special diabetes program um through the nvk and it&amp;#39;s like you know without that it&amp;#39;s like projects like this aren&amp;#39;t aren&amp;#39;t possible because it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s extremely expensive and time consuming to really do this and to get good quality data for this long yes I mean reading about this study maybe you can talk about some of the challenges and what you might have been looking for when you saw these patients and collected information on them every three months you know from blood to urine to stool nail clippings uh even hair but I heard that some of your participants didn&amp;#39;t like getting their hair cut before the usual time you&amp;#39;ve collected tremend mendous data and what kind of things were you looking for and that&amp;#39;s a tremendous uh I would say effort on the on the side of your volunteers that volunteered them or their kids to be in the study it&amp;#39;s I don&amp;#39;t know how you did it and and maintain such a high level of Recruitment and Retention in the study well I think there I mean I think there are a variety of a variety of reasons why it was successful um but you know as far as kind of what we&amp;#39;re looking at in in some ways it was like really broad Strokes um of you know what can we what can we possibly find obviously there were some things that we were interested in looking at some um you know previous studies had hinted at um things for example um cow&amp;#39;s milk being a risk factor and so that was one of the things that we wanted to look at as well um nice thing about Teddy is that because it&amp;#39;s large enough we have the power to not just look at things that may trigger disease but things that may be protective yes and cow milk was one of those that was really kind of nice because what we found was it wasn&amp;#39;t so much that cow milk was a was a risk factor but that you know breast mil was protective and so you know understanding of those those kind of individual things um how do we keep these people for so long I have to say that really goes down to the clinicians um you know I think that people join research because they you know one see some potential that this may help their child um as well as potential that this may help future Generations but honestly I don&amp;#39;t think that gets you to commit for 15 years yes and and I think the big difference there is the clinicians that we have the team of people and so many I&amp;#39;m constantly amazed at how many people are still on this project that were on this project when I first started and forming those relationships with the um with the families is really what what keeps the families in um one of the things we do at the end of the study as we ask them is like you know what are things you&amp;#39;d be willing to do again and what are things that you think worked well or didn&amp;#39;t work well and consistently people praise their clinician and it&amp;#39;s like it&amp;#39;s that it&amp;#39;s that connection that really keeps them coming back that that&amp;#39;s where it&amp;#39;s at it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s the relationship and you know you got to have faith in who you&amp;#39;re working with you got to have trust and and the the clinicians have to have empathy and understanding so I&amp;#39;ve done clinical research my whole career and that&amp;#39;s it right there for Recruitment and Retention uh for sure well let&amp;#39;s let&amp;#39;s go down some of the things maybe that you guys have discovered how about let&amp;#39;s just start off with viruses you know everyone has heard of the saaki B virus and I know that um certain viruses have been associated with folks coming down with type one and the other thing I&amp;#39;ll say is you know many of my patients they&amp;#39;re always trying to figure out why they got type one and they&amp;#39;ll say yeah I had this severe virus a few months before and I used to say to myself oh they&amp;#39;re full of it you know they&amp;#39;re just trying to associate something but they might they might have something there based on some of your research I I would say yes and no how&amp;#39;s that so one of the things that we&amp;#39;ve learned is really the autoimmunity um the process of you know the attack on the pancreas starts you know often years and years before the clinical onset of diabetes right and you know and I I hear those stories too from from our from our participants where it&amp;#39;s like oh you know I got really really sick and then you know a month later I was diagnosed like yeah that&amp;#39;s probably what put you over the edge but you know your body was already destroying those cells and that had been going on for a while um viruses have long been looked at um some research Studies have shown okay look virus is definitely and others have gone back to T it and not really been able to see any um any correlation in Teddy we were we were able because we were following these children so closely um the first four years of life every three months um we were really able to kind of look at the viruses that they were that they were exposed to um I should also say in addition to seeing them every three months in clinic they also mailed in monthly stool samples um so we had lots of biological material to work with and since viruses are shed in the stool we were able to kind of analyze that and I think one of the things that Teddy has found that is that is unique is that it&amp;#39;s really how long that infection processed so it&amp;#39;s not that you get a virus but it&amp;#39;s how long does that how long does that stay and so we saw that you know you have say you have you know a viral exposure and you know we see it in one stool sample then you know there may be a slightly increased risk but it&amp;#39;s significantly different when we see it at and 90 days there&amp;#39;s a there&amp;#39;s a definite increase in in the autoimmunity and so it&amp;#39;s how long does that Viral um that viral infection persist yeah and I I read that you know the hypothesis could be that they mutate if they&amp;#39;ve been around for a long time and that mutation somehow leads to the development of destruction of the beta cells well viruses are amazing at being able to adapt right and they you know they will they will live inside ourselves as long as they can um you know and just kind of hide there and unfortunately you know the the beta cells are one place that you know certain types of viruses are you know are attracted to yeah and I I love that quote um studying viruses like stalking ghosts was that the right phrase I I love that because then you can really you know have a picture view of what it&amp;#39;s like it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s not easy and anybody that&amp;#39;s knows anything about viruses how they mutate right before you try to exterminate them like like the covid virus for example all the different absolutely variants so um sometimes these viruses are harmless and some other some others lead to the development of type 1 diabetes what about the HLA region uh of the chromosome and you might want to if you can explain that in more lay terms you know because it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s a complicated area so the HLA region is basically just a section of your Crim Zone that encodes for um an for how your immune system responds and so you can um we we talk about um you know the antigen say the virus are portion of the virus being presented to the immune system and so the HLA region is one of the areas that decides kind of how your how your body responds to those um unfortunately certain H types also increase your risk for developing autoimmune diseases like type one or celiac disease and so with Teddy we started out with you know I I will say because it was such an ambitious project we really started with like the highest of the highest high risk um and so it wasn&amp;#39;t designed to really catch everyone um but to catch those who were more likely to progress during the time that we follow them and um what we found even that you know there there much more that we should be looking at besides just the age area um and so that kind of I I&amp;#39;ll give a quick plug for Cascade that kind of build built on Cascade there which is our next project which we started a few years ago and you know understanding okay these genes each of these genes weigh a little bit differently um as well as some of them provide protect protection against others and so understanding where those are and how how that interplay goes um to allow us to better you know in the future give a give a risk estimate um to you know to the parents of their children of like you know over their lifetime what are their chances of developing you know type one diabetes yes and um as I understand it the Cascade is looking for more interventions to uh prevent the development of type one I mean I&amp;#39;ve heard you say you know finding the cause is one thing but then then finding an intervention is another and is that what Cascade is about well um kind of um you know Cascade our our goal is really to um get get screening to be part of the standard of care um you know studies like Teddy have really shown us a lot but Teddy where it&amp;#39;s like you know we did this very expensive typing we also did a very expensive followup um it&amp;#39;s not it&amp;#39;s not practical um you know we just quite frankly we don&amp;#39;t have that many Healthcare dollars to to spend on it unfortunately and so Cascade we were able to take some of the things that we learned and it&amp;#39;s like okay what is really important here when it comes to predicting and understanding a child&amp;#39;s risk and so we better defined you know the gene the genes that we look at as well as kind of what the antibi schedule is when you have a very robust antibi schedule like Teddy head we&amp;#39;re able to then pull out certain visits and be like okay at what point do you start losing you know actual cases and so then narrow it down to um really just about three visits that they need to do over childhood um which is you know incredible to think you know we were doing more than that in their first year so well that&amp;#39;s what you discovered the the key the cre time the high-risk times to do studies and look for these markers now I I&amp;#39;ve I&amp;#39;ve heard you talk about modulators and so can you talk about like vitamin D vitamin C uh Omega fatty acids and what kind of what kind of results have you gotten in terms of their role in delaying the progr progression to type one in high-risk individuals so um I should start off um I&amp;#39;m not the nutritionist so maybe not the uh not not the perfect person but you know these things help um kind of you know vitamin D particularly will help um kind of lower your immune response and so when you have someone with a very um with autoimmunity you know potentially vitamin D can kind of decrease that response and what we found is that there&amp;#39;s you know just like anything there there are huge variations in that um one of the things that we discovered was um it had been it had been shown before there&amp;#39;s a vitamin D receptor Gene but one of the things that we found was that certain types of that Gene even if doesn&amp;#39;t matter how much vitamin D supplement you get your body can only absorb so much and and so you know the idea that we would just be able to give everyone Vitamin D supplements doesn&amp;#39;t it you know it&amp;#39;s not as effective um as well as potentially the amount that you&amp;#39;d have to give um could be could be a little toxic um so but you know understanding kind of how how these things play and as well as you know in the different individuals and the um the Gene and the Environmental action there understanding that a little bit better kind of helps us understand and develop um better interventions I think there is I can&amp;#39;t remember where it is right now um but I think there there are a couple of studies that are looking at Vitamin D interventions um to kind of slow down or stop the immune response and you know at the point where the kids are just um I say just but where they&amp;#39;re antibi positive but they have no clinical signs of type one which in my opinion is the optimum time that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s when we want to intervene when you still have plenty of beta cells to make enough insulin you know I tend to agree with you uh my my CGM just beep I&amp;#39;m not even sure where my phone is right now but that&amp;#39;s okay um in the chair next to you in the chair next to me thank you I don&amp;#39;t want it to beep again but you know having diabetes for 54 freaking years uh hurry up man I need something for people already have it um yeah you know I mean I was going to say that there are so many hypotheses out there uh and you know F finding one where you can get a positive result in people who early in stage and you&amp;#39;re talking about stage one type one diabetes and I happen to agree with you because the earlier you intervene uh the more viable beta cells you will have so I think I you know as you know now the tmab story it&amp;#39;s proved by the FDA teld that&amp;#39;s in stage two and they already have to have abnormal glucoses so I think you know our philosophy is the same and probably most people the earlier you can intervene the better but trying to identify those inter individuals now you you said that you took the very high-risk patients uh and then looked at some of these potential causitive factors what was your definition of a high-risk uh individual that would be put into Teddy the so the um so there is um I&amp;#39;m trying to think what what what absolute criteria was so the idea was the if you if you look at um risk over time the top 10% of the people who would develop type 1 diabetes so basically they had to have um to be in the study they had to have all you know both copies of genes that put them at risk um you know there are we kind of find the genes as you know susceptible resistant and neutral and susceptible and neutral is still at risk for diabetes but it&amp;#39;s not as high a risk and so all of these children had to have you know really both susceptible genes um and a subset of our population obviously also had you know family members with type 1 diabetes and so they had you know additional genes that were going on behind the scenes that we weren&amp;#39;t necessarily looking at initially for screening yeah we know we know having a first-degree relative puts their risk 15 times higher than others and uh so that&amp;#39;s important and then they get they really get into it if you have two relatives that have type one if you have your mother who has type one your father or identical twin so you took these high-risk individuals and look look for triggers that either prevented them or protected them from going on to type one well if you had to summarize uh off the you know I know this is off the top of your head some of the key the key findings of the teddy so far and how many individuals uh were in the teddy I believe it was 6,000 is that right um actually a little over 8,700 almost 8,800 wow yeah what what how could you summarize what some of your findings to this point in time well I think you know kind of going back to what we were saying before one of the things that we&amp;#39;ve really found is that there are this autoimmunity starts really really young um not just for type 1 diabetes but also for CAC disease and also for autoimmune thyroid disease which we we were studying those diseases as well because there is a link between them and type one and we want to understand that link um we were I I was amazed you know typically you look at thyroid disease and you don&amp;#39;t expect to see anything until you know right around puberty um whereas we were seeing things significantly much earlier than that um I think that&amp;#39;s exciting I think that provides you know potentially another opportunity of you know a way to intervene a longer time to intervene um I will you know other things that we looked at are there you know are kind of discovered is that there are different types of type one if you will um you know the outcome is the same but kind of the way you get there is very different um the younger you are the more aggressive the autoimmune process is and you know we&amp;#39;ve SE seen we we saw kids who would be you know they would go from antibi negative to antibi positive and then type one in a course of like three months whereas with you know with the teenagers you don&amp;#39;t see that it it takes years and then as you get you know older um you know adults adults developed type one as well you know just as many adults developed type one as children do which is why we&amp;#39;ve gotten away from calling it juvenile diabetes but you know the disease process in results tends to be a bit slower as well and there there are a variety of factors while that may be the case but these do tend to do tend to show up and the way that you would want to treat them and address them are different um there are other things that I thought were you know we talk about viruses um viruses to me are is pretty exciting um because we know how to deal with viruses we have a very low tox a low toxic way of dealing with viruses vaccines work um and if you have if you&amp;#39;re able to screen all of the children and understand you know know the children who are at risk then you know potentially you could change their recommended vaccine schedule and you know quickly reduce the incidents you know we may not get rid of type one all altoe but quickly reduce the incidents um without you know in without introducing a lot of you know typically it&amp;#39;s the imuno modulators that you have to that you would have to use whereas this is a much lower toxic and you know something they won&amp;#39;t have to like you know be on for the rest of their life if you will um another finding that we that we found that I I I think I say this every show I&amp;#39;m on so forgive me that&amp;#39;s okay um but um probiotics in the first month of life we were not expecting this um the nice thing about being in four different countries is that there are different recommendations for you know for introduction of you know of foods and you know medications and probiotics in the first month of life actually we saw a difference in autoimmunity these children had a lower incidence of um of autoimmunity than those that didn&amp;#39;t and I I love probiotics it&amp;#39;s like no toxicity um and it&amp;#39;s just generally good for you anyway are are the probiotics uh in the in the milk or how do you give a the kid that can&amp;#39;t chew obviously no teeth right right so so they have a liquid formula that they would put in in the um in the bottle and so you can mix it either with breast milk or with with the regular cow milk formula wow well the the other issue that you touched on is celiac uh and autoimmune thyroid disease and that&amp;#39;s Graves and Hashimoto um yes as I understand it uh those folks have a much higher risk of developing type 1 diabetes you know after developing one of those autoimmune conditions and would you put them on the the same level of risk as a first-degree relative with type one and those individuals I&amp;#39;m my my impression is they should be the highest level of screening along with family members I you know I don&amp;#39;t know that we necessarily put them on the same um the same risk level um celect disease you know it does it does increase your risk um the problem is that with um to take cxes for example it&amp;#39;s like you could be at risk for celiac but then have um one copy of the gene that&amp;#39;s protective against type one it&amp;#39;s not going to protect you against celiac disease but it would be more protective against type one and so their risk may not be as High um but I do agree with you completely that you know these people have some of some of the genes that would that would increase their risk and so it is absolutely worth screening them and worth looking at um you know we we know and we&amp;#39;ve seen over and over not just in Teddy but in other studies that you know the earlier you catch it the the better the outcomes and those outcomes you know those improved outcomes last for years after diagnosis and so it&amp;#39;s not just avoiding hospital stays and and time in the ICU it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s better glucose control for years to come yeah and U I&amp;#39;m glad you mentioned that because one of the benefits of screening in a study like Teddy or any study for type one uh in the early stages is that everyone gets educated on the signs and symptoms of when diabetes starts to kick in and you could avoid a like you said uh Intensive Care Unit visit uh a really dramatic presentation where the whole family&amp;#39;s disrupted so I think either knowing that you have risk is important and that has long-term benefits because you can have better control from the very beginning well Michael um in 20125 where do we stand with um screening for type one and if if the your centers are still looking for individuals for future studies it&amp;#39;s probably good to let us know how to get in more information so I will say in 2025 it is very exciting for screening um and and part of that really is with the first approval of an FDA drug um prior to diagnosis um I think that&amp;#39;s going to be one of many that that are in the that come out um but you know it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s very there are programs um all over the world that are coming up uh we actually collaborate with quite a few of them providing you know genetic um genetic and antibody work for them um so you know it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s an exciting time um but at the same time there&amp;#39;s still so much to do because so many providers don&amp;#39;t know who who should be tested and don&amp;#39;t you know don&amp;#39;t necessarily have the information and so that&amp;#39;s still very much a part that you know we and others are working on is because it&amp;#39;s like I you don&amp;#39;t necessarily expect the general population to know but you know certainly when they&amp;#39;re seeing their provider they should be able to make those recommendations and those are changing um we Cascade right now is just screening um newborns up to nine months born in Washington state and the reason why we&amp;#39;re choosing the reason why we&amp;#39;re using that group is that we want this project will end with an application to the Board of Health to add type one screening to the um New panel and so we&amp;#39;re working with the newborn screening program so that we are using the exact same samples that they collect um we&amp;#39;re not collecting anything more um but to you know demonstrate that you know those samples work and it&amp;#39;s sufficient and you know it can be it can be done without you know by by their current their current system and that just to reiterate that&amp;#39;s all babies not babies with a family history or any risk factors so I think I think that&amp;#39;d be coste effective as well I I think you know we want to we want to change someone&amp;#39;s life for the better but if it&amp;#39;s cost effective it&amp;#39;s a winwin well and unfortunately I mean it really does have to be cost effective because I mentioned earlier it&amp;#39;s like we only have so many Healthcare dollars and you know and trying to look at you know how that gets spent effectively and we have an economist that&amp;#39;s working with us that it will help us with this final application to look at you know okay if we look at um screening everyone and then the children that need to have antibi followup you know what does that look like compared to we don&amp;#39;t do anything and then the children are in the hospital and ICU stay and it&amp;#39;s been for a long time it&amp;#39;s been like okay the the math doesn&amp;#39;t add up it cost way more to screen um but I think that we are if not there we are really really close yeah well thank you for that well in closing I want to make sure all of our viewers and listeners know that um any first-degree relative of someone with type one uh and or with auto other autoimmune conditions really should be screened and it&amp;#39;s very easy to get screened these days information for screening is on our website at tc.org and uh if you want more information about Michael and all the studies are doing specifically this the teddy and Cascade I would say pnri i.org would that be the best website absolutely and you know we have we have in the past kind of done um we don&amp;#39;t necessarily have a general population um project right now but it is something that we&amp;#39;re hoping to get kind of up and going again um and so you know our website would be a great place to kind of get that information as those things evolve well thank you so much Michael it&amp;#39;s been it&amp;#39;s been an ultimate pleasure of mine to get to talk to you about this such an important study that&amp;#39;s been going on for so long on a very complicated condition such as the cause of type one diabetes thank you so much for your time",

    "transcript": "Having very high sugar and a lot of insulin in the blood can cause nail fungus, skin candidiasis, warts, spots or darker skin on our neck, armpit, and even make our skin drier and very itchy. But how do you know that this is due to diabetes? And if it is, how do you know if you are in an early stage or if you already have a more advanced disease? Hello everyone, I am Dr. Veller, a doctor with three specialties Family Health , Internal Medicine and Nephrology and with my knowledge and experience I want to help you detect this disease early so that you can combat it. In a few minutes I am going to reveal to you the seven most important symptoms that do appear on your skin that may indicate that you have diabetes, prediabetes or very high insulin. But I also want to warn you. Many of the spots or wounds that I am going to show you indicate diabetes in its earliest stages . But there are three injuries that are more dangerous and I want you to look at them very carefully, since in those cases the problem is not really in the skin. They hide much more serious complications in your internal organs such as the kidney, heart or your circulation and in your eyes. And today I am going to reveal them to you. Without further ado, number one, excess sugar in your blood causes fungus to appear on your nails or in the region of folds in your skin such as the groin or between the rolls of the belly. And here we are talking about two types of fungi: onychomycosis and candida fungus infection. Onychomycosis is very common. They can appear on your toenails or fingernails. Many of my patients discovered that they were diabetic because these fungi were never cured. And what happens is that in order to completely eliminate them, you have to control your blood sugar. Now, if you have redness or very itchy spots between your belly rolls, in your groin, in your armpit, or elsewhere on your skin, you may have yeast infection. Also a common complication in patients with diabetes. Many times they even appear in the genital region. The good news is that this has treatment. It doesn&amp;#39;t matter how old you are or what stage of diabetes you are in. In many cases, this shows diabetes in early stages when we are still able to reverse it. Number two And many do not know this, having very high blood sugar and especially a lot of insulin, causes warts to appear on your neck and armpit. These warts may have a peculiarity: they may be darker, as if they were small moles that rise above your skin. These are known as Acrochordons. They are harmless, small benign tumors that do not cause symptoms. Having one or two in some part of your body may be normal, but if you have many grouped together, especially in those regions of the body, it may be because your insulin is very high or even because you already have diabetes, especially type two diabetes. And what happens is that before your sugar gets too high, your pancreas works hard to keep it at normal levels and to do this it has to secrete more and more insulin. The problem is that this is a double-edged sword. Insulin, although it lowers your blood sugar, also acts as if it were a growth hormone. It makes these warts grow, in addition to obviously making you accumulate visceral fat, stimulating obesity and slowing down your metabolism. Now not everything has to be bad news. If you noticed that you are getting these small tumors, you may have prediabetes or diabetes in very early stages and if you detect it in time you will be able to completely reverse it. On the other hand, if you have already suffered from diabetes for a long time, you may need to control it better by adjusting your remedies. And here I want to clarify a question that you always ask me: Is there a cure for diabetes? Can it be reversed? And what does early stage diabetes mean? Well, the answer is yes. We can reverse diabetes, but of course, it all depends on what stage it is. In the first years the main problem is having very high sugar in your blood, but there are still no chronic or irreversible complications, such as damage to your eyes, damage to your kidney or your circulation. If we grab it here, it&amp;#39;s much easier to reverse. This is what we know such as early stage diabetes. Now, when the sugar circulating in your blood is very high and for many years, complications begin to appear. For example, loss of sight due to damage to your retina, kidney problems. This organ begins to filter your blood less and also problems with your circulation and your heart. But I tell you something, in some cases, even in these stages, it is possible to reverse it or at least control it completely and above all, prevent the damage from continuing to advance and be very attentive, because three of the symptoms that I am going to show you in Your skin may indicate that you already have some of these complications in a hidden way without you knowing it. Continuing with symptom number three that deceives us all. Very dry and very itchy skin. Very high blood sugar can cause this, especially on the forearm, thigh, buttocks, but it can occur anywhere on your body, including your hands, between your fingers, and on the bottoms of your feet. feet. But how do we know if this is caused by diabetes or because our skin is just like that? Well, it&amp;#39;s one thing to have dry skin for a long time, even since when we were children or teenagers, or we were always allergic. Another thing is that once we are an adult, these injuries have appeared and, above all, they are getting worse. Even though we are using moisturizers and different remedies that the doctor gave us. That is, the lesions or itching do not decrease in these cases. In addition to hydrating your skin and avoiding very hot showers that make the itching worse, you should measure your blood sugar. Over time you will notice that the skin becomes rougher, harder and begins to peel. This may be because you are scratching a lot, but don&amp;#39;t worry because having very dry skin does not necessarily indicate that you have more advanced diabetes or that you already have complications. It may even indicate that you are still in the early stages. Number four Another symptom that can also indicate that you have a lot of insulin in your blood and is very common, especially in people with prediabetes, are these brown spots on your neck, in your armpit. It&amp;#39;s called Acanthosis Nigricans. Just like with the warts I had mentioned. Detecting diabetes in these stages can be good news, since you have time to completely reverse it. On the other hand, if you are already a person who has suffered from this disease for a long time and have these spots, there is also a lot that can be done to improve your quality of life and here I draw your attention. Diabetes should no longer be seen as a death sentence, but really only those who suffer from it know how difficult it is to deal with this problem and all the others that are associated with obesity, food cravings, especially sweets. , the mental health problems that this implies. But today there are excellent and natural ways to control this disease and use your habits and foods as true natural remedies. As we tell you in detail in our work The superpower of food. Below I am going to tell you three symptoms on your skin that may indicate that you already have complications in your eyes, your kidneys or your circulation and heart. And finally, I am going to reveal some spots and lesions on your skin that, in addition to diabetes, can indicate that you have very high triglycerides and cholesterol. So, if you detect any of these lesions on your skin, in addition to measuring your sugar, you should do a more in-depth checkup, including a urine and retina exam. The first of them is number five on the list of diabetic dermopathies. Many doctors and patients confuse these spots as if they were only due to age. But this is a serious mistake. This is a 65-year-old man who consulted several dermatologists about these spots, used various creams and remedies, but later discovered that it was actually diabetes. Diabetic dermopathies are these dark brown spots that over time become atrophic, that is, as if they were a scar that sinks slightly into your skin. The problem is that it doesn&amp;#39;t give symptoms. They can be there for a long time without disturbing, but they can also hide much more serious problems. And here I ask for special attention. These injuries are directly linked to three serious complications of diabetes, such as retinopathy or damage to your eyes, neuropathy or damage to your nerves, and nephropathy, kidney failure. Now, if you have these spots, it does not mean that you do have diabetes or that you already have these complications. It simply indicates that you are at greater risk. And in fact, in some cases the diabetes is not so advanced, you can also reverse it. But open your eyes if, in addition to these spots, your diabetes has been uncontrolled for a long time or you want to change your lenses because you think you see worse, or if when you are urinating you see that a lot of foam is forming in the toilet, it is time to consult with your doctor. Another symptom that may also indicate that you already have diabetes complications is number six on this list. Red, very thin skin on your legs and feet. Many confuse this with varicose veins, but they are not. It is known as atrophic skin and occurs due to a reduction in the thickness and elasticity of your skin. It looks thin, fragile, as if it were transparent because you can see the blood vessels underneath. This may indicate that you have poor blood flow or circulation problems in this region and also damage to your nerves from having high blood sugar for too long. The third symptom that may indicate diabetes complications is number seven on the Wounds that won&amp;#39;t heal list. Be careful because this may indicate that you have long-standing diabetes, sugar circulating in your blood for a long time and this ended up causing damage to your circulation and also to your nerves, like the two injuries that I showed you previously and that is why it is very difficult for your body. heal the wounds. I ask you to look especially at your feet between your toes. You may have some small ulcers that, if infected, can cause serious problems and a lot of attention here. Weeks, months before a wound forms or opens, you may notice that that part of your skin is thicker, that a callus is formed. At that moment you must do everything to prevent it from getting complicated. How do you do it? Obviously, quickly consulting with your doctor and as icing on the cake, symptom number eight on the list that indicates not only that you may have diabetes, but also very high cholesterol and triglycerides, are these yellowish scaly plaques or spots around your eyes, on all in the eyelids. It&amp;#39;s called xanthelasmas. These lesions are not closely related to the severity of diabetes, since they can appear even in very early stages in those who have prediabetes. They are not serious and may disappear when your metabolism problems are controlled. Today science has advanced a lot. There are excellent natural ways to control all these problems and if necessary, there are very effective remedies. Before you need to take insulin and before things get complicated. But the key is to detect problems in time. At Dr. Veller, we have a mission. We know that many times in real life, consultations with a doctor last five minutes. Things are not explained very well. And how difficult it is to consult with a specialist. My brother is a cardiologist, I am an internist and nephrologist. So take advantage of these videos, the enormous effort we put into making each one of them, all always backed by an enormous scientific source and years of experience. The only thing we ask of you in return is that you share this material, subscribe to our channel and help us continue growing. I send you a big greeting from my corner of the world. Bye Bye.",

of these fruits has a surprising effect that helps your body process sugar more efficiently and prevents dangerous spikes doctors are impressed with how fast the results are I&amp;#39;ll be completely honest if I were to die tomorrow I would want every diabetic to know this important information today if you&amp;#39;d like to take notes now is a great time to grab a pen and paper before we get started I&amp;#39;d love to know where you&amp;#39;re joining us from today leave a comment below and feel free to ask any questions you have and don&amp;#39;t forget to click the Subscribe button and turn on notifications so you don&amp;#39;t miss these crucial diabetes improving tips here on facing diabetes first let&amp;#39;s talk about peaches many people think that sweet fruits are automatically bad for blood sugar but what if I told you that peaches can actually help regulate it that&amp;#39;s right this juicy fruit isn&amp;#39;t just delicious it&amp;#39;s packed with fiber and polyphenols that slow down sugar absor stion preventing dangerous spikes a study published in the Journal of medicinal food found that certain compounds in peaches May improve insulin sensitivity helping your body process glucose more effectively so instead of avoiding peaches maybe it&amp;#39;s time to look at them differently think about it have you ever been told to cut out all sweet fruits to control your diabetes it&amp;#39;s a common misconception that leaves many people missing out on powerful natural allies the fiber in peaches acts like a natural sugar regulator ensuring that glucose enters your bloodstream more gradually plus the antioxidants in peaches help fight inflammation which is a hidden Factor behind insulin resistance so should you really be afraid of this fruit or could it actually be a secret weapon in your diet what&amp;#39;s even more fascinating is that peaches contain flavonoids that may reduce the risk of complications linked to diabetes like nerve damage and heart disease researchers have found that these natural compounds can support blood vessel health and even reduce oxidative stress in the body that means peaches aren&amp;#39;t just helping your blood sugar they&amp;#39;re protecting your overall health makes you wonder how many other fruits have we been unfairly avoiding now I&amp;#39;d love to hear from you what&amp;#39;s your experience with peaches have you been avoiding them or have you already added them to your diet drop a comment below with the word Peach power if you&amp;#39;re willing to give them a chance and remember this is a community where we help each other so feel free to ask anything we&amp;#39;re here to support you and speaking of Sweet Surprises there&amp;#39;s another incredible reason why peaches deserve a spot on your plate it&amp;#39;s something most people Overlook but it can make a big difference in how your body handles sugar peaches are not just a tasty treat they have a unique way of supporting blood sugar control that many people Overlook unlike processed sweets that flood your bloodstream with sugar peaches contain a balanced mix of fiber vitamins and bioactive compounds that help stabilize glucose levels one of the key elements is pectin a type of soluble fiber found in peaches that slows down digestion and prevents sudden sugar spikes instead of sending your blood sugar on a roller coaster ride peaches work with your body to release glucose more gradually but here&amp;#39;s the real surprise scientists have discovered that peaches contain compounds called phenolic acids which may actively reduce insulin resistance a study published in food and function found that these natural plant compounds can improve how cells respond to insulin making it easier for the body to manage sugar effectively this means that instead of harming your blood sugar levels peaches might actually help your body handle sugar better have you ever thought of a sweet fruit as something that could improve your diabetes management instead of making it worse there&amp;#39;s another hidden benefit most people don&amp;#39;t know about peaches are rich in vitamin C an essential nutrient that plays a crucial role in reducing oxidative stress and inflammation two major factors that contribute to insulin resistance in fact research suggests that people with diabetes often have lower levels of vitamin C which can make blood sugar fluctuations even worse by including peaches in your diet you&amp;#39;re not just satisfying your sweet tooth you&amp;#39;re giving your body a powerful tool to fight off the harmful effects of high blood sugar and let&amp;#39;s not forget about hydration peaches have a high water content which helps keep you hydrated and supports kidney function many people with diabetes struggle with dehydration due to frequent urination which can make blood sugar even harder to control eating water water-rich fruits like peaches can help maintain better hydration levels without the added sugars found in many store-bought juices so next time you&amp;#39;re craving something refreshing why not reach for a peach instead now let me ask you have you ever noticed how different foods affect your blood sugar some people are more sensitive to certain fruits than others so I encourage you to pay attention to how your body reacts if you&amp;#39;re curious to experiment try adding a small portion of peaches to your meals and see how your blood sugar responds keep a food journal for a few days and write down your observations you might be surprised by the results I&amp;#39;d love to hear your thoughts on this if you&amp;#39;re excited to test out peaches drop a comment below with peach test and let&amp;#39;s see how this fruit works for you and remember this is a space where we support each other so if you have any questions about diabetes nutrition or anything else don&amp;#39;t hesitate to ask someone in our community might have the answer you need now that we know peaches can actually help stabilize blood sugar the next big question is what&amp;#39;s the best way to eat them because here&amp;#39;s the catch not all peaches are created equal fresh whole peaches are packed with fiber and nutrients but once they&amp;#39;re processed turned into juices canned with syrup or dried with added sugars their blood sugar benefits disappear many store-bought Peach products have more added sugar than a can of soda so if you&amp;#39;ve been eating peaches in the wrong form that might explain why you haven&amp;#39;t seen the benefits yet the key is to eat peaches in their natural state preferably with the skin on the skin is is where a lot of the fiber and antioxidants are concentrated helping to slow down sugar absorption if you prefer them sliced try pairing them with a source of protein or healthy fats like Greek yogurt or a handful of nuts why because combining peaches with protein or fat slows digestion even further making sure your blood sugar stays stable for longer think about it have you ever eaten fruit alone and felt hungry an hour later that&amp;#39;s because fruit digests quickly pairing it with something else helps keep you full and energized for longer another tip timing matters eating peaches right after a balanced meal with protein fiber and healthy fats can minimize any potential blood sugar spikes if you eat them on an empty stomach the sugar will hit your bloodstream faster potentially causing a slight rise but when you combine peaches with a well-rounded meal your body processes the sugar much more efficiently simple adjustments like this can make a huge difference in how you feel throughout the day and here&amp;#39;s a fun challenge for you if you&amp;#39;ve ever had peaches with something like ice cream or sweetened yogurt I challenge you to try a healthier combination instead swap it for plain Greek yogurt with cinnamon or pair it with some almond butter then come back and let me know in the comments how you liked it drop Peach swap if you&amp;#39;re up for the challenge trust me once you find the right way to enjoy peaches you&amp;#39;ll never go

    "transcript": "Leg cramps at night, restless legs or tingling. Nightmares and vivid dreams. Diabetes can manifest itself in the most varied ways. There are very common symptoms that appear at night that indicate that you may have early-stage diabetes and not know it. Despite what I am going to tell you, today we know that diabetes is treatable and in many cases it is possible to reverse it. Or if you are using several medications, including insulin, it is possible to reduce their dose and amount. That is why today I am going to reveal to you the seven warning signs of diabetes that appear at night and that if you identify them, it is better that you get a check-up to detect it as soon as possible and treat it. And stay until the end because I am also going to show you three very powerful natural remedies that you surely have in your kitchen to help you control blood glucose levels and combat this disease naturally. A lot of attention. This is the first symptom that usually appears in people with diabetes at night. It&amp;#39;s called nocturia, that is, urinating a lot at night. It is very important and I am going to tell you a personal experience. A 58-year-old relative asked me one day why he might be urinating so many times at night. He told me that he was getting up four or five times and couldn&amp;#39;t sleep. The first thing I asked him is if he was drinking a lot of water before going to bed or coffee mate or some tea with a diuretic effect after seven or eight at night or if he had a prostate problem. The answer was no, there was no apparent cause. Then I asked him to measure his glucose on an empty stomach in the morning and it gave him 250, meaning he had diabetes. He began treatment taking metformin and at the same time making changes in habits, improvements in diet, consuming more anti-inflammatory foods, doing physical exercise, even lifting weights. In less than a year he was able to stop metformin and today his glucose is always below 120. And here I want to make two messages clear to you. First, getting up to urinate at night can be normal as long as it happens only once or twice if you are more than 70 years older than this or if it repeatedly interrupts your sleep, you should think that something is wrong. In most cases, this symptom is caused by bad habits that we have or by some benign condition. But if you&amp;#39;ve never had a checkup, it&amp;#39;s better to check your blood glucose because it can indicate diabetes. Second, we don&amp;#39;t stop exercising because we get old. On the contrary, we become old because we stop exercising. Many will say that this is very difficult and that it is not possible, especially after 50 years of age. But the science today is very clear. Doing muscle hypertrophy and strength exercises even after this age can rejuvenate us by ten years or more. And no matter how old you are, this can cause you to even reduce the amount of remedies you are taking. Second sign you should pay attention to: Blurred vision at night. Sudden changes in blood glucose can affect your vision and in many cases it manifests itself in this way mainly when it is getting dark and it is darker. I have patients who tell me that they have stopped driving in the afternoon or at night precisely because of this problem. Or some people, for example, who get up at night, either to go to the bathroom or to drink water, and experience very blurred vision, much more intense than during the day. In this case, in addition to consulting with your eye doctor, get a check-up. It can be a symptom of diabetes in the early stages and this has treatment. In fact, if the blurred vision is really caused because you have very high blood glucose when you start treatment and modify your habits, your diet, in less than a week, this symptom improves. Number three, excessive thirst. When glucose is very high in the blood, especially above 200, it has a diuretic effect. It makes you urinate more. During the day you may not feel thirsty because you have access to water, you urinate a lot and recover that fluid by drinking water, but at night, as you continue to produce urine, you become dehydrated and wake up with that feeling of dry mouth. Very thirsty at night. It is very common for these people to go to sleep already with the water bottle next to the bed and many times when you don&amp;#39;t wake up because of thirst, you notice it. When you wake up, your mouth is very dry or you develop canker sores, very painful mouth sores, even bad breath and dental problems such as cavities. This problem of being very thirsty is called polydipsia. One of the first symptoms that people with diabetes notice. Number four and this can be very annoying. Leg cramps with very intense pain, either in the calf or the soles of the feet that wakes the person in the middle of the night. This can occur due to various diabetes-related problems. First, dehydration caused by high blood glucose levels. Second, circulation problems, which causes a decrease in the delivery of oxygen and nutrients to the muscles of your legs. Third, fluctuation in blood glucose levels, which can cause alterations in potassium, sodium, calcium and magnesium in your blood, which ends up causing cramps or can be caused by neuropathy. That is, diabetes has already advanced a little further. and it&amp;#39;s damaging your peripheral nerves. At this point I want to remind you that you are not alone. Diabetes affects thousands of people and today there are very effective treatments. But not only that, we are seeing more and more patients reverting to diabetes, especially when it is caught in the early stages and those who already have more advanced diabetes. There is also a lot to do to improve the quality of life. I&amp;#39;m going to tell you some tips on natural remedies that can help you a lot. And here this has to be very clear. To treat diabetes you do not have to diet, this is not what it is about. A diet has a start and end date. What you have to do is forever change the way you look at food. The way we eat a meal should not only provide us with calories, it must provide us with nutrients, active ingredients and they must act in our body as true natural remedies. Eating well is not expensive, despite what many believe, it becomes expensive when they complicate things. We have to be able to take advantage of the nutrients and medicinal properties of common foods. As I&amp;#39;m going to tell you, symptom number five: nightmares and night terrors. A patient&amp;#39;s wife told me the other day that she couldn&amp;#39;t sleep because her husband would get up at night or scream because of the nightmares he was having. What is happening? Changes in the brain chemistry of these patients, including very high glucose, can alter the release of neurotransmitters such as serotonin, which are chemical messengers we have in the brain. This, added to the stress and anxiety of these people, plus the sleep disruption they may experience from getting up at night to urinate or drink water, and the changes in perception they may suffer due to very high blood glucose levels, can lead to have disturbing dreams. Now, not all people with diabetes experience this. It can be caused by other medical conditions, but if it becomes a new-onset symptom in your life, get checked, including testing your blood glucose levels. Number six Restless legs syndrome and nocturnal tingling is very common during the day. You may not feel anything, but you go to bed at night to rest and it&amp;#39;s like you can&amp;#39;t find a comfortable position for your legs or you have that intense need to constantly move them . This can be caused by various reasons in diabetes, alterations in blood circulation, very high blood glucose levels that alter the function of your nerves or imbalance in the levels of iron and other minerals in your blood that can cause this sensation in your limbs. In other cases it does not manifest as restless legs, but as numbness or tingling, annoying, often painful in your feet. This can be caused by diabetes in the early stages, but at the same time it can also be caused by diabetes that is already a little more advanced, where there are complications such as neuropathy. So it is very important that you get a check-up. Number Seven Sleep Apnea This is a dangerous condition in which the patient stops breathing for a few seconds during the night. At that moment, as there is a respiratory pause, the oxygen levels in your blood fall to dangerously low levels and suddenly the person begins. It&amp;#39;s like breathing is activated again and you start breathing sharply. This person is generally not aware of the problem because he or she does not wake up. The one who notices it is the person who sleeps with him. But even if the patient does not wake up, his sleep is not restful and the next day he is very tired, fatigued or falling asleep during the day. This may indicate that you have sleep apnea. While this condition is not directly caused by diabetes, an association is known to exist. Up to 50% of people with diabetes may have apnea. Therefore, since this association exists, it is important that if you have any of these problems, look for the other one. Now I am going to tell you three foods that work as natural remedies against diabetes and can control your blood glucose levels, on an empty stomach and also at night. Consume any or all of these for three or four weeks. And then tell me how it went. Get checked again so you can see the results first. Organic apple cider vinegar with mother. There are many studies that show that adding 10 to 15 milliliters or a tablespoon to your carbohydrate-rich foods such as beans, lentils, rice or even any meal, decreases high blood glucose spikes after eating. Vinegar is a true natural remedy. It makes you lose weight, improves your metabolism, makes you eat less because it generates a satiety or full stomach effect and is also a powerful natural medicine against diabetes. Another way to use it is to dilute 10 to 15 milliliters or a tablespoon in a glass of water. It can be cold or warm as you like and you take this on an empty stomach and before lunch and dinner. Be careful, do not drink pure vinegar because it can damage the mucosa and mouth, the enamel of your teeth and cause burns to the esophagus. If you don&amp;#39;t get the organic vinegar with the mother. Use the vinegar you have available, since the active ingredient is the acetic acid present. Also in other types of vinegar. Second natural remedy, pomegranate, a fruit with ancient medicinal properties, but today we see all its benefits. The ideal dose that was made in scientific studies is a glass of 200 or 250 milliliters of pomegranate juice every day for 3 to 4 weeks. But we know that this fruit is difficult to get in some places. So you can consume it at least two to three times a week. You will also have enormous benefits. To prepare its juice, you can use the seeds of a whole fruit, put it in a blender with 200 to 250 milliliters of water and then drink its unfiltered juice. Or you can eat its seeds directly with a spoon directly from the fruit and even prepare an infusion from its peel. In our book The Superpower of Food, we tell you all this in much more detail. Third natural remedy beet or beet juice. You can take it every day and it has spectacular effects, especially when combined with physical exercise, running, swimming, cycling and even doing strength and resistance exercises, since it improves your circulation, it can reduce all these annoying symptoms that I told you about before. , such as cramps, tingling and numbness, and even improves the delivery of oxygen to your muscles. Taking it every day reduces inflammation, improves insulin resistance and controls blood glucose levels. And if that were not enough, it also serves to control high blood pressure. You can prepare with a whole beet with peel and everything in 200 to 250 milliliters of water. You blend it and drink it without filtering. You can add a little turmeric or ginger or mint, whatever you like best. Another option is to eat the vegetable raw, also with the peel and everything in your salads and if it is a little heavy or you don&amp;#39;t like it raw, you can boil it for 5 to 10 minutes. No more than this so as not to lose its medicinal properties. You can also leave it steaming for a bit. In addition to all this, to control diabetes, don&amp;#39;t forget to drink enough water. Do this for four weeks and then come back and comment below how it went. You&amp;#39;ll be surprised. I hope you really liked the video. Subscribe to our channel.

setting the tone for stable blood sugar throughout the day many people unknowingly start their Mornings in ways that cause blood sugar spikes leading to fatigue cravings and insulin resistance but by making a few simple changes you can take control of your health and feel energized focused and balanced here are six powerful morning habits that can help lower blood sugar naturally and set you up for Success one start your day with hydration one of the simplest yet most powerful habits for managing diabetes is hydrating as soon as you wake up while many people reach for coffee or tea first thing in the morning drinking water before anything else can have a profound impact on blood sugar control and overall health overnight your body naturally loses water through breathing and metabolic processes if you wake up even slightly dehydrated your blood becomes more concentrated which can lead to higher blood sugar levels proper hydration helps flush out excess glucose through the kidneys making it easier for your body to maintain balance throughout the day water also plays a crucial role in digestion metabolism and circulation when you start your morning with a glass of water you are giving your body the support it needs to function efficiently hydration is particularly important for people with diabetes because dehydration can lead to insulin resistance making it harder for your cells to absorb glucose properly for those who find plain water unappealing adding a slice of lemon cucumber or fresh mint can provide subtle flavor without affecting blood sugar herbal teas without added sweeteners can also be a good alternative drinking enough water in the morning can also help curb cravings and prevent unnecessary snacking later in the day when the body is dehydrated it often sends hunger signals which can lead to consuming unnecessary calories and carbohydrates by making hydration a non-negotiable part of your morning routine you set a strong foundation for stable blood sugar levels improved energy and better overall well-being a simple habit like drinking water may seem small but over time it becomes a powerful tool in managing diabetes naturally two eat a protein and fiber rich breakfast the first meal of the day has a profound impact on blood sugar control energy levels and overall metabolic health for people with diabetes choosing a breakfast rich in protein and fiber is one of the most effective ways to prevent glucose spikes and sustain energy throughout the day in the morning the body is naturally more resistant to insulin due to hormonal fluctuations that occur overnight this means that consuming a high carbohydrate breakfast such as cereal pastries or white bread can quickly lead to a sharp rise in blood sugar followed by an inevitable crash this cycle not only affects energy levels but also increases Cravings making it harder to maintain stable glucose levels protein plays a critical role in slowing digestion and preventing rapid glucose absorption it provides the body with a essential amino acids supports muscle function and helps regulate hunger hormones fiber on the other hand adds bulk to meals and slows the release of glucose into the bloodstream preventing sudden blood sugar fluctuations together they create a balanced meal that promotes satiety reduces cravings and improves long-term blood sugar control ideal breakfast options include eggs with leafy greens and avocado Greek yogurt with nuts and seeds or a bowl of oatmeal with flax seeds and berries these meals provide a combination of protein fiber and healthy fats that nourish the body without overloading it with excess carbohydrates by making protein and fiber a priority in the morning you establish a steady foundation for blood sugar stability a well-balanced breakfast does more than satisfy hunger it fuels the body in a way that supports long-term Health enhances focus and makes diabetes management more effective throughout the day three limit caffeine or pair it with protein for many people the morning doesn&amp;#39;t feel complete without a cup of coffee it provides Comfort warmth and the energy needed to start the day however for those managing diabetes caffeine can have a more complex effect on blood sugar than most realize while it does not contain carbohydrates or sugar caffeine stimulates the release of stress hormones such as cortisol and adrenaline which in turn signal the liver to release stored glucose into the bloodstream this response can cause an unexpected rise in blood sugar particularly for those with insulin resistance the way caffeine affects blood sugar varies from person to person some people may experience little to no impact While others might notice a significant increase in glucose levels after consuming coffee if blood sugar spikes occur consistently after drinking coffee it may be worth adjusting consumption habits one of the best ways to reduce caffeine&amp;#39;s impact is to pair it with protein drinking coffee on an empty stomach can amplify its effects on blood sugar whereas having it with a protein rich breakfast can help slow glucose absorption and stabilize energy levels adding a scoop of protein powder collagen or unsweetened plant-based milk can also create a more balanced beverage for those who find that caffeine disrupts their blood sugar control switching to decaffeinated coffee or herbal teas may be a better option paying close attention to how the body responds to caffeine is essential for making informed decisions about morning routines by being mindful of caffeine intake and pairing it strategically with nourishing foods it is possible to enjoy the ritual of morning coffee while maintaining steady blood sugar levels and supporting overall health four move your body for 10 15 minutes physical movement in the morning is one of the most effective ways to naturally regulate blood sugar while many people think of exercise as something that requires a gym membership or an intense workout even a few minutes of movement in the morning can make a significant difference for those managing diabetes when the body moves the muscles actively use glucose for energy this process helps lower blood sugar levels without relying solely on insulin regular physical activity also improves insulin sensitivity meaning the body becomes more efficient at transporting glucose into the cells reducing the risk of blood sugar spikes throughout the day a short walk after breakfast gentle stretching or a simple body weight routine can activate the muscles and set up positive tone for the rest of the day walking in particular has been shown to help lower postmeal blood sugar levels even 10 minutes of movement can make a measurable impact preventing gluc from accumulating in the bloodstream and reducing the risk of energy crashes later in the day beyond blood sugar control movement supports circulation reduces stress hormones and enhances mental Clarity morning activity also boosts Mood by promoting the release of endorphins making it easier to stay motivated and focused incorporating movement into a morning routine does not need to be complicated the key is consistency a small habit like a short walk or a few minutes of yoga can become a powerful tool in long-term diabetes management by making movement a priority in the morning the body is better prepared to maintain stable blood sugar and sustain energy throughout the day five manage stress before it manages you morning stress can silently disrupt blood blood sug control yet many people Overlook its impact stress triggers the release of cortisol and adrenaline hormones that prepare the body for a fight ORF flight response while this reaction is natural it also signals the liver to release stored glucose into the bloodstream for people with diabetes this can lead to unexplained blood sugar spikes even before eating the first meal of the day starting the morning with a sense of calm and control contr can significantly improve glucose stability throughout the day the way the body responds to stress is deeply connected to how well it regulates insulin chronic stress not only raises blood sugar levels but also increases cravings for high carb and sugary Foods making it more difficult to maintain healthy eating habits one of the most effective ways to reduce morning stress is through intentional mindfulness practices deep Brea breathing exercises even for just a few minutes help lower cortisol levels and improve insulin sensitivity journaling gratitude or setting a positive intention for the day can shift the mindset from stress to focus gentle stretching or a short morning walk can further support relaxation by releasing tension and improving circulation small changes in the morning can prevent stress from taking control avoiding the Rush by waking up a little earlier reducing screen time upon waking and creating a calming routine can transform the way the body handles stress and blood sugar regulation by prioritizing mental well-being in the morning it becomes easier to navigate daily challenges with Clarity and resilience managing stress is not just about feeling better it is about making choices that support long-term diabetes health and overall well-being six eat an earlier dinner the night before the timing of your last meal plays a crucial role in determining your blood sugar levels the next morning many people focus on what they eat but often Overlook when they eat having a late dinner or snacking before bed can lead to higher fasting blood sugar levels increased insulin resistance and disrupted metabolism when you eat late at night your body has less time to process glucose before sleep during the night insulin sensitivity naturally decreases meaning the body does not manage blood sugar as efficiently as it does during the day this often results in elevated blood sugar levels in the morning making it harder to maintain balance throughout the day eating an earlier dinner allows the body to digest and metabolize food before sleep giving insulin a chance to work effectively studies suggests that people who finish dinner at least 2 to 3 hours before bedtime have better fasting glucose levels and improved overall metabolic Health aligning meal timing with the body&amp;#39;s natural circadian rhythm supports better blood sugar regulation energy balance and digestion choosing a dinner rich in lean proteins fiber and healthy fats while minimizing processed carbohydrates can further support glucose stability overnight foods like grilled fish with roasted vegetables a salad with avocado and nuts or a bowl of lentil soup provide lasting nourishment without overwhelming the body&amp;#39;s ability to manage blood sugar breaking the habit of late night eating is not always easy but small steps like setting a fixed dinner time avoiding late snacks and staying hydrated can create lasting improvements in blood sugar control an earlier dinner is not just about better numbers in the morning it is about giving your body the time it needs to rest recover and function at its best conclusion establishing a Mindful and structured morning routine is one of the most powerful ways to manage blood sugar naturally each of these six habits hydrating first thing in the morning eating a protein and fiber rich breakfast limiting caffeine or pairing it with protein moving the body for at least 10 minutes managing stress before it escalates and eating an earlier dinner the night before plays a critical role in stabilizing glucose levels and improving overall metabolic health for individuals prone to hypoglycemia these habits are equally important starting the day with with proper hydration and a well-balanced breakfast helps prevent sudden drops in blood sugar reducing the risk of dizziness fatigue and irritability corporating protein and fiber in the morning slows glucose absorption preventing drastic swings that can leave the body feeling weak or unsteady moderate physical activity further supports glucose regulation by ensuring that sugar is efficiently utilized by the muscles rather than left to fluctuate unpredictably in the bloodstream managing stress is particularly crucial for those who experience frequent low blood sugar episodes stress hormones such as cortisol can interfere with blood sugar stability making hypoglycemia episodes more difficult to predict and control by practicing relaxation techniques in the morning such as deep breathing or mindfulness individuals can create a sense of calm that carries throughout the day helping to regulate both energy and glucose levels the effectiveness of these habits is not seen in a single day but rather through consistent practice over time small intentional changes lead to long-term improvements in blood sugar management energy levels and overall well-being by prioritizing these simple yet impactful morning routines individuals with diabetes can take meaningful steps toward achieving Better Health and a greater sense of balance in daily life if you find these tips helpful please leave a comment

from Wegman&amp;#39;s it was grilled lemon and garlic grilled chicken was very good was very good plus I had asparagus uh with um some cheese on it and lemon oh that was also good uh but no calories in that you know no calories I mean no no more protein less calories and it was filling and I was good so I you know I&amp;#39;m I&amp;#39;m now learning how to I&amp;#39;m beginning to learn how to actually really look at my labels and what I&amp;#39;m what I&amp;#39;m eating um I will say I think was it this week probably this week uh we were out and I was going to cook something but we got back late and I said Perry take me to uh Chick-fil-A so I did get chck Chick-fil-A but I got actually this time I got the the chicken strips I didn&amp;#39;t get grilled chicken I got the chicken strips cuz I wanted it but I got the chicken strips and I and a and a salad and I ate the chicken strips and most of the salad I didn&amp;#39;t eat you know cuz the salad had a lot of calories and for some odd reason I was like why salary got so why does the Sal salad have that much but I think that with counting the croutons and things like that I didn&amp;#39;t even touch the croutons and I if you want to say half of that say that but I didn&amp;#39;t eat that much of that salad and the grilled um the grilled chicken strips yes I ate that uh with with some uh Chick-fil-A sauce I ate it and done but I don&amp;#39;t think that particular day I don&amp;#39;t think I ate too much either that might have been on was it on Wednesday it must have been Tuesday or Monday but it wasn&amp;#39;t on Wednesday so I I think it maybe was Monday because I didn&amp;#39;t eat that much Monday I was like not feeling too good you know so it one of them days but Monday or Tuesday I I I ate it and so I I see that when I go out um I I make much better choices much much better choices so when I ate my turkey burger today of course Perry would not eat that he doesn&amp;#39;t eat that so I told him make what you want then you know he like chicken po pie go make that eat that have a good time but me uh I didn&amp;#39;t touch it and and and you do have to be uh careful even when you eating out or not eating out you got to watch your sodium because when you do eat out you don&amp;#39;t know what they put in there you don&amp;#39;t know how much sodium and stuff is in things it&amp;#39;s really the best thing to do is read and find out what you are eating because if you did eat a too much sodium then you can have water retention of course you know so of course that&amp;#39;s going to make you heavy and and give you inflammation by the way so you really want to watch the sodium intake but you know sometimes you have to so you know you have to live your life so you know you can&amp;#39;t I just I&amp;#39;m not I can&amp;#39;t sit in the house and just like only cook you know and I want to say one more thing right right about here when I retired I was so pissed off I&amp;#39;d say that I am home all the time and I got to cook all my meals and I don&amp;#39;t eat lunch much but I got to cook breakfast and I got to cook dinner and I got to cook breakfast and I got to cook in and I got to wash dishes and I got to wash this and I just it&amp;#39;s like it&amp;#39;s like I&amp;#39;m one house around and if anybody know me they know I don&amp;#39;t like no house arrest but and I kind of like maybe rebelled against it so I would eat out just because I didn&amp;#39;t want to to cook or or or or um you know or or clean up after you cook and all that nonsense I didn&amp;#39;t really want to do it but you know for my own health I&amp;#39;m not doing it for Perry or anybody I&amp;#39;m doing for me I find a way to cook my food or I if I got it from Wegman&amp;#39;s which I did I bought a whole a few things from Wegman yesterday but um there some of it most of it is already prepared it has uh whatever you know the um ingredients is in it not too much sodium in it you know it&amp;#39;s I mean I think I can eat it cuz I generally don&amp;#39;t eat too much sodium to begin with so it didn&amp;#39;t have too much too much sodium in it um but but uh you know I&amp;#39;m I&amp;#39;m not so pissed off anymore I will go and cook because I know I got to I know it&amp;#39;s good for me so it&amp;#39;s not about really anybody else but me but I felt like it was like oh I gotta cook oh I hate cooking that&amp;#39;s I hate cooking you know you all know I don&amp;#39;t hate cooking I just don&amp;#39;t want to do it every day that&amp;#39;s all I don&amp;#39;t want to cook every single day I have never wanted to cook every day and I still don&amp;#39;t want to cook every day and when I was working don&amp;#39;t care where I was working sometimes I was working really close to my house but I always had to walk to here from here to there so I got my walking in and I could have stopped at the store and bought a sandwich and sandwich is one of those things that I like to eat I really like sandwiches you know and there&amp;#39;s some bread in it in it of course but I like sandwiches so I might stop and get a sandwich here and maybe eat it for lunch or half of it for lunch or a bagel with tuna which is one of my favorites know I can&amp;#39;t eat a bagel with tuna but today I&amp;#39;m just thinking about all that now I digress but I&amp;#39;m going I was looking uh when Perry actually he had hot dogs today for his dinner and I looked at that package I didn&amp;#39;t even look at how much sodium was in it but I looked at that package and it only had I think about eight or n gram of protein per hot dog that&amp;#39;s it and it was 160 calories per hot dog so I said you know how many of these hot dogs I got to eat just to get enough protein I be sick anyway because it was it&amp;#39;s just kind of ridiculous for me I said that is what I&amp;#39;ve been doing like I would eat those kind of things that don&amp;#39;t have enough protein in it and don&amp;#39;t have anything substantial in it and it had if you ate enough of it it&amp;#39;s too much there&amp;#39;s too many calories so you know I think it is really it&amp;#39;s really necessary to track your food especially for you know at first but I think I think it&amp;#39;s kind of good to always kind keep your eye on it um so when I looked at what he was eating I was like even though those hot dog did smell good but I said M I can&amp;#39;t eat that let me go ahead and make my turkey burger and my turkey burger was delicious okay it was delicious all right um I intend to come back uh uh later maybe I don&amp;#39;t know if I going to do it exactly next week because I won&amp;#39;t be home I got stuff to do next week um so I don&amp;#39;t know if I&amp;#39;ll maybe do it on Thursday instead of Friday and let you know how I&amp;#39;m feeling because Thursday will be the day after the shot so I&amp;#39;ll let you know how I&amp;#39;m feeling and maybe let you know how I felt for the whole week if I have a chance I see that&amp;#39;s already I&amp;#39;m already into 21 minutes with my big mouth talking um but I also want to um grab all the stuff the things that I&amp;#39;ve been using to help me on this journey like the um supplements and things like that that I&amp;#39;m using to help me uh make sure that I&amp;#39;m getting all the vitamins and protein and whatever uh things that I need so I&amp;#39;m going to just show you guys it&amp;#39;s going to be a video coming soon that I can show you what I have been eating so far and trying out if I like it or I don&amp;#39;t like it you know I&amp;#39;ll let you know but I&amp;#39;m going to do that too that&amp;#39;s coming up so but for right now I&amp;#39;m down this morning 1 74 not five 174 I didn&amp;#39;t say 174 in a long time I couldn&amp;#39;t get that still scale to move so help me guy I it wouldn&amp;#39;t move I don&amp;#39;t care what I was doing and also oh also I I&amp;#39;ve been I I took a long walk I took like a 30 minute walk uh outside and my knees didn&amp;#39;t really hurt me you know cuz I guess I&amp;#39;m losing some weight and I had the gel shots so I I was able to walk and I did a 30 minute walk when we had a couple of nice days last week and I even though I didn&amp;#39;t feel well I went out and I walked okay or I&amp;#39;ll get on my um elliptical and I&amp;#39;ll I&amp;#39;ll get on there for a few minutes so I can get some steps in so that&amp;#39;s all been it&amp;#39;s all been good I don&amp;#39;t do it every day I will get to doing it at a a a a normal kind of pace you know I&amp;#39;ll get to it especially now that you know the sun is out and you know Daylight Saving Times with last with last Sunday and so it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s lighter outside and it&amp;#39;s warmer kind of uh around it&amp;#39;s very windy out here but it&amp;#39;s still warmer and it&amp;#39;s still lighter and it still makes you feel good so I am happy that I found mro I am happy I think it&amp;#39;s some kind of Miracle draw it just like it does a whole lot for me okay it does a whole lot where I don&amp;#39;t got to worry about eating and a few of my friends have called me or contacted me and said yeah they actually you know they told me that they were on um on WE GOI or mro or OIC and you know um people don&amp;#39;t want to talk about it you know I don&amp;#39;t know why um I don&amp;#39;t know why um I just told a one of my neighbors today that I&amp;#39;m on Monero and I said if you see me look like a crackhead no I&amp;#39;m not a crackhead that&amp;#39;s I&amp;#39;m just I&amp;#39;m just on myo so I personally I think I want to go down at least 30 maybe 40 pounds you know then I really look crackhead like I Lord what&amp;#39;s the what have you been doing you know so but I that&amp;#39;s why I want to say what I&amp;#39;ve been doing and why I&amp;#39;ve been doing it and it may help somebody else and that if I don&amp;#39;t do anything else I hope that I help somebody else cuz you know people are on the fence about this and I&amp;#39;m not I I need to be honest about what I am where I&amp;#39;m at and how I&amp;#39;m my life is and how it&amp;#39;s hard to like get this weight off for all different kinds of reasons and we all must eat you have to eat I mean food is there we need food we just don&amp;#39;t need so much of it and we certainly need to watch what it is and make and give our bodies what our body needs to function so that&amp;#39;s the end of this video it&amp;#39;s been 25

    "transcript": "hey guys hope you&amp;#39;re all well and fine i&amp;#39;m glad to be back here once again and i thank you so much for all your prayers all for your love and for your concern i&amp;#39;ve been sick for some good time and i&amp;#39;m still recuperating hoping to get better soon and move on with my life okay like at this moment i just wanted to make a quick video talking about the basic challenges um people who are living with diabetes in particular in my country that they endure like biggest challenges one being stigma and discrimination and also the bad misconceptions about individuals living with t1 now to my emphasis is on stigma because i came from a point of when i was diagnosed in 2014 uh most people knew i wouldn&amp;#39;t make it like get to this level i am and i&amp;#39;ve lived with the condition uh for 18 years so it has been traumatic it was so painful yes i got the illness when i was just 14 years and coping up it was a process on the journey i met so many things i met so many challenges and it wasn&amp;#39;t easy for me wouldn&amp;#39;t say that diabetes is something that you play around with you have to take absolute care of yourself you have to be strict with your diet you have to be strict with your lifestyle you have to be strict with your medication and most of all your mental health so there&amp;#39;s a point i reached and i felt my mental health was not okay like i had a breakdown and that is why i&amp;#39;m still this state i&amp;#39;m still in but i&amp;#39;m so grateful to god that he has shifted me from that direction from that angle there are so many things that i&amp;#39;ve learned from the time when i was diagnosed till today and i hope to make a big impact in africa so stigma is so common and other misperceptions are still there because practically myself i&amp;#39;ve endured a lot of things people have said yeah she&amp;#39;s a t1d because like you find instances where they&amp;#39;re saying anita used to be like this she was already sickly she cannot move there are certain things that she can do like and i hate that whole entire mentality of anita can&amp;#39;t come up and do something for herself just because i&amp;#39;m a i&amp;#39;ve fought so many battles by the way you just see me here seated but i fought so many battles i&amp;#39;ve seen so many things that any video wouldn&amp;#39;t wish to see i&amp;#39;ve endured a lot so me coming up here and talking everything i&amp;#39;ll be talking will be based on my personal experience but i&amp;#39;m here to tell you that t1s can do anything they want with their lives they can progress in life they can make it in so many different ways and most of all you have to put god in the picture cuz if he wasn&amp;#39;t there i don&amp;#39;t know where i would be like getting this medication getting all the counseling the the support that i had so i&amp;#39;m still grateful for all that i&amp;#39;ve been through there have been big lessons that i&amp;#39;ve learned but i&amp;#39;m here to encourage allies that you are much stronger than you could ever imagine because in a way it was like a form of a test uh getting this illness there&amp;#39;s a reason why god gave it to me but i&amp;#39;m here to tell you that no matter what you can change your life for the best it has taken me years actually to master that art and i&amp;#39;m still trying to improve on it so um these challenges are real they are so painful and so i don&amp;#39;t know the right word to use but it&amp;#39;s so painful to find yourself in such a situation that i&amp;#39;ve been through um but well i hope one day i&amp;#39;ll have to break down this whole story just for the start now um i just wanted to emphasize on the challenges too it comes to medication um when i was sick back just last year getting medication from the place i was admitted the first hospitals admitted that um in that location there was no access to equipment or for diabetics because uh i got to a point where i was sick i had to monitor my sugar levels i didn&amp;#39;t have any uh uh is it the glucose strips glucose strips lancets and the glucometer i was using was of poor quality so in any way we tried in so manyarmacies that were around at that time and he couldn&amp;#39;t access them so i asked myself how are these people in this certain district coping up with this situation of equipment and moreo even when as i had said before i was also diagnosed with anxiety disorder so in the place still where i was at that moment you couldn&amp;#39;t find that medication they had to travel up country no sorry had to go to town uh kala to get the money uh the medicine the equipment that i needed so you find people are faced with that challenge in this situation they have to endure all the costs of selling of buying stuff from the city yeah then another challenge t1ds face um i think it&amp;#39;s the misconceptions yeah i really want to emphasize on that people underestimate um people who are in this condition uh they assume how would i put it they assume you are in a position of not doing and thriving the best in your life because they have this mentality of you will always be sick all bills will be all the money you have will be to cater for the bills in the hospital everything you do because they say like this illness the funny way they say it&amp;#39;s a a disease sorry for those who are rich which in any case is not the thing but well that you can&amp;#39;t change people&amp;#39;s perceptions of thinking and aware of lives so um i&amp;#39;ll be back with another video right now i have to leave see you next time and i hope you learn something from this though it has been short but i&amp;#39;ll come back",

    "transcript": "you could be living with diabetes right now and you wouldn&amp;#39;t even know it diabetes doesn&amp;#39;t just appear one day it slowly destroys the body until the damage becomes irreversible the truth is in most cases the body gives Clues tiny warnings that could save our life if we act fast but we don&amp;#39;t know how to listen in this video I am going to share 10 early signs of diabetes that could save your life these symptoms are your body&amp;#39;s way of warning you don&amp;#39;t ignore them number one One Is frequent urination otherwise known as polyurea frequent urination might seem harmless but it could be your body&amp;#39;s way of waving a red flag for diabetes when your blood sugar levels get too high your kidneys work over time to filter out the extra sugar to flush it out your body produces more urine this means you&amp;#39;ll find yourself running to the bathroom way more than usual it&amp;#39;s not just annoying it&amp;#39;s a sign your body is struggling to balance itself if this happens often don&amp;#39;t brush it off go get tested number two two extreme thirst extreme thirst is one of those signs your body gives when something isn&amp;#39;t quite right and is often an early clue for diabetes here&amp;#39;s why when your blood sugar levels are too high your kidneys step in to flush out the extra sugar they do this by making more urine which means you&amp;#39;re losing a lot of water this process leaves your body dehydrated in response your brain sends out a strong signal to drink more and that&amp;#39;s why you feel thirsty all the time The Thirst doesn&amp;#39;t go away no matter how much water you drink because the root cause high blood sugar is still there if this is happening to you it&amp;#39;s your body trying to tell you something important you might also notice frequent urination or a dry mouth along with this thirst if it doesn&amp;#39;t seem normal and it&amp;#39;s persistent it&amp;#39;s time to see a doctor three unexplained weight loss unexplained weight loss might sound like a dream for some but it could actually be a warning sign of diabetes when your body can&amp;#39;t use sugar that is glucose properly for energy because of insulin issues it starts breaking down fat and muscle for fuel instead this leads to a rapid drop in weight even if you&amp;#39;re eating the same or more than usual it&amp;#39;s not a healthy weight loss it&amp;#39;s your body struggling to find energy because the sugar it needs is stuck in your bloodstream instead of getting into your cells this process can also leave you feeling tired and weak if you&amp;#39;ve noticed significant weight loss without trying combined with other symptoms like frequent urination or extreme thirst it&amp;#39;s worth getting checked out your body might be giving you a clear signal that something is off number four fatigue fatigue is more than just being sleepy it&amp;#39;s a persistent lack of energy that doesn&amp;#39;t go away no matter how much rest you get if you have diabetes your body struggles to turn sugar into energy because of insulin issues this means your cells aren&amp;#39;t getting the fuel they need leaving you feeling completely worn out on top of that high blood sugar can cause dehydration and inflammation both of which add to the exhaustion it&amp;#39;s a vicious cycle you feel tired but no amount of rest or caffeine seems to fix it if this fatigue is constant and comes with other symptoms like frequent urination or unexplained weight loss it&amp;#39;s a red flag your body is telling you it&amp;#39;s struggling and it&amp;#39;s important to listen number five blurry vision have you noticed things looking blurry lately it might not just be your eyes it could be diabetes when blood sugar levels are high they can affect the fluid levels in your eyes high blood sugar pulls fluid from different parts of your body including your eyes this changes the shape of your eyes lens making it hard for you to focus and causing things to look blurry what makes this symptom tricky is that it&amp;#39;s not always constant the blurriness might come and go depending on your blood sugar levels if left untreated diabetes can cause lasting damage to your eyes including conditions like diabetic retinopathy if blurry vision appears suddenly especially alongside other symptoms like fatigue or excessive thirst it&amp;#39;s worth checking your blood BL sugar don&amp;#39;t let your vision be the price of ignoring the signs before we proceed I&amp;#39;d really appreciate it if you could give this video a thumbs up it helps get this video in front of more people on YouTube thanks and let&amp;#39;s continue another early sign of diabetes you should always watch out for is numbness and tingling numbness or tingling in your hands and feet can be an early warning sign of diabetes when blood sugar levels stay high for a long time it can damage your nerves especially in your extremities this is called called diabetic neuropathy and it often starts with a feeling of pins and needles or a loss of sensation in your fingers Toes or both at first it might seem mild or happen only occasionally but over time it can become constant and even painful if the nerves continue to be affected this happens because high blood sugar disrupts blood flow to the nerves cutting off the nutrients they need to stay healthy if you&amp;#39;re noticing these Sensations don&amp;#39;t ignore them number seven is slow wound healing wounds that take forever to heal might seem like a minor annoyance but they could be a serious sign of diabetes high blood sugar causes poor circulation meaning less blood gets to the injury site without enough oxygen and nutrients your body can&amp;#39;t repair the damage as quickly as it should to make matters worse high blood sugar weakens your immune system slowing down your body&amp;#39;s defense against infections this is why even small Cuts or scrapes can linger for weeks or turn into something worse you might notice bruises fading slower or tiny Nicks refusing to close if you&amp;#39;re dealing with slow healing wounds don&amp;#39;t ignore them especially if you&amp;#39;re also experiencing symptoms like thirst fatigue or frequent urination it&amp;#39;s your body&amp;#39;s way of hinting that blood sugar levels might be out of control number eight extreme hunger if you&amp;#39;re always hungry no matter how much you eat it could be a sign of diabetes when your body struggles with insulin sugar can&amp;#39;t enter your cells to provide energy instead it stays in your blood bloodstream leaving your cells empty and your stomach growling for more this constant hunger also called polyphasia might lead you to eat more but it doesn&amp;#39;t solve the issue your cells are still starving and the cycle continues if this extreme hunger comes with other symptoms like unexplained weight loss blurry vision or fatigue it&amp;#39;s time to see a doctor Nine dark patches on the skin dark patches on the skin especially in areas like the neck armpits elbows or groin could be an early sign of diabetes this condition is called acanthosis nigricans it happens when your body has too much insulin a hormone that helps control blood sugar levels when insulin builds up in your bloodstream due to insulin resistance it can trigger skin cells to grow faster than normal these new skin cells produce extra pigment making the affected areas appear darker and thicker the patches often feel soft and velvety to the touch a kosis Niger can is not harmful by itself but it&amp;#39;s a warning sign that your body isn&amp;#39;t using insulin properly which can lead to type 2 diabetes these patches may show up gradually and might even go unnoticed at first if you see them especially alongside symptoms like extreme hunger thirst or fatigue it&amp;#39;s worth getting checked out and lastly frequent infections if you&amp;#39;re getting infections more often than usual it could be your body&amp;#39;s way of hinting that something is wrong possibly diabetes here&amp;#39;s why when your blood sugar levels are consistently High it weakens your immune system by interfering with the function of white blood cells these cells are your body&amp;#39;s first line of defense against germs and when they don&amp;#39;t work properly your ability to fight off infections drops significantly at the same time high blood sugar creates an ideal environment for bacteria and fungi to grow making it easier for infections to take hold and harder for your body to recover you might notice issues like recurrent yeast infections frequent urinary tract infections slow healing Cuts or wounds or even repeated colds these aren&amp;#39;t just coincidences they&amp;#39;re warning signs your body doesn&amp;#39;t develop these problems for no reason it&amp;#39;s trying to alert you to a deeper issue and ignoring these signs could delay a diagnosis if this sounds familiar consider getting your blood sugar tested catching diabetes early can make a huge difference in how well it&amp;#39;s managed so

    "transcript": "in today&amp;#39;s video we&amp;#39;re revealing two dangerous fish that diabetics should never eat doctors and health experts have been warning about the serious risks these fish can pose for those who need to keep their blood sugar in check and the worst part many people eat them without realizing the harm they&amp;#39;re doing to their bodies if there&amp;#39;s one thing I need to tell you today it&amp;#39;s this because avoiding the wrong foods can make all the difference in managing diabetes so if you can grab a pen and paper because this information could help you protect your health before we Dive In let me know in the comments where you&amp;#39;re watching from and of course don&amp;#39;t forget to subscribe to the channel and turn on notifications so you don&amp;#39;t miss any essential tips here on facing diabetes mackerel is often praised as a healthy fish packed with omega-3 fatty acids but did you know that some types of mackerel can actually be dangerous for diabetics many people assume that eating fish is always a good choice but not all fish are created equal some varieties contain high levels of toxins unhealthy fats and even heavy metals that could harm your body instead of helping it if you have diabetes and want to keep your blood sugar stable this is one fish you need to be very careful with one of the biggest concerns with mackerel is its high Mercury content while some types of fish naturally contain small amounts of mercury certain species of mackerel like king mackerel have extremely high levels that can accumulate in the body over time according to the US Food and Drug Administration FDA king mackerel is one of the top fish to avoid void due to its toxic mercury levels why does this matter for diabetics Mercury exposure has been linked to nerve damage insulin resistance and increased inflammation all of which can make managing diabetes much harder another issue with mackerel is how it&amp;#39;s processed and prepared while fresh wild caught mackerel can be a decent option in small amounts many people consume smoked canned or preserved mackerel which often contains high levels of sodium preservatives and unhealthy oils a study in the Journal of iCal nutrition found that excessive sodium intake can worsen insulin resistance raise blood pressure and increase the risk of heart disease three major concerns for diabetics if you already struggle with blood sugar control eating mackerel could be making things even worse without you even realizing it I want to know have you ever checked the mercury levels in the fish you eat drop your answer in the comments your response could help others make healthier choices and remember this is a community where we support each other I read every comment and I truly appreciate you being here so what&amp;#39;s the safest choice if you still want to eat mackerel stick to smaller species like Atlantic or Spanish mackerel which have much lower mercury levels compared to king mackerel but even then it&amp;#39;s best to eat it only in moderation and avoid heavily processed versions always check the labels and if possible choose wild CT options over farmed or mass-produced varieties at the end of the day what you put on your plate has a direct impact on your health choosing the wrong fish could be silently increasing inflammation making blood sugar harder to control and putting your heart at risk and trust me once you hear about the next hidden danger of mackerel you&amp;#39;ll think twice before eating it again most people believe that fish is always a healthy choice but what if I told you that some mackerel contain hidden toxins that could be harming your body while Fresh Fish can be a great source of nutrients certain types of mackerel especially those from polluted Waters or poorly regulated Fisheries can contain harmful chemicals heavy metals and Industrial contaminants that might secretly be damaging your health and for diabetics these toxins can make blood sugar control even more difficult one of the biggest risks with mackerel is polychlorinated by fennels pcbs and dioxins toxic chemicals that accumulate in fish living in polluted environments studies from the Environmental Protection Agency EPA have shown that some species of mackerel contain high levels of pcbs which are linked to hormonal imbalances insulin resistance and an increased risk of metabolic disorders if you have diabetes consuming these toxins regularly could interfere with how your body processes sugar making it harder to maintain stable blood glucose levels another major concern is histamine poisoning also known as scombroid poisoning mackerel is naturally high in histadine an amino acid that when exposed to warm temperatures can turn into histamine a compound that can cause allergic reactions digestive issues and even dangerous spikes in blood pressure according to the Centers for Disease Control and prevention CDC improperly stored or processed mackerel is one of the most common causes of histamine poisoning and since many diabetics already struggle with circulation and cardiovascular health this type of reaction can be even more dangerous before we go any further I have a question for you do you always check where your fish comes from before eating it let me know in the comments your answer might help someone else make a healthier choice and remember this is a community where we support each other I appreciate every comment and I love seeing all of your experiences if you still enjoy mackerel the safest option is to choose wild caught fish from clean regulated Waters look for labels that indicate low mercury content and sustainable fishing practices also be extra careful with canned or preserved mackerel since these often contain added salts preservatives and unhealthy the oils that can negatively impact blood sugar and heart health your health is in your hands and small decisions like choosing the right type of fish can have a huge impact on your well-being the last thing you want is to think you&amp;#39;re eating something healthy when in reality it&amp;#39;s silently affecting your body in ways you don&amp;#39;t even notice and trust me when you hear about the next risk of eating mackerel you&amp;#39;ll be even more careful about what ends up on your plate you might think that eating fish is always a good idea but what if I told you that some types of mackerel could actually be increasing inflammation and making it harder to control your blood sugar while wild caught fish like salmon are known for their anti-inflammatory benefits certain types of mackerel contain an unhealthy balance of fats that may do more harm than good especially for diabetics one of the biggest issues with mackerel is its Omega 6 to Omega-3 ratio while omega-3 fatty acids are great for reducing inflammation and supporting heart health some mackerel species have a dangerously high level of Omega 6 fatty acids according to a study in the American journal of clinical nutrition too much Omega 6 can lead to chronic inflammation insulin resistance and an increased risk of diabetes complications this is a major problem because inflammation is one of the biggest drivers of high blood sugar and poor circulation but that&amp;#39;s not all some farmed mackerel are even worse when mackerel is raised in Fish Farms instead of caught in the wild it is fed an unnatural diet of processed grains soy and other lowquality feed this changes the nutritional profile of the fish making it higher in unhealthy

comment of this video now and get immediate access to the book that will transform your meals today tilapia is one of the most popular fish in the world but is it really as healthy as people think many choose tilapia because it&amp;#39;s cheap mild in flavor and easy to cook but few realize the hidden dangers lurking beneath the surface if you have diabetes eating the wrong kind of tilapia could be increasing inflammation raising blood sugar and even putting your heart at risk let&amp;#39;s break down why this fish might not be as safe as you thought one of the biggest issues with Tilapia is how it&amp;#39;s farmed unlike wild fish which eat a natural diet most tilapia sold in supermarkets is farm raised in crowded artificial ponds to keep up with demand these fish are often fed a processed diet of corn soy and even animal waste according to research published in the Journal of Food Science this unnatural diet changes the fish&amp;#39;s fat composition making it low in beneficial Omega-3s and dangerously high in Omega 6 f F acids and for diabetics this imbalance is a major problem because Omega 6&amp;#39;s fuel chronic inflammation which can worsen insulin resistance and increase the risk of complications another hidden danger toxic chemical exposure studies from the environmental working group ewg have found that farm tilapia often contain traces of industrial pollutants antibiotics and even heavy metals due to poor water quality and overcrowded farming conditions some of these contaminants like like pcbs and dioxins have been linked to metabolic disorders and increased risk of heart disease both of which are serious concerns for diabetics so if you&amp;#39;re eating tilapia regularly you might be unknowingly exposing yourself to substances that could be harming your health over time now I have to ask have you ever noticed that some fish taste different depending on where they come from let me know in the comments your answer might help others make smarter choices and as always this is a community where we support each other I truly appreciate you being here and I read every comment if you still want to eat tilapia the best thing you

you&amp;#39;re serious about controlling your blood sugar reducing inflammation and avoiding harmful toxins choosing the right fish is just as important as avoiding sugar and trust me the next danger of tilapia might shock you even more you won&amp;#39;t believe what Some Farms are feeding these fish tilapia might seem like a healthy choice but do you actually know what&amp;#39;s inside the fish you&amp;#39;re eating the truth is not all tilapia is the same and where it comes from can make a huge difference many farmed tilapia are raised in environments where the water water is heavily contaminated the fish are fed unnatural diets and antibiotics are used excessively if you have diabetes eating this type of fish could be silently harming your body without you even realizing it one of the biggest concerns with Farm tilapia is the quality of the water they live in in some countries tilapia Farms use polluted water from nearby rivers or industrial areas filled with chemicals and bacteria a report from the World Health Organization who found that some Farm tilapia tested positive for Dangerous pathogens that can cause digestive issues weaken the immune system and contribute to inflammation and as we know chronic inflammation is one of the biggest drivers of insulin resistance and diabetes complications but it gets worse some fish farms feed tilapia shocking ingredients to cut costs a study published in the Journal of aquatic animal health found that in some poorly regulated Fish Farms tilapia were being fed animal waste poultry droppings and even leftover fish parts

cheap mass-produced tilapia from poorly regulated Farms you might be putting your health at risk without even realizing it for diabetics this fish could be silently making blood sugar harder to control increasing inflammation and even damaging long-term Health one of the biggest hidden risks of farmed tilapia is the presence of harmful antibiotics because these fish are raised in overcrowded tanks they are highly prone to disease to prevent massive die offs fish Farmers pump the water with antibiotics and chemicals to keep infections under control the problem according to the National Institute for Public Health these antibiotics can remain in the fish and lead to antibiotic resistance in humans over time this can weaken the immune system and make it harder for the body to fight infections naturally something diabetics already struggle with but here&amp;#39;s something even more shocking some Farm tilapia contain traces of cancer linked chemicals a study published in the environmental toxicology Journal found that some tilapia Farms use Bann substances like malachite green and nitrofuran which have been linked to an increased risk of cancer and liver damage now
